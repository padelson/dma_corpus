The Estimated Purchase Price shall be adjusted following the Closing as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_:

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller: (i) in accordance with the Adjustment Principles, a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the

and _clause (ii)_ , the " _Post-Closing Statement_ "), in each case including
reasonable supporting documentation used by Purchaser in the preparation of
the Post-Closing Statement, including the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and each
component of the Purchase Price. The Post-Closing Statement, and the
components thereof, shall be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ and
shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including the Adjustment Principles and the Illustrative
Calculation of Net Working Capital, and the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Following receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Post-
Closing Statement, the Seller shall have forty-five (45) calendar days (the "
_Review Period_ ") to review such Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Post-
Closing Statement (including the determination of the Purchase Price). In
connection with the review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Post-
Closing Statement, Purchaser shall give, and shall cause the Company and its
Affiliates and Representatives to give, to the Seller and its Representatives
reasonable and prompt access to the books, records and other materials of the
Company and the personnel of, and work papers prepared by or for, Purchaser or
the Company or their respective accountants and Representatives, including to
such historical financial information of the Company (to the extent in
Purchasers or its Representatives or Affiliates possession), in each case
that reasonably relate to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Post-
Closing Statement, as the Seller or its Representatives may reasonably
request, in order to permit the timely and complete review of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Post-Closing Statement by the Seller in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_; _provided_ that such access shall be in a
manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of
Purchaser or the Company. If the Seller has accepted such Closing Date Balance
Sheet and Post-Closing Statement in writing or has not given written notice
to Purchaser setting forth any objection of the Seller to such Closing Date
Balance Sheet and/or Post-Closing Statement (a " _Statement of Objections_ ")
prior to the expiration of the

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Review Period, then the Post-Closing Statement (including the determination
of the Purchase Price) shall be final and binding upon the parties. In the
event that the Seller delivers a Statement of Objections during the Review
Period, each of Purchaser and the Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections within forty-five (45) calendar days following the
receipt by Purchaser of such Statement of Objections (any unresolved
objection following such forty-five (45)-calendar day period, a " _Dispute_
"). After such forty-five (45)-calendar day period, any item or matter that is
not a Dispute shall become final and binding, unless the resolution of any
item or matter objected to in the Statement of Objections affects any such
aspect, or presupposes the inaccuracy of any such aspect, in which case such
aspect shall, notwithstanding the failure to dispute such aspect in the
Statement of Objections, be considered disputed in the Statement of
Objections. If Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve all objections
during such forty-five (45)-calendar day period, then any remaining Disputes,
and only such remaining Disputes, shall be resolved by Deloitte LLP ("
_Deloitte_ ") or, if Deloitte is not available for such engagement or at the
time of such proposed engagement is no longer independent, such other
nationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm reasonably
agreed to by Purchaser and the Seller (Deloitte or, if such Person is unable
or unwilling to serve in such capacity (or the parties otherwise mutually
determine), such other accounting firm agreed to by Purchaser or the Seller,
the " _Settlement Accountant_ "). If Purchaser and the Seller cannot agree on
an accounting firm within forty (40) calendar days of determining that a
Settlement Accountant other than Deloitte must be appointed as contemplated
by the preceding sentence, then the Seller and/or Purchaser may submit a
request to the American Arbitration Association requesting appointment of a
nationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm to serve as
the Settlement Accountant. The Settlement Accountant shall be instructed to
resolve any such remaining Disputes in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including the Adjustment Principles and the Illustrative
Calculation of Net Working Capital, and the books and records of the Company,
within sixty (60) calendar days after its appointment. The resolution of such
Disputes by the Settlement Accountant shall: (i) be set forth in writing; (ii)
be within the range of values established for such amount as determined by
reference to the value assigned to such amount by the Seller in the Statement
of Objections and by Purchaser in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Post-
Closing Statement (to the extent such item was included therein, and in the
event such item was not included therein, such amount assigned to such item
shall be deemed to be zero); (iii) constitute an arbitral award; and (iv) be
conclusive and binding upon all of the parties upon which a judgment may be
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Post-Closing Statement, as
modified in accordance with such resolution, shall become final and binding
upon all parties. During the review by the Settlement Accountant, Purchaser
and the Seller and their respective accountants shall each make available to
the Settlement Accountant interviews with such individuals, and such
information, books and records and work papers as may be reasonably required
by the Settlement Accountant to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of each
of Purchaser, the Seller and the Company shall not be obligated to make any
work papers available to the Settlement Accountant except in accordance with
such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after the
Settlement Accountant has signed a customary agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants. Each of Purchaser and the Seller agrees that it shall not have
any right to, and shall not, institute any Action of any kind challenging such
determination by the Settlement Accountant, except that the foregoing shall
not preclude an Action to enforce such determination or to challenge the
Settlement Accountants

 



17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 determination on the ground that such determination is inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement. The Settlement Accountant shall only decide the
specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision for each
disputed amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item
in the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Post-Closing Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively.

 

(c) For the purpose of complying with the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)_, Purchaser and the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with and make available
to each other and their respective Representatives all information, records,
data and working papers reasonably related to the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Post-Closing Statement, and shall permit access to its facilities and
personnel during normal business hours, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation and review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Post-Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.
If Purchaser and the Company, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other
hand, breach their respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_,
the dispute periods set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ shall automatically
be extended until such breach is cured by the breaching party.

(d) All fees and expenses of the Settlement Accountant incurred pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Seller, on the other hand, in proportion to the final allocation made by
the Settlement Accountant of the disputed items weighted in relation to the
claims made by the Seller and Purchaser, such that the prevailing party pays
the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if the
Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than
the amount determined by Purchaser and if the Settlement Accountant
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Seller $300 of the $1,000
contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Settlement Accountant
shall be allocated thirty percent (30%) (i.e., 300 _divided_ by 1,000) to
Purchaser and seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700 _divided_ by 1,000) to the
Seller.

 

(e) The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Post-Closing Statement, as
prepared and determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_ and _Section_ __
_ 2.7(b)_, shall be deemed final and binding for all purposes upon the
earliest of: (i) the failure of the Seller to deliver a Statement of
Objections to Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review Period; (ii)
the resolution of all Disputes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ by the
Seller and Purchaser; and (iii) the resolution of all Disputes pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ by the Settlement Accountant. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Final Closing Statement_ " means the Post-Closing Statement,
as finally determined (including by modification or adjustment) pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and the " _Final
Purchase Price_ " means the Purchase Price as calculated based on Net Working
Capital, Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses, and
PP Adjustment Escrow Amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement.

(f) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (such
excess amount, the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ "), then Purchaser shall pay,
or cause to be paid, the Seller Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Seller in accordance with the instructions
provided by the Seller. If the Estimated Purchase Price

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 exceeds the Final Purchase Price (such excess amount (up to the amount held
in the PP Adjustment Escrow Fund), the " _Purchaser Adjustment Amount_ "),
then any such excess shall be paid solely out of the PP Adjustment Escrow
Account (to the extent of the PP Adjustment Escrow Fund), and the Seller and
Purchaser shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay
to Purchaser the Purchaser Adjustment Amount from the PP Adjustment Escrow
Account and, if the amount in the PP Adjustment Escrow Account is less than
the Purchaser Adjustment Amount, then Purchaser shall be entitled to the full
amount on deposit in the PP Adjustment Escrow Account. Such joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent shall include instructions to release the
remaining amount (if any) of the PP Adjustment Escrow Fund as specified by the
Seller. Purchaser hereby agrees that its sole source of recovery under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_ shall be limited to, and shall not exceed in the
aggregate, the PP Adjustment Escrow Amount. Any payment pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be made within three (3) Business Days after the
Final Closing Statement and the Final Purchase Price have been determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, payment of
the: (i) Seller Adjustment Amount, if any, in accordance with the wiring
instructions provided by the Seller, shall constitute full satisfaction of any
obligation of Purchaser to make such payment to the Seller; and (ii) Purchaser
Adjustment Amount through a release of funds in the PP Adjustment
Escrow Account, in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by
Purchaser, shall constitute full satisfaction of any obligation of the Seller
to make such payment to Purchaser. The parties shall treat all payments made
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_ as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(g) Each of Purchaser, the Company and the Seller acknowledges and agrees
that the Purchase Price adjustment provisions set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 2.7_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser, the Company and
the Seller (other than with respect to any recourse under any representation
and warranty insurance policy obtained by Purchaser or its Affiliates) with
respect to (i) determining whether or not any adjustment would be made to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ (whether or not any such
adjustment was, in fact, made), (ii) determining the amount of any such
adjustment and/or (iii) any other claims relating to any of the components of
the Purchase Price.

 

Section 2.8 _PP Adjustment Escrow Fund_.

 

The PP Adjustment Escrow Fund shall be managed and released by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the terms
hereof, including _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_. In the event of a conflict between
the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
govern.

 hereunder. Purchaser has delivered to the Company a true, correct and
complete copy of the fully-executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the

Purchaser and Barclays Bank PLC, pursuant to which the financial institutions
identified therein (the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") have committed, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein
(the " _Debt Financing_ "), together with true, correct and complete copies of
any related fee letters (solely in the case of any such fee letters, with
only the fee amounts and percentages, pricing caps, and other economic or
commercially sensitive terms redacted (none of which redacted terms or amounts
would adversely affect the amount or availability of (or impose any
additional conditions on the availability of) the Debt Financing); _provided_
that references to the subject of any "flex" terms shall not be so redacted).
Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
or other fees required in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are
due and payable on or prior to the date hereof and will fully pay (or cause to
be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required in connection

Commitment Letter and provided to the Company on or prior to the date hereof
shall not constitute an amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment
Letter) except in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, no such amendment
or modification is contemplated as of the date hereof (excluding any amendment
to the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed

would not delay, prevent or make less likely the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter), and, as of the date
hereof, the respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters
have not been withdrawn, terminated, rescinded, amended or modified in any
respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect as of the date

hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
(ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to (A) constitute a default or breach on the
part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party thereto,

a failure of any condition to the Debt Financing or (C) to the Knowledge of
Purchaser otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing being
unavailable on the date of the Closing ( _provided_ that Purchaser is not
making any representation or warranty in this sentence regarding the effect
of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in _Article III_

on or prior to the Closing Date ( _provided_ that Purchaser is not making any
representation or warranty regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ or
noncompliance by the Company or the Seller of their obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_). There are no conditions precedent or contingencies to
the obligations of the parties under the Debt Commitment Letter (including
pursuant to any "flex" provisions or otherwise) to make the full amount of the
Debt Financing available to Purchaser on the terms therein or otherwise
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, except as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof,

which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or as otherwise provided to the
Company on or prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees that
under the terms of this Agreement, Purchasers obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not in any way contingent upon
or otherwise subject to Purchasers consummation of any financing arrangements
or receipt of third-party financing.

 

Section 5.6 _Solvency_.

 

Assuming (a) the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ are
true and correct, (b) compliance in all material respects by the Seller and
the Company with their respective obligations hereunder, (c) the satisfaction
of the conditions to Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ and (d)
immediately prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries are
Solvent, then immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall be
Solvent. For the purpose of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, the term " _Solvent_ "
when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination: (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person shall, as of such date, exceed: (A) the value of all "liabilities
of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date,
as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors; and (B) the amount
that shall be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (ii) such Person shall not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date; and (iii)
such Person shall be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For the purpose of this definition, "not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person shall be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. No transfer of property is being made, and no
obligation is being incurred, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries).

independent review, investigation and analysis (financial and otherwise) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as desired by Purchaser. Purchaser hereby
expressly acknowledges that the Company has provided Purchaser with access to
the personnel, properties, premises and books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for this purpose. Purchaser hereby expressly acknowledges
that its purchase of the Shares and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby are not done in reliance upon any representation or
warranty or omission by, or information from, the Seller, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, employees or Representatives, whether oral or

warranties by the Company and the Seller, as applicable specifically and
expressly set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ (in each case, as
modified by the Company Disclosure Letter or the Seller Disclosure Letter, as
applicable). Purchaser expressly acknowledges that neither the Company, nor

implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the

omission thereof or therein, to Purchaser or any of its Representatives in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares and the transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event shall the foregoing acknowledgments and
disclaimers by Purchaser be deemed to exclude liability for actual fraud
committed by the Seller in the making of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ (in each case, as modified by the
Company Disclosure Letter or Seller Disclosure Letter, as applicable). 

Section 5.10 _Qualifications of Purchaser_.

shall, and the Seller shall cause the Company to (x) give Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access during regular business hours to the
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
reasonable, prior request of Purchaser in connection with the transactions

Subsidiaries, (y) provide Purchaser reasonable access to, and make the
Companys employees reasonably available for any and all joint calls

 employee of the Company with respect to continuing employment and any
compensation- and benefit-related matters must be requested in writing by
Purchaser and must first be approved by and coordinated through the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company (or his designee(s)) and shall be conducted
in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with their responsibilities,
and all other contacts with employees must be coordinated with the Seller. In
no event shall the Company be obligated to provide: (i) such access or
information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing
so may (A) violate applicable Law, an Order, a Contract or any
other obligation of confidentiality or any other obligation owing to a third
Person; (B) jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege or any
other privilege or immunity; or (C) expose the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive, confidential
or personal information; or (ii) any portion of any Tax Return (or supporting
work papers or documents related thereto) of, or with respect to, Holdings LLC
or any of its Affiliates (other than any Tax Return solely and directly
related to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries). In addition, from the
date hereof and prior to the Closing or such earlier date as this Agreement
may be terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company may designate any
competitively sensitive information provided to Purchaser or its
Representatives, Subsidiaries or Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement as
"outside counsel only," and such information shall be given only to
the outside counsel of Purchaser and may not be shared, conveyed, summarized
or otherwise disclosed in any manner with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives (other than such outside counsel),
except as may be expressly agreed in writing by the Company in advance.

(b) All information provided or obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be kept confidential by
Purchaser and its Representatives, Subsidiaries and Affiliates in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

 

Section 6.3 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall (and to the extent applicable, shall
cause their respective Affiliates and equityholders to) use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable but, in any event, no later than the End Date (as defined below),
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including: (i) the obtaining of all necessary approvals under any
applicable Laws required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions
or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities) and the taking of
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an Action by, any Governmental Authority; (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from third parties;
and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated

 



58 ##### Table of Contents

  

 hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly agreed herein,
neither the Seller, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall be obligated to grant any consideration, or pay any fee or other similar
payment, to any third Person from whom consent or approval is required or
requested from or by such third Person in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to obtain any such
consent or approval. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries shall (x) except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, agree or commit to any and all divestitures, licenses or hold
separate or similar arrangements with respect to its businesses, properties or
assets, and agree or commit to any restrictions or limitations on the conduct
of its businesses and (y) use reasonable best efforts to take the actions
specified in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each
case as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals from any Governmental
Authority for any reason in order to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking
any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that no: (A) requirement
for non-action, a waiver, consent, approval or authorization of the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "), any authority enforcing
applicable Law, any state attorney general or any other Governmental
Authority; (B) Order or Action; and (C) other matter relating to any
applicable antitrust, competition or other applicable Law, in each case,
would preclude consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the End
Date. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
except with respect to actions under _clause (y)_ in the prior sentence,
nothing in this Agreement shall require (and "reasonable best efforts" will in
no event require) Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to sell, license, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or encumber any
assets, relationships, contractual rights or arrangements of Purchaser, its
Subsidiaries, the Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates
to the extent that such sale, license, transfer, divestiture, hold separate or
disposal of or encumbrance would, or would reasonably be expected to, result
in an adverse and material change to the business and/or operations of
Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or that would otherwise have an adverse and material impact on the
business and assets of Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of the Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates shall take or agree to take any of the actions
described in the previous sentence without the prior written consent of
Purchaser which, without limiting Purchasers obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 6.3(a)_, may be granted or withheld in Purchasers sole discretion. In
addition, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided and
subject to the parties (and to the extent applicable, their respective
Affiliates) obligations under applicable Law, none of the parties
hereto shall (and such parties shall cause, to the extent applicable, their
respective Affiliates not to) knowingly take, or cause to be taken, any action
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
satisfaction by the End Date of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.1_. Each of Purchaser and the Seller undertakes and agrees (and to the
extent applicable, shall cause their respective Affiliates and equityholders
to undertake and agree) to file: (1) a Notification and Report Form under the
HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement; and (2) such other filings and applications
for approvals and consents as are required under any other applicable Laws as
soon as practicable. Purchaser and the Seller shall seek early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act. Purchaser and the Seller shall be
equally responsible for all filing fees associated with filings pursuant to
the HSR Act and all other antitrust and other regulatory filings with any
Governmental Authority, including those that may be required to be filed in
any other jurisdiction.

antitrust matters or applicable Laws; and (ii) not extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to that party and permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed communication to any of the
foregoing; (ii) consult with the other party prior to participating in any
meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority with
respect to any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (except with respect to Taxes) and
provide the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in any such
meeting, telephone call or discussion; and (iii) furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications (or a
reasonably detailed summary of any oral communications) between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (except with respect to Taxes) and
provide a reasonable opportunity to the other party to comment on letters,
presentations, whitepapers and other substantive communications to
the Governmental Authority and consider, in good faith, any reasonable
comments on such correspondences, filings and written communications.

 

(d) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and equityholders to,
use reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval, and Company and the
Seller shall provide reasonable and prompt cooperation in connection
therewith. Such reasonable best efforts shall include, without limitation,
promptly (and not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof, unless otherwise agreed by the parties) making any draft filing
required in connection with CFIUS Approval in accordance with the DPA,
promptly making any final filing in connection with CFIUS Approval and in
accordance with the DPA after receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no
further comment to the draft filing, and providing any information requested
by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection
with the CFIUS review or investigation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement within the timeframes set forth in the DPA. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to, and
neither the Seller nor the Company shall, without the prior written consent
of Purchaser, take or agree to any action, condition, or restriction required
to

in a Burdensome Condition. If CFIUS informs the parties orally or in writing
that CFIUS has recommended or intends to recommend in a report that the
President of the United States prohibit the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Purchaser may, at its discretion, withdraw the CFIUS filing and the
Company shall cooperate with Purchaser in withdrawing the CFIUS filing.

(f) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take,
permit or approve, or propose to take, permit or approve, any action,
agreement, undertaking or otherwise that would, or that would reasonably be
expected to, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the receipt of
the Security Approval.

with performance periods that are incomplete as of the Closing in

extent that an applicable plan is insured, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the insurance carrier to, give Continuing Employees full
credit for the purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of benefits
(including for the purpose of determining vacation, vesting and severance
benefits) under any benefit and compensation plans (other than any defined
benefit pension plans or retiree medical benefit plans) maintained by
Purchaser for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its

would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

(d) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or to the extent

or its Subsidiarys determination, in good faith, of the amounts earned,
based on actual performance through the Closing; (iii) seek to obtain waivers
of any parachute payment (as described below) from each Person who has or may
have a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection

would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing of: (i)
(A) Purchaser becoming aware of any representation or warranty made by
Purchaser contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ would not reasonably be
expected to be satisfied or (B) any failure of Purchaser to comply with any
covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ would not reasonably be
expected to be satisfied; or (ii) Purchaser becoming aware of the occurrence
or existence of any event, development or change that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.8 _Indemnification; D andO Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to exculpate, indemnify and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of costs and expenses to, all past and present directors,
managers, officers and employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Company _ _Indemnitees_ ") to the same extent such
Company Indemnitees were exculpated, indemnified, held harmless or had the
right to advancement of costs and expenses as of immediately prior to the
Closing by the Company and the Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company
Organizational Documents in existence on the date of this Agreement with, or
for the benefit of, any such Company Indemnitees for matters, acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to: (i) maintain provisions in
the Company Organizational Documents no less favorable with respect to the
exculpation, advancement of costs and expenses and indemnification of the
Company Indemnitees set forth in the Company Organizational Documents as of
the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended or repealed for a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Company Indemnitee; and (ii)
maintain in effect indefinitely following the Closing all rights to
indemnification as provided in any indemnification agreements with any current
or former directors, officers, managers, employees and agents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing with
respect to matters, acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, at its sole
expense, purchase or reimburse the Company for its purchase at Closing of an
extension of (or equivalent insurance with respect to coverage, retentions,
amounts and other material terms to) the current directors and officers
liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail Insurance_") of the Company and
its Subsidiaries covering those Persons who are, or shall be prior to or upon
Closing, covered by the current directors and officers liability insurance
policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
Insured Parties_ ") for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
on terms not less favorable to the Company Insured Parties than those of the
current directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the
Company Insured Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be
required to expend an amount in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
the premium currently paid by Holdings LLC or the Company, as the case may
be, for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if applicable, if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Purchaser shall
cause the Company to obtain a policy with the best coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount. The DandO Tail Insurance shall provide coverage
for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date for losses to which the
Company Insured Parties may be subject for acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall maintain the DandO Tail Insurance in
effect and shall not cancel or modify such insurance for such period of six
(6) years from the Closing Date.

(c) In the event that Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges or
amalgamates into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation; or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any other Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall ensure that
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Purchaser, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries, or, in each
case, all or substantially all of its or their properties and assets, as the
case may be, and their successors and assigns, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim (whether
arising before, at or after the Closing) is made against any of the Company
Indemnitees or the Company Insured Parties on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim. Purchaser
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take all actions required by,
and otherwise comply with, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_. It is
expressly agreed that Company Indemnitees and Company Insured Parties shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective directors, managers, officers or employees.

Section 6.9 _Taxe_ _s_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Transfer Taxes arising out
of, or incurred in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The determination of " _Current Assets_ " and " _Current
Liabilities_ " shall not take into account the effect of any action that
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) take at any time after the Closing and prior to the time
the Post-Closing Statement is deemed final and binding pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.7(b)_ that decreases the amount or value of any Tax asset included as
a Current Asset, or increases the amount or detrimental effect of any Tax
liability included as a Current Liability.

 

(b) Prior to filing, Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a draft copy
of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be filed
between the Closing and the time at which the Post-Closing Statement is deemed
final and binding pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ that would have a
material effect on the determination of Net Working Capital, and each such
Tax Return shall be subject to the Sellers prior written approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) With respect to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to
any taxable period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date
(a " _Straddle Period_ "), for purposes of determining the allocation of Taxes
in any component of the Final Purchase Price, the portion of any Tax that is
allocable to the Taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date
will be: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other Taxes similarly imposed
on a periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
_multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days of such Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including income, capital
gains and similar Taxes), determined as though the Taxable year of the Company
terminated on (and included) the Closing Date; _provided_ that (A) any Taxes
that are the result of or that are attributable to any transactions or actions
that occur on the Closing Date but after the Closing outside the ordinary
course of business (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
exemptions, allowances or deductions generated by the Company Transaction
Expenses) shall not be allocated to the Taxable period that is deemed to end
on the Closing Date; (B) in the event that Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis are attributable to any property which is revalued or re-
assessed on or after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes allocated to
the Taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date shall be
determined without taking into account such revaluation or re-assessment; (C)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each period to which such
exemption, allowance or deduction is applicable, and, to the extent
consistent with Revenue Procedure 2011-29 and applicable Law, the parties
agree to treat seventy percent (70%) of any Company Transaction Expenses that
are success-based fees as 

 



66 ##### Table of Contents

  

 deductible for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in the Taxable period that
is deemed to end on the Closing Date; (D) exemptions, allowances or deductions
generated by the Company Transaction Expenses shall be treated as allocable
to a Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date;
and (E) all income Tax attributes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
including any applicable net operating losses, net capital losses, research
and development Tax credits, research and experimentation Tax credits,
investment Tax credits, foreign Tax credits or other Tax credits, and similar
Tax attributes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that in each case
are allocable to any Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date under the principles of this Agreement shall be utilized to
reduce the current liability for income Taxes otherwise included in the
determination of Net Working Capital, but only to the extent permitted under
applicable Law to be utilized in such period with respect to such current
liability for income Taxes (and, to the extent such Tax attributes are not
utilized to reduce such current liability in such period, such Tax attributes
shall not be included in the calculation of " _Current Assets_ ").

 

(d) Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Seller agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to the others, upon request as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes as the others
may reasonably request.

 

(e) Purchaser covenants that it will file a consolidated U.S. federal
income Tax Return with the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries for the
period starting on the day following the Closing Date and, for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries will become
members of the affiliated group of corporations of which Purchaser is the
common parent or of which Purchaser is a member on the day following the
Closing Date.

 

(f) Unless Purchaser otherwise requests in writing, any Tax sharing, Tax
indemnity, Tax allocation or similar agreements (whether oral or written)
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of or
prior to the Closing (other than any such agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business, including, for example, any Tax gross-up
provision in a credit arrangement or similar Tax provision in any agreement
entered into with third Persons, and agreements not primarily related to
Taxes).

 

(g) The Seller shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
power of attorney with respect to any Tax matters granted by the Seller with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to be terminated as of the day
prior to the Closing Date unless Purchaser requests in writing that, or grants
its written consent for, such power of attorney to remain in effect
thereafter.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser
shall be entitled (after providing written notice to the Seller at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to any deduction or withholding) to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from payments made in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any
other applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law;
_provided_ that if withholding can be reduced or eliminated through the
collection of any Tax forms, including IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, then at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to withholding, Purchaser shall

 



67 ##### Table of Contents

  

 request such Tax forms from any Person for which forms may be necessary (and
provide reasonable opportunity for delivery thereof); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that none of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is or will be subject to any withholding Tax
imposed by the PRC or any other Tax imposed by the PRC, including any Tax
resulting from any transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
applicable Law, including Bulletin 7. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority in
accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction, withholding and payment was made.

 

(i) To the extent that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are
inconsistent with or conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall control in the case of
matters relating to Taxes.

 

Section 6.10 _Closing Date Funded Indebtedness  Pay-off_.

Prior to or upon the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Purchaser with
the Pay-off Letters from each Person designated to receive a payment with
respect to the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness. On the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Purchaser evidence that all Liens on the Companys
and any of its Subsidiaries assets arising as a result of Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, for which Pay-off Letters were delivered pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.5(b)_, shall be released (effective upon the repayment and discharge
of the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness), and Purchaser shall pay to each
Person designated in Pay-off Letters delivered by the Company by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount equal to
the applicable Closing Date Funded Indebtedness upon the Closing pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

 

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing
described in the Debt Commitment Letter at Closing on the terms and conditions
(including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in any fee letter relating to
the Debt Financing) described therein including (i) to maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter until the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Commitment Letter (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreements_
") on terms and conditions (including "flex" provisions) no less favorable to
Purchaser in any material respect than those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to Purchaser and
would not adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated herein or effect the timely funding of the Debt
Financing, (iii) to satisfy all conditions and covenants within the control of
Purchaser in the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Agreements prior to
or concurrently with Closing and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, (iv) to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the Closing and (v) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter (including by using reasonable best efforts

 



68 ##### Table of Contents

  

 to cause the financial institutions providing the Debt Financing to fund the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ that
Purchaser shall not be required to bring any litigation (or similar action)
against any Debt Financing Source). Purchaser shall not enter into any
amendments or modifications to or replacement of, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Debt Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company
if such amendments, modifications, replacements, terminations or waivers would
(A) reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from the Debt
Financing below the amount which, together with cash on hand of Purchaser, in
the aggregate is sufficient for Purchaser to, on the Closing Date, make
payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement, (B) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or adversely impact
the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Agreements or (y) make the
timely funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur on the Closing Date
or (C) release any Debt Financing Source from its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else in this Agreement, no consent from the Company shall be required for any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment
Letter (I) to modify pricing in any manner that does not reduce the amount of
proceeds of the Debt Financing and/or implement or exercise any of
the "market flex" provisions contemplated by any fee letter referenced in the
Debt Commitment Letter, if applicable, or (II) to add additional Debt
Financing Sources). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice (and in any event within three
(3) Business Days) (w) of any amendment or modification to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter, (x) of any actual
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach
or default) by Purchaser (or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party
thereto) of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreements,
(y) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any Person with respect to any actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter
or Debt Financing Agreements of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter
or Debt Financing Agreements, and (z) if for any reason Purchaser determines
in good faith that it is reasonably likely it will not be able to satisfy any
of the obligations to, or otherwise be able to obtain, some or any portion
(and such portion could reasonably be expected to be required to fund the
aggregate amounts required to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
on the Closing Date) of the Debt Financing on the date the Closing would be
required to be consummated. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after the date the Company delivers to Purchaser a written
request, Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in _clause (w)_ , _(x)_ ,
_(y)_ or _(z)_ above. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in
_clause (x)_ ,  _(y)_ or _(z)_ above or if any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the
aggregate amounts required to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from the same
or alternative sources in an amount that, when combined with the amount of
cash on hand at Purchaser, in the aggregate is sufficient for Purchaser to,
on the Closing Date, pay the

 



69 ##### Table of Contents

  

 aggregate amounts required to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement (an " _Alternative Financing_ ") on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Company or Purchaser than
the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "flex"
provisions thereof). Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Debt
Financing" shall include any Alternative Financing, (2) the "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include the commitment letter and any corresponding fee letter
with respect to any Alternative Financing, (3) the "Debt Financing Agreements"
shall include the definitive agreements with respect to any Alternative
Financing and (4) the "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the financing
institutions contemplated to provide any Alternative Financing. Purchaser
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of all material activity concerning the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing, including any Alternative Financing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained herein shall require, and in no event shall the efforts of Purchaser
be deemed or construed to require, Purchaser to (A) pay any fees, any interest
rates or other amounts applicable to the Debt Financing that are, in the
aggregate, in excess of the aggregate amount of fees, interest and other
amounts contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and any fee letter
referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter, if applicable, (B) agree to any
terms or conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) less favorable
in the aggregate to Purchaser than the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter and fee letters as in effect on the date hereof, (C) agree
to amend or waive any condition or term of this Agreement or (D) initiate,
prosecute or maintain any Action against any Debt Financing Source or other
Persons providing the Debt Financing or Persons party to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company and the Seller shall use, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries to use, and shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel and agents to use, reasonable best efforts to
provide to Purchaser, at Purchasers sole expense, reasonable cooperation
requested by Purchaser that is customary or reasonably requested in connection
with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing and causing the
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied, including (i)
participating, to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser (by management
teams with appropriate seniority), in a reasonable number of meetings and
calls (including customary lender or investor meetings and calls between
senior management of the Company and the parties acting as lead arrangers,
bookrunners, underwriters or agents for, and prospective lenders or purchasers
for, the Debt Financing), presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt
Financing at reasonable times and locations mutually agreed, (ii) furnishing
(x) the financial statements which are required to satisfy the conditions set
forth in clauses (a) and (b) of paragraph 6 of Exhibit C of the Debt
Commitment Letter and (y) such other financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and that is
existing and in the possession or control of the Company (including the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of income and cash
flows of the Company for each fiscal quarter subsequent to September 30, 2017
that shall have ended at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing
Date), (iii) executing and delivering customary definitive financing
documentation (including with respect to collateral securing the Debt
Financing) and customary certificates or other similar documents
and instruments as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, in each case, as
necessary and customary in connection with the consummation of the

 Debt Financing, (iv) coordinating customary releases, including releases of
related guarantees, liens and other security interests, (v) if reasonably
requested in writing at least ten (10) days prior to Closing, providing at
least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, and as reasonably requested by
Purchaser, all documentation and other information with respect to the Company
and its Affiliates that any Debt Financing Source has determined is required
by regulatory authorities in connection with applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act,
(vi) reasonably assisting Purchaser in the preparation of customary materials
for rating agency presentations, syndication documents and materials,
including bank information memoranda, lender or investor presentations,
marketing materials and similar documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing, including the execution and delivery of customary
authorization letters in connection therewith, (vii) using reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with the Debt Financing Sources due diligence, to the
extent customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably
interfering with the business of the Company and (viii) in the event Purchaser
notifies the Company that prior to the Closing Date Purchaser desires to offer
debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A in lieu of all or a portion of the Debt
Financing ( _provided_ that such financing would not result in a delay to the
Closing), such cooperation (including customary comfort letters from the
Companys auditors with respect to financial information of Company included
in the offering document for such offering) reasonably requested by Purchaser
with respect to information concerning the Company that is customary and
necessary in connection with a Rule 144A offering of debt securities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) irrespective of the above, no obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such certificate, document or
instrument (other than the customary authorization letters referred to above)
shall be effective until the Closing, and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any such certificate,
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the
entry into any agreement that is effective before the Closing) or that would
be effective prior to the Closing, (B) nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Seller, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or
violate any term or provision of any Contract of the Seller, the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries, (C) none of the Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering or
information document and (D) nothing shall obligate the Seller, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide any information that would
violate any obligations of confidentiality or result in a violation of Law or
loss of any privilege. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller, the
Company and their respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to, any Person
under or in connection with the arrangement or consummation of the Debt
Financing or any alternative financing that Purchaser may raise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation
provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ and that Purchaser shall

fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in
connection with the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or

 Closing occurs, Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees, reasonable and documented accounting fees and
other reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred by

connection with this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_. The Company hereby consents to
the use of the logos of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with

otherwise adversely affect the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or its
reputation or goodwill (or the reputation or goodwill of any of its

_provided_ , _however_ , that any right of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ shall not be
available to such party if the failure to consummate the Closing by the End
Date arises out of, or results from, any material breach by such party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained herein; _provided_
, _further_ , that if on the End Date the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.1(a)_ (Antitrust) or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ (Security Approval) have
not been satisfied but all other conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions shall
be capable of being satisfied), either the Seller or Purchaser may, by
written notice delivered to such other party, extend the End Date by an
additional three (3) months, which extended date shall thereafter be
considered the End Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any right of the
party seeking to extend the End Date pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(_

by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
contained herein;

 

(ii) either the Seller or Purchaser, if any Restraint shall be in effect
and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that

such Restraint arises out of, or results from, any material breach by such
party of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained
herein; or (B) such party is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation contained herein;

 



76 ##### Table of Contents

  

(iii) Purchaser, if there shall have been a breach by the Seller or the
Company of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
failure to satisfy any condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and in any such case such breach: (A) shall by its nature
be incapable of being cured; or (B) if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured by the earlier of: (1) twenty (20) calendar days after written
notice thereof shall have been received by the Seller; or (2) the End Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right of Purchaser under this  _Section_ __
_ 8.2(b)(iii)_ shall not be available if Purchaser is then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation contained herein;

 

(iv) the Seller, if there shall have been a breach by Purchaser of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this

case such breach: (A) shall by its nature be incapable of being cured; or (B)
if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of: (1)
twenty (20) calendar days after written notice thereof shall have
been received by Purchaser; or (2) the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,

three (3) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent waiver is
not prohibited by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
the case of conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, such conditions are
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
_clause (b)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.4_,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

 

Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination; Procedure_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, if, and in the event,
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability or further obligation on
the part of any party hereto arising under or out of this Agreement, except
that: (i) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (Access to Information;
Confidentiality), this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ (Fees and
Expenses), _Article IX_ (Miscellaneous) and the agreements contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (to the extent set forth therein),

 



77 ##### Table of Contents

  

 shall each survive the termination hereof; and (ii) no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for losses, costs and damages
incurred by another party resulting from any willful and material breach by
such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful and
material breach_ " shall mean (A) any deliberate act or failure to act, which
act or failure to act constitutes in and of itself a material breach of this
Agreement, regardless of whether breaching was the conscious object of the act
or failure to act, and (B) without limiting  _clause (A)_ above, (1)
Purchasers breach or failure to take any action that would otherwise be
required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ (Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best
Efforts) and/or (2) Purchasers failure to consummate the Closing giving rise
to a right of termination by the Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)(v)_.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) either the Seller or Purchaser
pursuant to (A) _ Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(ii)_, but only if the applicable
Restraint relates to any Antitrust Laws or Security Approval, (B) _ Section_
__ _ 8.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ and, in the case of this _clause (B)_ , at the time of
such termination, all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_
(No Injunctions or Restraints) (other than as a result of any matter relating
to any Antitrust Laws or Security Approval) and  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
that are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date
of such termination) have been satisfied; or (ii) Purchaser under any other
provision of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and, at the time of such termination, this
Agreement could have been terminated by the Seller under the provisions and
circumstances described in the immediately preceding _clause (_ _i_ _)_ ,
then promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
date of such termination, Purchaser shall pay to the Seller a termination fee
equal to Thirty-One Million Dollars ($31,000,000) (the " _Purchaser
Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated in writing by the Seller.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and the Seller may pursue both
a grant of specific performance of the obligation of Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and the payment of the Purchaser Termination
Fee under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , under no
circumstances shall the Company and the Seller be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of such specific performance requiring Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and the payment of the Purchaser
Termination Fee under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_. In no event shall Purchaser
be required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one occasion
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall prevent the Company or the
Seller from pursuing or obtaining any rights or remedies any such Person may
have under any other provisions of this Agreement which shall be cumulative
and in addition to those rights and remedies set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 8.3_.

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements contained in  _Section_ __
_ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that
without these agreements, the Seller would not have entered into this
Agreement. If either party brings an Action to enforce its rights under this
Agreement, the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party its reasonable
and documented, out-of-pocket professional fees, filing costs and related
fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and
disbursements) in

 



78 ##### Table of Contents

  

 connection with such Action. Solely for the purposes of establishing the
basis for the amount thereof and without limiting any other right or remedies
the Company or the Seller may have at law or in equity or pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, including to recover for the damages, losses and
liabilities of the Seller and the Company (and its Subsidiaries) (which rights
and remedies are cumulative and in addition to any rights set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_), it is agreed that the Purchaser Termination Fee is a
form of liquidated damages (but not an establishment of the aggregate amount
of damages, losses and liabilities suffered by the Seller and the Company
(and its Subsidiaries)), and not a penalty, and the payment of the Purchaser
Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and
sufficient consideration.

 

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2_:

 

(i) all confidential information received by Purchaser or any of
Purchasers Representatives with respect to the business of any other party
or its Affiliates shall be treated in accordance with any applicable
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and which is hereby amended to extend the term
of such agreement for an additional two (2) years from the date of this
Agreement; and

 

(ii) all filings, applications and other submissions made by any party to
any Person, including any Governmental Authority, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable
and not legally prohibited, be withdrawn from such Person by such party.

 

Section 8.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

Other than as expressly provided in this Agreement, including as specifically
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _
6.9_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses, whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Closing occurs, the Company may, at or following the
Closing, pay such fees, costs and expenses of Purchaser (it being understood
and acknowledged that such fees, costs and expenses shall not be considered,
or included as, Company Transaction Expenses or in the calculation of Net
Working Capital or Cash).

a cross-reference is expressly made to such other section in such Disclosure

Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that
any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The Disclosure

of this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
9.5_ shall be void _ab initio_.

 

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_.

 

This Agreement, and any and all claims arising directly or indirectly out of
or otherwise concerning this Agreement (whether based in contract, tort or
otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance

conflicts of laws principles, whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction, that might direct the application of another substantive
Law to govern this Agreement).

the event that an Action involves claims exclusively within the jurisdiction
of the federal courts, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware (all such courts, collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for itself
and with respect to its property; (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of
such Action shall be heard and determined only in any Chosen Court (and the
appropriate respective appellate courts therefrom); (iii) agrees that it shall
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees that, except in
connection with any Action brought against a party in another jurisdiction by

brought. Each party hereto may make service on another party hereto by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, however, shall affect the right of any
person to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. For the
avoidance of doubt, any claims subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be
finally and conclusively determined in accordance with such Section.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO (X) ANY LITIGATION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF
OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ESCROW AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND (Y) ANY
LITIGATION RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR INVOLVING A DEBT
FINANCING SOURCE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section_
__ _ 9.7(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees (i) that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions

principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction, (ii)
that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and any
appellate court thereof, and each party hereto submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts, (iii) not to bring or permit any of its affiliates or representatives
to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action in any other
court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other

Section 9.8 _Privilege; Counsel_.

Skadden has been engaged by Holdings LLC to represent it and the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser (on its
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) hereby: (a) agrees that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser and/or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Holdings LLC and/or any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand, Skadden may represent Holdings LLC in such dispute even
though the interests of Holdings LLC may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Affiliates and even though Skadden may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser or the Company; and (b) waives
any conflict in connection therewith. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf
of its Affiliates) further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, as to all communications among Skadden, Holdings
LLC, the Company and/or the Companys Subsidiaries (including any of their
respective directors, officers, managers, employees or agents) that relate in
any way to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the negotiation of the
same, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence
belongs to Holdings LLC and shall be controlled by Holdings LLC and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates
after the Closing. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
further understands and agrees that the parties have each undertaken
reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-
client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, Purchaser (on
its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees
that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
result in the inadvertent disclosure of information that may be confidential
and/or subject to a claim of privilege. Purchaser (on its behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees that any disclosure
of information that may be confidential and/or subject to a claim of privilege
shall not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of
privilege. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed
information to the appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its existence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates and a third
Person other than a party to this Agreement, the Company may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Skadden to such third Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Holdings LLC. Skadden shall be a third-party beneficiary for the purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_.

 

Section 9.9 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts (which may be
delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission), each of which
together shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

and communications of the parties, whether oral or written, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 Section 9.11 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their successors
and permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be
construed to give any Person, other than the parties and such successors and
permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder; _provided_ ,

Section 9.12 _Severability_.

 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible and in a manner so as
to as closely as possible provide the parties with the intended benefits, net
of the intended burdens, set forth in any such invalid, void or unenforceable
provision.

 Section 9.13 _Specific Performance_.

The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even
if available) would not be an adequate remedy, shall occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it shall not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and/or other equitable relief
on any basis, including the basis that any other party

 



86 ##### Table of Contents

  

 has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of an injunction, specific
performance and/or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking: (a) an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement; (b) to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and/or (c) other equitable relief,
shall not be required to show proof of actual damages or to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such remedy.

 

Section 9.14 _No Setoff_.

 

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates) that it and its Affiliates shall have no right
hereunder or pursuant to applicable Law to, and shall not, offset any amounts
due and owing (or that become due and owing) pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement to any other party hereto or thereto or such
partys Affiliates against any amounts due and owing to such other party or
such other partys Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or any other Contract.

date from which such period is to be calculated shall be excluded from such
count; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the last calendar day of such period
is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day; (x) the measure of a period of one (1) month or year for the
purposes of this Agreement shall be the date of the following month or year
corresponding to the starting date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if no

Purchaser," "made available to Purchaser" or similar expressions shall mean
that Holdings LLC or the Seller, as applicable, and/or the Company has: (A)
posted such materials to the VDR, in a manner that enables viewing of such
materials by Purchaser and its Representatives no later than 8:00 P.M. Eastern

of _Article IV_ , in the case of the Seller, nor the first sentence of
_Article V_ , in the case of Purchaser, shall be construed to constitute a
covenant of any such party for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

Section 9.16 _No Recourse_.

 

Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that no recourse under this Agreement or
any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall
be had against any past, present or future director, officer, agent or
employee of any past, present or future member of the Seller or of any
Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be
imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any past, present or future director,
officer, agent or employee of any past, present or future member of the Seller

Seller under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Debt Financing Sources
shall have any liability to the Seller, the Company or any Person that is an
Affiliate of the Seller or the Company prior to giving effect to the Closing

at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Seller,
the Company nor any Person that is an Affiliate of the Seller or the Company
prior to giving effect to the Closing shall have any rights or claims
directly against any of the Debt Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.
For the avoidance of any doubt, the foregoing shall not impair, supplement, or
otherwise modify any of the commitments and other obligations that the Debt
Financing Sources have under the Debt Commitment Letter to Purchaser or any of
the rights of Purchaser against any of the Debt Financing Sources under the
Debt Commitment Letter.
