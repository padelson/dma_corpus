Closing Balance Sheet has not been prepared on the basis set forth in this
Agreement, that as a result the Closing Tangible NAV is in error by an amount

resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Sellers Objection and (B) the date any disputed

resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Sellers Objection. Purchaser and its accountants
shall, and shall cause the Bank or its successor to, and Seller and its
accountants

 



-20-   shall, promptly provide the other party and its accountants and
representatives full access to all personnel, books and records, data and
financial statements and any other information, including work papers of its
accountants, reasonably requested by the other party to the extent necessary
for such party to review the Closing Balance Sheet or to prepare Sellers
Objection (in the case of Seller) or to review the Sellers Objection (in the
case of Purchaser); _provided_ that such party and its accountants and
representatives have executed all release letters reasonably requested by the
other partys accountants in connection therewith.

 

(d) If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve all of their disagreements
with respect to the determination of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Tangible NAV within the 30-day period after delivery of the Sellers
Objection, they shall refer their remaining differences to an internationally
recognized firm of independent certified U.S. public accountants as to
which Seller and Purchaser mutually agree (the " _CPA Firm_ "), who shall,
limiting their review to matters properly included in the Sellers Objection
and acting as experts and not as arbitrators, determine, on the basis of the
standard set forth in Section 2.03(b) hereof, the Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Tangible NAV. The parties shall instruct the CPA Firm to deliver the
Closing Balance Sheet to Purchaser and Seller no later than 20 Business Days
after the remaining differences underlying Sellers Objection are referred to
the CPA Firm. In making such determination regarding the applicable dispute,
the CPA Firm shall select, with respect to each item in dispute, an amount
between or equal to Purchasers position set forth in the Closing Balance
Sheet and Sellers position as set forth in the Sellers Objection. The CPA
Firms determination shall include a certification that it determined the
Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with this Section 2.03(d) and shall be
conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and Seller, absent clear and manifest
error and subject to the following sentence. The fees and disbursements of the
CPA Firm shall be paid by Purchaser or Seller in proportion to those matters
submitted to the CPA Firm that are resolved against that party, as such fees
and disbursements are allocated by the CPA Firm in accordance with this
Section 2.03 at the time of the CPA Firms determination. The fees and
expenses of Sellers accountants and representatives, incurred in connection
with their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and, if applicable, the
Sellers Objection shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and expenses of
Purchasers accountants and representatives, incurred in connection with their
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and, if applicable, the Sellers Objection
shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser and its accountants and Seller and its
accountants shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Bank or its successor to)
make available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records and any work
papers (including those of the parties respective accountants) relating to
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers Objection and the Closing
Balance Sheet and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. For
the purpose of the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, no change
shall be made with respect to the accounting records of the Bank on which the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or Closing Balance Sheet is to be based that
would prevent, obstruct or otherwise affect the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.03.

 



-21-  (e) If the Closing Tangible NAV exceeds the Estimated Closing Tangible NAV,
Purchaser shall make an adjustment payment to Seller in an amount equal to
such excess. If the Closing Tangible NAV is less than the Estimated Closing
Tangible NAV, Seller shall make an adjustment payment to Purchaser in an
amount equal to such difference. Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.03(e)
shall be made together with interest on the amount of such payment at the
Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual
number of days elapsed, accrued from the Closing Date until, but not
including, the date of payment. Within five days following determination of
the Closing Tangible NAV, any payment payable pursuant to this Section 2.03(e)
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account or accounts designated by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may
be, at least two Business Days prior to the expiration of such five day
period. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be treated for
all tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

2.04 _Bank Merger_.

 

As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Bank and Purchaser Bank shall enter into a mutually agreed form of agreement
(the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Bank will merge with
and into Purchaser Bank following the Effective Time (the " _Bank Merger_ ").
The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective immediately
following the Effective Time.

2.05 _Tax Treatment_.

 

Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that the Stock Sale shall be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a taxable purchase and sale
of the Shares, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall take any position on any
Tax Return, or take any other reporting position, inconsistent with such
treatment, unless otherwise required by any change in applicable Law or in
the interpretation or application thereof.

On or prior to the date of this Agreement, Seller has delivered to Purchaser
a schedule (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), and Purchaser has delivered
to Seller a schedule (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.02 or Section 3.03 (as the case may be) or
to one or more of the covenants contained in Article IV.

 



-22-  3.02 _Representations and Warranties of Seller_.

 

Except as Previously Disclosed, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing (except to the extent
made only as of a specified date, in which case as of such date), that:

(a)  _Organization, Standing and Authority_.

(1) Each of Parent and Seller is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of Parent
and Seller has all corporate (or similar) power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased by it
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
where failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(2) The Bank is a North Carolina-chartered bank duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of North Carolina. The Bank has
all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the character of the
property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. True, complete and correct copies of the
Constituent Documents of the Bank, each as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have been made available to Purchaser. The deposit accounts of the
Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ")
through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law,
and all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due.

(b) _Capital Structure_.

(1) The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 35,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $10.00 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of which
26,219,274 shares are issued and outstanding and none of which are held in
treasury as of the date of this Agreement. All the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable. There are no outstanding or authorized Rights that
would require the Bank to issue, sell or otherwise cause to become
outstanding any of its capital stock. The Bank does not have any commitment to
authorize, issue or sell any shares of Common Stock or other equity interests,
and there are no shares of capital 

 



-23-   stock of the Bank authorized or reserved for issuance. None of the Banks
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock are subject to, or have been
issued in violation of, any preemptive rights. No bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which the
holders of capital stock may vote (" _Voting Debt_ ") have been issued by the
Bank and are outstanding.

 

(2) Seller has good and marketable title to the Shares, free and clear of any
and all Liens (other than restrictions on transfer which arise under
applicable Securities Laws, this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents). Seller is not a party to any voting trust, proxy or other
agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of any capital stock of
the Bank.

(c) _Bank Subsidiaries_.

 

(1) Each Subsidiary of the Bank has been duly organized and is validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction
where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. True, complete and correct
copies of the Constituent Documents of the Banks Subsidiaries, each as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have been made available to
Purchaser.

 

(2) Seller has Previously Disclosed a list of the type and number of
authorized and outstanding equity interests of each of its Subsidiaries,
which represents 100 percent of the equity interests in each such Subsidiary
(the " _Subsidiary Shares_ "). The Bank has good and marketable title to all
of the authorized and outstanding equity interests of each of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any and all Liens (other than restrictions on
transfer which arise under applicable Securities Laws, this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents). There are no outstanding or authorized Rights
that would require any of the Banks Subsidiaries to issue, sell or otherwise
cause to become outstanding any capital stock or other ownership or membership
interests of any of the Banks subsidiaries. None of the Banks Subsidiaries
have any commitment to authorize, issue or sell any equity, membership or
other ownership interests, and there are no equity, membership or other
ownership interests of any of the Banks Subsidiaries authorized or reserved
for issuance. None of the Subsidiary Shares are subject to, or have been
issued in violation of, any preemptive rights. No Voting Debt has been issued
by the any of the Banks Subsidiaries and is outstanding. The Bank is not a
party to any voting trust, proxy or other agreement or understanding with
respect to the voting of any capital stock of its Subsidiaries. Other than

direct or indirect, or any commitment to purchase 

 



-24-   or otherwise acquire, any capital stock or other equity interest, direct or
indirect, in any other Person.

(d) _Corporate Authorization and Binding Effect_. The Transaction Documents
and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action of Sellers prior to the date of
this Agreement. This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of
Sellers, and the other Transaction Documents to which Sellers are or will be a
party have been, or at Closing will be, duly executed and delivered by
Sellers and assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery of the
Transaction Documents by the other parties thereto, constitute, or at Closing
will constitute, valid and binding agreements of Sellers, enforceable against
Sellers in accordance with their respective terms (except as enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles).

(e) _Regulatory Filings; No Defaults_. 

(1) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any
Governmental Authority or other third party are required to be made or
obtained by Sellers or the Bank in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by Sellers of the Transaction Documents to which they are a party,
or to effect the transactions contemplated thereby (including with respect to
the transfers provided for in Section 4.12), _except for_ (A) the filing of
any required applications, filings or notices with the U.S. Department of
Justice, Federal Reserve, the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of
Banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and approval of or non-

or notices pursuant to the securities or blue sky laws of the various states
with respect to the Stock Sale; and (C) such other consents, approvals,
filings or registrations the failure of which to be obtained would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect.

(2) Subject to the receipt of the approvals and consents referred to in
Section 3.02(e)(1) and the expiration of applicable waiting periods, the
execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated thereby do not (A) constitute a violation or breach
of or default under or give rise to (or give rise after the giving of notice,
the passage of time or both) a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation of such Seller or the Bank or any of
the Banks Subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefits to which such Seller,
the Bank or any of the Banks Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of
(i) such Sellers, the Banks or any of the Banks Subsidiaries Constituent
Documents; (ii) any Law applicable to such Seller or the Bank, other than
immaterial violations of Law, or (iii) any Material Contract to which such

such Seller or the Bank and its Subsidiaries, in the case of clause (iii),
other than violations, breaches, defaults, rights or loss which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect; or (B) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the assets of the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Effect._

the calendar months ended thereafter. Each of the statements of financial
condition included in the Financial Statements fairly presents, or will fairly

Bank as of its date, and each of the statements of income and changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows or equivalent statements included in the
Financial Statements fairly presents or will fairly present in all material

the Financial Statements and the allowance for loan losses and for credit
losses shown on any interim balance sheet since the date of such Financial
Statements, as the case may be, were and will be established in accordance
with the practices and experiences of the Bank and its Subsidiaries and were

credit) outstanding as of the date of such balance sheet.

(4) Since December 31, 2010, other than in anticipation of and otherwise in

401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter covering all
Tax law changes through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act

which any such determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued.
Seller has made available to Purchaser a copy of the most recent IRS

ERISA arising in connection with any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
maintained, as of the date of this Agreement or formerly, by it or any of its
ERISA Affiliates. With respect to each Seller Employee Plan subject to Section

Subsidiaries relating to, or change in participation or coverage under any
Seller Employee Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining
such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most
recent fiscal year.

(7) Neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement, shall (either alone or
in conjunction with another event, such as a termination of employment) (A)
entitle any employee of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to any increase
in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this
Agreement, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any
payment of compensation or benefits under any of the Seller Employee
Plans, (C) increase the amount payable or result in any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Seller Employee Plans or (D) result in
payments which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

 



-32-  (8) Each Seller Employee Plan that is in any part a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (A) materially complies
and, at all times after December 31, 2008 has materially complied, both in
form and operation, with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
final regulations thereunder and (B) between January 1, 2005 and December 31,
2008 was operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code, as
determined under applicable guidance of the Treasury and the IRS. No

as nonqualified deferred compensation in the gross income of any current or
former Bank Employee as a result of the operation of Section 409A of the
Code. 

(9) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result
in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Purchaser
or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Bank nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069
or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

(10) Section 3.02(n)(10) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule provides a
complete list of (i) each Person who currently holds a work visa in connection
with his or her employment with the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii)
the type of work visa for each such Person. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
such Person who becomes a Continuing Employee pursuant to Section 4.09(a) of
this Agreement will be unable to continue performing services for the Bank and
its Subsidiaries following the Closing by reason of such Persons failure to
hold a work visa.

(o) _Labor Matters_. None of the Bank nor any of its Affiliates is a party to
any collective bargaining agreement that covers any Bank Employees, and there
are no controversies, grievances or arbitrations pending or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened in writing between the Bank and its Affiliates and any
current or former Bank Employees or any labor or other collective bargaining
unit representing any current or former Bank Employees that could reasonably
be expected to result in a labor strike or material dispute, slow-down or
work stoppage. To the Knowledge of Seller, as of the date of this Agreement,
there is no organizational effort being made or threatened by or on behalf of
any labor union with respect to the Bank Employees.

 

(p) _Taxes_.

Taxes shown on the Tax Returns referred to in clause (A)) have been or will
be timely paid in full on or

 



-33-   before the Closing Date; (C) all deficiencies asserted in writing or
assessments made in writing by the relevant taxing authority in connection
with any of the Tax Returns referred to in clause (A) have been or will be
timely paid in full on or before the Closing Date; and (D) no material issues
that have been raised in writing by the relevant taxing authority in

as of the date of this Agreement, or, if pending, have been adequately
reserved for in the Financial Statements.

in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property
owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification

similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights or by general equity principles).

qualified to do business as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its

correct copies of the Constituent Documents of Purchasers Significant
Subsidiaries, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have been
made available to Seller.

 

(2) Purchaser owns all of the authorized and outstanding equity interests of

applications, filings or notices pursuant to the securities or blue sky laws
of the various states with respect to the issuance of the Stock Consideration

aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

(2) Subject to the receipt of the approvals and consents referred to in
Section 3.03(e)(1) and the expiration of applicable waiting periods, the
execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of the Transaction Documents
to which it is a party and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated thereby do not (A) constitute a violation or breach of or
default under or give rise to (or give rise after the giving of notice, the
passage of time or both) a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation of Purchaser or to a loss of any benefits to which Purchaser
is entitled under any provision of (i) Purchasers Constituent Documents;
(ii) assuming compliance with the requirements referred to in Section
3.03(e)(1), any Law binding upon Purchaser or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, or (iii) any material Contract to which Purchaser or any

similar authorization held by Purchaser or any Significant Subsidiary of
Purchaser, in the case of clause (iii), other than violations, breaches,
defaults, rights or loss which would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Purchaser SEC Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in
the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Purchaser SEC Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement,
no executive officer of Purchaser has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the

unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended
March, 31, 2011 and until the Closing Date, or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Purchaser will provide to Seller when
available similar consolidated unaudited financial statements (including any
related notes and schedules thereto) for each of the fiscal quarters ended
thereafter (collectively, the " _Purchaser Financial Statements_ "). Each of
the statements of financial condition included in the Purchaser Financial
Statements fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Purchaser as of its date, and each of the statements of
income and changes in stockholders equity and cash flows or equivalent 

 



-43-   statements included in the Purchaser Financial Statements fairly presented
in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and changes in cash flows, as the case may be, of
Purchaser for the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved and subject, in each
case, to (A) any matter disclosed in the Purchaser Financial Statements (or
the notes thereto, if applicable), and (B) in the case of the unaudited
financial statements, normal year-end adjustments.

(2) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who have certified certain financial
statements of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, are independent public
accountants as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

(3) Except (A) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business since March 31, 2011 or (B) as reflected or reserved
against in the Purchaser Financial Statements (or notes thereto, if
applicable), since March 31, 2011, Purchaser has not incurred any material
liabilities that would be required to be reflected or reserved against in a
balance sheet of Purchaser prepared in accordance with GAAP as applied in the
preparation of the Purchaser Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2010.

(4) The allowances for loan losses and for credit losses of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries contained in the Purchaser Financial Statements were
established in accordance with the practices and experiences of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, and the allowance for loan losses and for credit losses
shown on any interim balance sheet since the date of such Purchaser Financial
Statements, as the case may be, were and will be adequate under and in
accordance with the requirements of GAAP and the applicable Governmental
Authorities to provide for possible losses on loans (including accrued
interest receivable) and credit commitments (including stand-by letters of
credit) outstanding as of the date of such balance sheet.

(5) Since December 31, 2010, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen
that, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and
events (described in any paragraph of this Section 3.03 or otherwise), would
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(g) _Books and Records and Internal Controls_.

(1) Purchasers books and records and those of its Significant Subsidiaries
have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP (where applicable) and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions, and there are no
material inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind contained or reflected
therein.

 



-44-  (2) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and control of
Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or any of their accountants (including all means
of access thereto and therefrom). Purchaser (A) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Purchaser by others within those entities, and (B) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to Purchasers outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Purchasers board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Purchasers ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Purchasers internal controls over financial reporting. To

any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Customers), including
through branches of Parent or any depository institution Affiliate of Parent

Competing Banking Business is greater than 10 percent of Purchasers aggregate
deposits in such MSA (based on call reports as of the most recent June 30 date

eighteen months after the consummation of such purchase or acquisition even in
the event that such eighteen month period extends beyond the expiration of

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants in this Section 4.06
are necessary in order to induce the parties to enter into and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are required by each party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
each such party would not enter into and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the agreement of the other party to the
covenants contained in this Section 4.06. Each party also agrees not
to challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of the covenants contained
in this Section 4.06 in the future. In the event that any of the provisions of
this Section 4.06 should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, scope,
geographic, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time, scope, geographic or other limitations
enforceable under applicable Law. Each party further acknowledges that a
violation of this Section 4.06 would cause immeasurable injury to the other
party and that, in the event of a breach by such party or its controlled
Affiliates of this Section 4.06, the other party will not have an adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching
party shall be entitled to such equitable and injunctive relief as may be
available to restrain the breaching party and its controlled Affiliates from
the violation of the

 



-59-   provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction and injunctive

Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as prohibiting any party from
pursuing any other remedies available at law or equity for such breach,
including the recovery of damages.

(b) neither Purchaser nor any of its controlled Affiliates (including the Bank
and its Subsidiaries) shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment
or employ any Retained Employee or any WM Advisors; _provided_ , _however_ ,

controlled Affiliates from conducting any general solicitation or general
recruitment effort conducted by a third party and not specifically targeted at
any such Retained Employee or prohibit the solicitation or employment of any
such employee that (1) was terminated by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or

indemnification provisions set forth in such Contracts (if any) solely in the
case of third-party claims which relate to events that occurred prior to the
Closing Date and for which notice is received by the party from which

Continuing Employees.

(c) Purchaser shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
each Continuing Employee who is terminated without cause by Purchaser or its

(provided that the service crediting in this clause (2) shall not apply with
respect to any defined benefit plans, including, without limitation The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan); and (3) cause any deductible,
coinsurance and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents under the Seller Employee Plans

out-of-pocket requirements for the same year under the applicable Purchaser
Plan.

(e) Purchaser shall permit each Continuing Employee who has received an
eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from the RBC-USA Retirement and Savings Plan, if any, to roll such eligible
rollover distribution, including any associated loans, as part of any lump sum
distribution into an account under the Purchasers 401(k) Plan; _provided_

eligibility criteria at the Closing Date, or during the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date, for benefits

"). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Subsidiaries shall
assume all Liabilities for the subsidy for post-retirement medical benefits
under the RBC-USA Retiree Medical Program with respect to Eligible Employees
(which shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the retiree medical
program of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries), and such employees shall cease to
be eligible to participate in the RBC-USA Retiree Medical Program. The
benefits provided to the Eligible Employees under the Purchaser Retiree
Medical Plan shall be no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates.

with such agreements, arrangements, and plans, including, without limitation,
the insurance policies related to the split-dollar insurance plans.

"), Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain, prior to the
Closing, substitute credit support arrangements in replacement for the Support
Obligations, and (ii) procure that Parent and/or its Affiliates (other than
the Bank and its Subsidiaries), and, where applicable, its sureties or letter
of credit issuers, be fully released from its obligations under the Support
Obligations, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller. Seller
will cooperate reasonably with Purchaser with respect to the foregoing.
Purchaser further agrees that to the extent that Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Bank and its Subsidiaries) incurs any Losses in
connection with such Support Obligations after the Closing, Purchaser shall
promptly reimburse Parent for, any and all such Losses, including costs or
expenses in connection with such Support Obligations, including Parents or
its Affiliates reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in maintaining such Support
Obligations, whether or not any such Support Obligation is drawn upon or
required to be performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse Parent to
the extent any Support Obligation is called upon and Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Bank and its Subsidiaries) incur any Losses in
connection with the Support Obligation.

rights and the Transferred Intellectual Property shall be, and hereby are,
assigned to Parent effective as of the Closing. After the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Bank and its Subsidiaries (1) to terminate any and all uses of
any of the Parent Marks and the Transferred Intellectual Property immediately

written disclaimer of any rights to the Parent Marks and the Transferred
Intellectual Property and an acknowledgment that the Parent Marks and the
Transferred Intellectual Property, and the goodwill associated therewith are
proprietary rights belonging to Parent or an Affiliate of Seller (other than
the Bank and its Subsidiaries) and that such entities are the sole owners of
all trademark and other rights, titles and interests in and to the Parent
Marks and the Transferred Intellectual Property, and (3) execute such other
documents requested by Parent from time-to-time to effectuate or evidence the

covenants that purport to limit the freedom from and after the Closing of the

applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
Purchaser and the members of its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents may be consummated as promptly as practicable on

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event that
the Stock Consideration does not equal zero, Purchaser covenants and agrees
that (i) effective at the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and file with the
SEC a shelf registration statement (or, at Purchasers option, designate
an existing shelf registration statement on file with the SEC) to permit
resale by Seller, commencing promptly following the Closing,

 



-70-   whether by means of an underwritten offering or otherwise, of the Purchaser

of all such Purchaser Shares and the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
and (iii) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to facilitate
Sellers resale of such Purchaser Shares (including, as applicable, by
preparing and filing with the SEC a prospectus supplement with respect to

effectiveness of the applicable shelf registration statement, entering into a
customary underwriting agreement, subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings, making available due diligence information reasonably requested
(and of the type customarily provided in connection with due diligence
conducted in connection with a registered public offering of securities) by
underwriters, attorneys and accountants, and otherwise providing customary
cooperation for a resale transaction of the contemplated type).

 

(b) Purchaser shall not be required to effect a registration (including a
resale of from an effective shelf registration statement) or an offering
pursuant to this Section 4.19 during a black-out period during which Purchaser
is not effecting sales or registrations of sales of Purchaser Shares
generally. Purchaser and Seller agree to coordinate in good faith and
Purchaser shall reasonably accommodate Sellers preferred timeframe for

party incurring such expense;  _provided_ that Seller shall bear all
underwriting discounts, commissions or fees.

(c) In the event that the Stock Consideration does not equal zero, Purchaser

To the extent that any Intellectual Property owned by the Bank or any of its

and any of their Affiliates, effective as of the Closing, a non-
exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free,
fully paid-up right and license in, to and under such Intellectual Property,
including the right to (1) make, have made, use, import, offer for sale,
lease, sell and/or otherwise transfer or dispose of any products or services

otherwise exploit any and all of such Intellectual Property.

good faith upon a list of the Transferred Customers (the " _Transferred

of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The list of Retained Customers shall be
the exclusive, proprietary property of Parent, and the list of Transferred
Customers shall be the exclusive, proprietary property of Purchaser.

4.22 _Additional Agreements_.

(including the Bank and its Subsidiaries) to take the actions set forth on
Section 4.22(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

or in connection with client or customer transactions), enter into any hedging
or other transaction or arrangement that is designed to, or which reasonably
could be expected to, lead to or result in a sale, disposition or transfer, in
whole or in part, of any of the economic consequences of ownership of
Purchaser Shares by Parent or its Affiliates.

 

(c) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier
of (1) the second anniversary thereof or (2) the date on which Seller
completes its disposition of the Stock Consideration (which shall be the end
of the Closing Date if the Stock Consideration is equal to zero), in the event
that at any time Parent and its Subsidiaries beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, Purchaser Shares representing in the aggregate 5% or more of the
total number of Purchaser Shares issued and outstanding (as calculated for
purposes of the prior approval requirements of Section 3(a)(3) of the BHC Act)
as of such time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all
actions as promptly as possible (but giving due regard to the state of the
equity and capital markets) to sell the necessary number of Purchaser Shares
so that, immediately after giving effect to such sales, Parent and its
Subsidiaries own, directly and indirectly, Purchaser Shares representing in
the aggregate less than 5% of the total number of Purchaser Shares issued and
outstanding (as calculated for purposes of the prior approval requirements of
Section 3(a)(3) of the BHC Act).

(d) To the extent that Purchaser or Seller identify, prior to the Closing,
any transition services that Purchaser and its Affiliates or Seller and its
Affiliates reasonably require following the Closing and in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to
enter into an agreement for any such services to be provided on commercially
reasonable terms and for a period not to exceed nine months from the Closing 

 



-72-   Date. Purchaser and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents necessary in connection with the foregoing.

 

(e) Parent hereby agrees that promptly after the last day of the Covered
Period (and provided that Purchaser has reported to Parent all sales of
Covered Securities during the Covered Period), Parent shall pay Purchaser an
amount (if any) in cash equal to the greater of (i) the amount of the
Aggregate Realized Losses during the Covered Period net of the amount of
Aggregate Realized Gains during the Covered Period and (ii) zero dollars;
_provided_ that the aggregate amount of cash payments made by Parent to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.22(e) shall not exceed the Aggregate
Payment Obligation. Purchaser agrees that it shall cause Purchaser Bank to
conduct any sales of Covered Securities only with Persons who are not
Affiliates of Purchaser in arms length, commercially reasonable transactions
(recognizing that all such sales may occur at any time after the Closing).

counsel) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") to the extent, directly or indirectly,
resulting from or arising out of:

(1) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by the

than any breach of Section 3.02(p), which shall be governed by Section 4.11,

_Deductible_ ") and then only for the amount of such Losses with respect to
such matters in excess of the Deductible, up to an aggregate maximum amount
payable in excess of the Deductible equal to $850 million (the " _Indemnity

6.03 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article VI, Purchaser shall indemnify Parent, its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, 

 



-76-   directors, employees, agents and representatives (each, a " _Seller
Indemnitee_ ") against, and hold them harmless from, any Losses, as incurred,
to the extent, directly or indirectly, resulting from or arising out of:

(1) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser
in this Agreement (such representations and warranties to be read for this
purpose without reference to any Excluded Purchaser Qualification); _provided_
that if the Stock Consideration shall equal zero, then such
indemnification obligation shall not apply in respect of any breach of any of
the Specified Purchaser Representations, it being further agreed that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
the Stock Consideration shall equal zero, then no Seller Indemnitee shall be
entitled to any monetary remedy whatsoever in respect of any breach of any
such Specified Purchaser Representation, except in the case of fraud,
intentional misconduct or willful breach;

 

(2) any failure by Purchaser to perform any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; and

 

(3) any Liability of the Bank and its Subsidiaries related to their respective

Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 6.02).

(b) Purchaser shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 6.03(a)(1) until the Losses with respect to such matters exceed the

6.04 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(a) Except with respect to Taxes, which are covered by Section 4.11, each
Person entitled to indemnification under this Article VI (the " _Indemnified
Person_ ") shall give notice to the Person required to provide indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") promptly after such Indemnified
Person receives written notice of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
demand asserted by any Person who is not a party (or a successor to a party)
to this Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), setting forth in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances pertaining thereto and the basis for the
Indemnified Persons right to indemnification; _provided_ that the failure by
an Indemnified Person to so notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve
any Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this Article VI, except to
the extent that such failure prejudices such Indemnifying Person. Thereafter,
in the event that the Indemnifying Person assumes the

 



-77-   defense of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 6.04(b), the
Indemnified Person shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Person relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) Except with respect to Taxes, which are covered by Section 4.11, the
Indemnifying Person will have the right to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice, at the
Indemnifying Persons sole cost and expense (which assumption must be made by
the Indemnifying Person, by notice to the Indemnified Person hereto in
writing, within thirty (30) days after having been notified by the Indemnified
Person of the existence of such Third-Party Claims); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Person will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the judgment or proposed settlement
(1) involves only the payment of money damages against which the Indemnified
Person is indemnified by the Indemnifying Person, covers the full amount of
the liability in such Third-Party Claim and releases the Indemnified Person
and its Affiliates from all Liability or obligation in connection with such
Third-Party Claim, (2) does not impose an injunction or other non-monetary
relief upon the Indemnified Person and (3) does not involve a finding or
admission of any violation of Law or other wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Person. Counsel selected by the Indemnifying Person to defend any such Third-
Party Claim shall be a recognized law firm with the experience and resources
to defend the Indemnified Person against any such Third-Party Claim in any
such proceeding (and shall be consented to by the Indemnified Person, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Person elects
to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (A) the Indemnified Person will
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Person and its
attorneys in such defense and (B) the Indemnifying Person will not be liable
to the Indemnified Person for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof. In any such action
or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at its own
expense unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person mutually
agree to the retention of such counsel, or (ii) the Indemnifying Person and
the Indemnified Person have actual or potential differing defenses or
conflicts of interests between them that make joint representation
inappropriate, then in all such cases of clauses (i) and (ii), the
Indemnifying Person shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received,
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Person.
Provided that an Indemnified Person has given the Indemnifying Person notice
of a Third-Party Claim as required hereunder, unless an Indemnifying Person
assumes the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person may
defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem
appropriate, and the Indemnifying Person shall be bound by any final
determination with respect to such Third-Party Claim prior to such
assumption; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person may not agree
to any settlement without the consent of the Indemnifying Person, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each party
shall reasonably cooperate with the other parties by providing records and
information on a timely basis that

 



-78-   are reasonably relevant to any Third-Party Claim, and shall in good faith
regularly consult with counsel for the other parties and include such counsel
in relevant conferences and proceedings to the extent requested by such
counsel. Within ten (10) Business Days of determination of the amount of a
Third-Party Claim becoming non-appealable (whether as a result of procedural
exhaustion or lapse of time), the Indemnifying Person shall pay to the
Indemnified Person an amount equal to the aggregate Losses relating to such
Third-Party Claim by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank
account or accounts designated in writing by the indemnified party not less
than one (1) Business Day prior to such payment.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article
VI, the parties shall cooperate with each other to obtain the benefits of any
insurance coverage for Third-Party Claims that may be in effect at the time a
Third-Party Claim is asserted, and, if any insurance carrier for Parent, any
Affiliate of Seller, Purchaser or the Bank is obligated or agrees to defend
any Third-Party Claim, such defense shall be tendered to such insurance
carrier and the rights of the parties among themselves regarding the
assumption and control of such defense shall be subject to the reasonable
requirements of such insurance carrier. Nothing contained herein shall
obligate any party to obtain or continue after the Closing any insurance
coverage for any period.

 

(d) The amount of any Losses of any Indemnified Person under this Article VI
and Section 4.11 shall be reduced by the amount, if any, (1) received by the
Indemnified Person from any third Person (including, without limitation, any
insurance company or other insurance provider (such amount being referred to
herein as a " _Third-Party Reimbursement_ ")), in respect of the Losses
suffered thereby and (2) of all net Tax benefits actually realized by the
Indemnified Person through a reduction in Taxes otherwise due as a result of
such Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Person. If, after receipt
by an Indemnified Person of an indemnification payment hereunder, such Person
receives a Third-Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses (whether in
whole or in part) for which indemnification was made and such Third-
Party Reimbursement was not taken into account in assessing the amount of
indemnification, then the Indemnified Person shall promptly turn over all or
the relevant portion of such Third-Party Reimbursement to the Indemnifying
Person up to the amount of the indemnification paid pursuant hereto.

(e) No Indemnifying Person shall have any liability under this Article VI
or Section 4.11 for indirect, speculative, special, incidental,
consequential, punitive or similar damages, including lost profits, lost
opportunity costs or lost prospective economic advantage (collectively, "
_Consequential Damages_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall
not apply to any Losses incurred by an Indemnified Person in a Third-Party
Claim that includes claims against the Indemnified Person for Consequential
Damages. Any Indemnified Person that becomes aware of a Loss for which it
seeks indemnification under this Article VI shall be required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Loss, including taking any
actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Person, and an Indemnifying
Person shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent that it is attributable
to the

 



-79-   Indemnified Persons failure to mitigate. Parent and its Affiliates shall
have no liability for any Loss which would not have arisen but for any change
in the accounting policies, practices or procedures adopted by Purchaser or
its Affiliates or for any other act or omission by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Bank) after the Closing Date.

6.05 _Direct Claims_.

If an Indemnified Person has a claim against an Indemnifying Person under
this Agreement that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted
against or sought to be collected from such Indemnifying Person (a " _Direct
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall deliver notice of such Direct Claim
with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Person, setting forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances pertaining thereto and the basis
for the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification. The failure by an
Indemnified Person to so notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this Article VI, except to the
extent that such failure prejudices such Indemnifying Person. Within ten (10)
Business Days of the final determination of the amount of the Direct Claim
pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.05, the Indemnifying Person shall pay
to the Indemnified Person an amount equal to the aggregate Losses relating
to such Direct Claim by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
bank account or accounts designated in writing by the Indemnified Person not
less than one (1) Business Day prior to such payment.

 

6.06 _Exclusive Remedy_.

(a) Notices of claims may not be delivered under this Article VI until after
the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser and the Sellers hereby
acknowledge and agree that their respective sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary damages with respect to any and all claims against any other parties
and their Affiliates for breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions contained in this Article VI and in Section 4.11 and shall be in
lieu of any rights the parties may have under Law with respect thereto, except
in the case of fraud or willful breach, and except with respect to Article II,
Sections 4.04, 4.10 and 4.13 and except as provided in Section 8.09. 

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all amounts paid by Parent or
Purchaser under Section 4.11 or Article VI shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



-80-  ARTICLE VII

Termination

7.01 _Termination_.

 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing as follows:

 

(a) by written agreement of Purchaser and the Sellers;

(b) by any of the parties, by giving written notice of such termination to the
other parties, if any condition to such partys obligations hereunder has not
been satisfied or waived and the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior
to June 30, 2012 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that the terminating
party is not at the time of giving such notice in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; 

(c) by Purchaser, if the Sellers have breached any representation or warranty,
or any such representation or warranty has become untrue or incorrect, or the
Sellers have breached or failed to perform any covenant or agreement,
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to be true or correct or
failure to perform would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in
Section 5.03(a) or 5.03(b) (in either case, as if the Closing Date were
occurring on the date on which the accuracy of the representation or warranty
is being assessed) and is not cured within forty-five (45) days after
the giving of written notice to the Sellers of such breach or is not capable
of being cured not later than the Termination Date; or

 

(d) by Seller, if Purchaser has breached any representation or warranty, or
any such representation or warranty has become untrue or incorrect, or
Purchaser has breached or failed to perform any covenant or agreement,
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to be true and correct or
failure to perform would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth
in Section 5.02(a) or 5.02(b) (in either case, as if the Closing Date were
occurring on the date on which the accuracy of the representation or warranty
is being assessed) and is not cured within forty-five (45) days after the
giving of written notice to Purchaser of such breach or is not capable of
being cured not later than the Termination Date.

7.02  _Effect of Termination_.

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Article VII, this
Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party
hereto shall have any liability to any other party hereto or their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, agents or employees
in connection with this Agreement, except that (a) the obligations of the
parties hereto contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and in

 



-81-   Section 4.03 and this Section 7.02 and Article VIII shall survive and (b)
termination will not relieve any party from liability for any willful and
material breach prior to such termination.

ARTICLE VIII

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.04.

No party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser may assign to one or more of its Subsidiaries the right to acquire

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). Any attempted or
purported assignment in contravention of this provision shall be null and
void.

8.09 _Specific Performance_.

The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not to be performed as required by their specific terms or were to be
otherwise breached, irreparable damage will occur, no adequate remedy at law

shall be entitled, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security,
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches, and to specific
performance of the terms, of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy
at law or equity.

 

8.10 _Severability_.

or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any
circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefore in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances
shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability, of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

8.11 _Parties in Interest_.

 

This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is

permitted assigns.

 



-85-  8.12 _Venue for Resolution of Disputes_.

 

Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in

Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New
York for the County of New York, and (1) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (2) waives any objection to laying venue in any
such action or proceeding in such courts, (3) waives any objection that such
courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
hereto and (4) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 8.07 of this Agreement. Each party hereto further hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that

jurisdiction in such court.
