to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

if the relevant director is aware that such action would breach either of
clauses 5.1 or 5.2.

reasonable efforts to, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause each Target
Company and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents
and advisers (including legal and accounting advisers provided that all
advisers costs shall be for the sole account of and payable by the Purchaser)
to use reasonable efforts to, cooperate with the Purchaser (including (a) (i)
providing any information, documents, agreements, consents, comfort letters,
certifications and representations reasonably requested by the Purchaser, its

investment banks or their legal advisers (which, for the avoidance of doubt,

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b)
enabling the satisfaction and discharge of all financial indebtedness of the
Target Companies and all Encumbrances which have been granted by any Target
Company (including, without limitation, the revolving credit facility
agreement dated 24 May 2011 (the " **RCF** "), the indenture relating to the
Bonds, and the release of security interests in the collateral securing the
Bonds and/or the RCF, in each case on the date of Completion PROVIDED that it
is permissible to give notice to repay or redeem on the basis that notice can
be given on a conditional basis, the condition being Completion occurring and
that there is sufficient time prior to Completion and following satisfaction
of the Merger Condition to give such notice(s) (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, by delivering any notices required to be delivered in connection
with the prepayment, repayment or redemption of any such financial
indebtedness in accordance with the relevant documentation or one or more
conditional notices of redemption to holders of the Bonds in accordance with
the indenture governing the Bonds)) in connection with the satisfaction and
discharge of all financial indebtedness of the Target Companies). For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that any delay or
failure on the part of the Management Shareholders in performing their
obligations under this clause 5.10 shall not defer or entitle the Purchaser to
defer Completion or otherwise excuse the Purchaser to comply with its
obligations to proceed to Completion. The parties further acknowledge and
agree that, to the extent that the provisions of this clause 5.10 require the
Management Shareholders to procure that the financial statements of the Target
Group will be converted from UK GAAP and restated in accordance with US GAAP,
the costs and expenses of such conversion and restatement (including any costs
incurred by

 



      
 

 



 

the Target Group in engaging the auditors of the Target Group to undertake
such conversion and restatement) will be borne directly by the Purchaser.

 



 

5.11 The parties acknowledge and agree that as the Shareholder Loan Amount
will as at Completion exceed the Net Equity Value, the Seller intends to take
certain steps after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to Completion
to adjust the Shareholder Loan Amount to ensure that, on Completion, the
Shareholder Loan Amount is equal to the Net Equity Value less £1.00 (such
adjusted amount, the " **Adjusted Shareholder Loan Amount** "), and the
Purchaser agrees to all such steps (including waiver) being taken provided
that the taking of such steps does not give rise to any detriment to the
Purchaser or to the Target Group. The Seller shall provide the Purchaser with
reasonable notice of all such steps proposed to be taken and shall not take
any such steps without the consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

5.12 To the extent that interest has accrued but has not yet been paid on the
Shareholder Loan or as the case may be the Shareholder Loan Notes, and prior
to the Completion Date, none of the following have occurred:

 



 

(a) the Company and/or SubCo (as relevant) have been issued with a valid
direction from HMRC to pay interest on the Shareholder Loan or as the case may
be the Shareholder Loan Notes free from withholding or deduction of tax; or

 



 

(b) in the case of the Shareholder Loan Notes, the Shareholder Loan Notes have
been listed on the Channel Islands Securities Exchange; or

 



 

(c) some other exemption from withholding or deduction of UK income tax
applies to the interest payable on the Shareholder Loan or as the case may be
the Shareholder Loan Notes,

 



 

the Seller and the Management Shareholders shall or shall procure that
necessary steps are taken to permit the Company and/or SubCo (as the case may
be) to make payments in respect of such interest without any withholding or
deduction of tax.

 



 

5.13 In the case of clause 5.12(c) or where steps are otherwise taken under
clause 5.12 that are not within clause 5.12(a) or (b), no steps shall be taken
by the Seller, the Management Shareholders or the Company without obtaining
the consent of the Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 



 

5.14 It is the expectation of the parties that (i) if one of the matters
referred to in clauses 5.12(a) or (b) has occurred; or (ii) the Purchasers
consent is given in accordance with clause 5.13 to a particular course of
action and the action as consented to is implemented accordingly, then payment
of interest on the Shareholder Loan and/or Shareholder Loan Notes will not be
subject to withholding tax and the Purchaser shall be obliged to procure the
making of the payment referred to in clause 6.2(b) without withholding or
deduction of tax.

 



 

5.15 The Purchaser shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) take any action reasonably requested by the Seller and/or the Management
Shareholders; and/or

 



 

(b) give the Seller and/or the Management Shareholders such reasonable
assistance,

 



 

as may be required for the Seller and the Management Shareholders to take any
steps in accordance with clause 5.12 provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Target Company and
(subject to the prior consent of the Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) all reasonable and properly incurred out of
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in respect of any step
taken in accordance with clause 5.12 shall be for the sole account of the
Seller. Without prejudice to the foregoing, any such costs and expenses
incurred by the Purchaser shall upon production of a valid invoice not later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Completion Date be set off against
the sum payable to the Seller at Completion, and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any such costs and expenses incurred by the Target Companies shall be
Transaction Fees.

 



 

5.16 Notwithstanding any action taken by the Seller under clause 5.12, if the
Company and/or SubCo is required by law to make any withholdings or deductions
in respect of the Shareholder Loan or the Shareholder Loan Notes (whether by
reason of the failure to receive a valid direction from HMRC, any change in
law prior to Completion or otherwise) the Company and/or SubCo shall be
permitted to make such deduction or withholding as is required and shall not
be required to make any additional payments in respect of the Shareholder Loan
or the Shareholder Loan Notes, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained within the Shareholder Loan or the Shareholder Loan Notes or
otherwise agreed between the parties to such instruments.

 



 

5.17 The parties acknowledge and agree that if there is a change of law
relating to withholding tax in the period prior to Completion, the Seller may
be required to take certain steps in accordance with provisions of clauses
5.12(c) and 5.13 provided however that such steps shall be required to be
taken prior to the Completion Date and Completion shall not be deferred by
reason of any such steps required or proposed to be taken.

 



 

5.18 If acting reasonably the Seller and the Purchaser determine that the
steps taken under clauses 5.12 to 5.17 will give rise to detriment to the
Purchaser then the Seller shall be entitled to set-off against any payment due
from the Purchaser to the Seller under this Agreement an amount equal to the
net present value of the cost of the reasonably foreseeable detriment, such
value to be determined and agreed by the Seller and the Purchaser acting
reasonably and in good faith.

 



 

5.19 The Management Shareholders and the Company undertake to the Seller and
the Purchaser to procure that each member of the Target Group will comply with
its obligations to provide information to, and consult with (as the case may
be): (i) the employees of the Target Group; (ii) any relevant employee body of
the employees of the Target Group; or (iii) the appropriate representatives of
the employees of the Target Group (including, without limitation, the European
Works Council), concerning the

 



      
 

 



 

Proposed Transaction and the potential impact of the Proposed Transaction on
the employees of the Target Group.

 



 

5.20 In order to assist each member of the Target Group to comply with its
obligations in clause 5.19, as soon as reasonably practicable following a
request from the Management Shareholders or the Company (such request being
reasonable in the context of the obligations described in clause 5.19), the
Purchaser shall provide the relevant member of the Target Group with such
details of its proposals, if any, that may affect the employees of that Target
Company following Completion. The parties shall update the Seller from time to
time of progress in relation to the consultation.

 



 

5.21 In furtherance of clauses 5.19 and 5.20, and subject to compliance by the
Purchaser with its obligations under clause 5.20, the Management Shareholders
will:

 



 

(a) promptly notify the Purchaser of any material communication received from
any relevant employee body of the employees of the Target Group or the
appropriate representatives of the employees of the Target Group (including,
without limitation, the European Works Council); and

 



 

(b) provide the Purchaser with details of the Target Groups proposed strategy
for complying with the obligations described in clause 5.19, including
providing the Purchaser with copies of any communications intended to be
disseminated as part of information and consultation at such time as will to
the extent practicable allow the Purchaser and the Purchasers legal advisers
a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on such communications and will
keep the Purchaser informed of all material developments.

 



 

 **6.** **COMPLETION**

 



 

6.1 Completion shall take place at the offices of the Sellers Solicitors on
the Completion Date.

 



 

6.2 At Completion:

 



 

(a) the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller by way of electronic transfer (for
same day value) to the Sellers Account an amount equal to £1.00 in payment of
the Seller Consideration;

 



 

(b) the Purchaser shall procure that the relevant Target Companies pay to the
Seller by way of electronic transfer (for same day value) to the Sellers
Account an aggregate amount equal to the Net Equity Value less £1.00 in full
repayment of the Shareholder Loan Amount or the Adjusted Shareholder Loan
Amount (as the case may be) (net of any withholding or deduction required by
law but subject always to clauses 5.12 to 5.17)(the " **Shareholder Loan
Repayment Amount** "), and:

 



 

(i) the Seller hereby agrees and undertakes to the Purchaser and AMC to apply
(from the Shareholder Loan Repayment Amount received under

 



      
 

 



 

clause 6.2(b)) an amount equal to the Equity Amount by way of subscription for
the issue of the Consideration Shares; and

 



 

(ii) AMC shall deliver evidence, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Seller, (A) of the issuance to the Seller of the Consideration Shares;
and (B) that the Consideration Shares have been authorized for listing on
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance; provided, however that
notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of Consideration Shares to be
delivered at Completion would require AMC to obtain stockholder approval prior
to such issuance under applicable rules of the NYSE, then the number of
Consideration Shares AMC is required to issue shall be reduced to the highest
number that would not require AMC to obtain stockholder approval for issuance
(the " **Delivered Shares** ") and AMC shall deliver to the Seller an amount
of cash equal to the product of (A) the difference between the number of
Consideration Shares that would otherwise be required to be delivered at
Completion were it not for this proviso and the Delivered Shares and (B) the
sterling denominated VWAP of the Class A Common Stock over the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days prior to the Completion Statement Date, with the VWAP
converted from US dollars to sterling using the exchange rate on each of those
twenty (20) consecutive trading days as published in the London Financial
Times,

 



 

and the parties agree that the Shareholder Loan Repayment Amount and the
amount payable by the Seller to AMC under this clause 6.2(b)(i) shall be
netted off against the other such that the Purchaser shall only be required to
procure that the net amount (that is, the Shareholder Loan Repayment Amount
less the Equity Amount) is paid to the Seller, and the Seller shall not be
obliged to pay the Equity Amount to AMC;

 



 

(c) the Purchaser shall procure that there is paid to the Sellers Solicitors
Account, on behalf of the Seller and the Company, by way of electronic
transfer (for same day value) an amount equal to the Transaction Fees which
are unpaid as at the Completion Date (as set out in the Completion Statement)
and the Seller and the Company shall direct the Sellers Solicitors to
undertake further payments of such amount to such persons as may be necessary
to settle the obligations of the Target Group to pay such Transaction Fees in
connection with the Proposed Transaction;

 



 

(d) the Purchaser shall for and on behalf of the Company, procure that there
is paid to the Managers Solicitors by way of electronic transfer (for same
day value) to the Managers Solicitors Account an amount equal to fifty per
cent (50%) of the Management Consideration;

 



 

(e) the Purchaser shall procure that there is paid to the Target Group by way
of electronic transfer (for same day value) to the Target Groups Account an
amount equal to the aggregate of the Senior Cash LTIP Payment, the Junior Cash
LTIP Payment and the Employee Transaction Bonuses in each case as set out in
the

 



      
 

 



 

Completion Statement, and the Purchaser undertakes to the Management
Shareholders (for themselves and on behalf of the persons entitled to receive
such payments) to procure that the Target Group:

 



 

(i) pays the Junior Cash LTIP Payment and the Employee Transaction Bonuses (in
each case net of employer and employee deductions required by law in respect
of tax and any other national insurance or social security contributions) to
the persons entitled to receive such payments not later than three (3) months
after the Completion Date; and

 



 

(ii) pays the Senior Cash LTIP Payment (net of employer and employee
deductions required by law in respect of tax and any other national insurance

(g) the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser:

 



 

(i) duly executed transfers in the name of the Purchaser in respect of the
Seller Shares;

 



 

(ii) the share certificates relating to the Seller Shares or an indemnity in
respect of any lost share certificates;

 



 

(iii) the resignation in the agreed form of each of Robert Barr, Fraser
Duncan, Stephen Julius and Julie Williamson as directors of the Company;

 



 

(iv) the Waiver Letter;

 



 

(v) a letter from the Company to SubCo confirming that the "Initial Invested
Amount" as defined in the SubCo articles of association is £281,400,000;

and

 



 

(vii) each document held by the Seller pursuant to clause 5.7 (unless the same
has been received by the Purchaser directly from the Management Shareholders
or the Sellers Solicitors).

 



 

6.3 Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall be obliged to complete the sale
and purchase of any of the Seller Shares unless the sale and purchase of all
of the Seller Shares and all of the SubCo Shares is completed simultaneously.

 



      
 

 



 

6.4 If the obligations of the Seller under clause 6.2(g) (other than the
obligation of the Seller under clause 6.2(g)(iii), provided that if such
resignation letters are not provided the Seller shall have removed the
relevant director from office without compensation being payable and provided
further that in relation to Robbie Barr, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that he may continue to serve his notice period for a period of up to six (6)
months from the date of this Agreement) and/or the obligations of the
Purchaser under clauses 6.2(a) to 6.2(f) or AMC under clause 6.2(b)(ii) are
not complied with on the Completion Date then (i) in the case of non-
compliance by the Seller, the Purchaser or (ii) in the case of non-compliance
by the Purchaser or AMC, the Seller, may by notice in writing to the Purchaser
or the Seller (as the case may be):

 



 

(a) defer Completion and fix a new date for Completion (being not more than
ten (10) Business Days after the initial Completion Date) (so that the
provisions of this clause 6.4 shall apply to Completion as so deferred). In
the case of a failure by the Purchaser or AMC to perform its obligations under
clauses 6.2(a) to 6.2(f) a notice to defer Completion and the setting of a new
date for Completion shall also constitute immediate notice to the Purchaser
Guarantor that it must perform its obligations under clauses 6.2(a) to 6.2(f)
within the revised timetable set under this clause 6.4(a);

 



 

(b) proceed to Completion as far as practicable (without limiting its rights
under this Agreement); or

 



 

(c) terminate this Agreement.

which have accrued before termination (including, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the right to sue in damages for breach of the obligations of the
Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Guarantor pursuant to clauses 6.2(a) to 6.2(f)
or (as the case may be) the Sellers obligation pursuant to clause 6.2(g))
shall continue to exist.

 



 

 **7.** **LEAKAGE**

 



 

7.1 The Seller undertakes to the Purchaser that since the Locked-Box Date
neither it nor any of its Related Persons has received any Leakage nor will it
or any of it Related Persons receive any Leakage from (and including) the date

7.2 Each Management Shareholder severally undertakes to the Purchaser that

Leakage from (and including) the date of this Agreement up to (and including)
Completion.

 



 

7.3 The Seller undertakes to notify the Purchaser in writing as soon as
reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of any breach of clause 7.1 and

between the Locked-Box Date and Completion the Seller shall, subject to
Completion, promptly on demand by the Purchaser pay (on an after tax basis) to
the Purchaser an amount in cash equal to:

 



 

(i) the amount necessary to put the relevant Target Company into the position
they would have been in if the Leakage in breach of clause 7.1 had not
occurred;

 



 

(ii) all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal
and other professional fees and costs, penalties and expenses) incurred by the
Purchaser or any Target Company as a result of such Leakage; and

 



 

(iii) any amount necessary to ensure that after any Tax on a payment made in
accordance with sub-clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Purchaser is left with the
same amount it would have had if the payment was not subject to Tax.

 



 

7.5 If any Leakage is received by a Management Shareholder or any of his
Related Persons between the Locked-Box Date and Completion the relevant
Management Shareholder shall, subject to Completion, promptly on demand by the
Purchaser pay to the Purchaser an amount in cash equal to:

 



 

(i) the amount necessary to put the relevant Target Company into the position
they would have been in if the Leakage in breach of clause 7.2 had not

subject always to the provisions of this clause 7.6 if the Seller or any
Management Shareholder notifies the Purchaser of any Leakage received by or
paid for the benefit of it, him or its or his Related Persons in breach of
clauses 7.4 or 7.5 (as the case may be) prior to or on Completion, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to set off an amount equal to such Leakage
notified to it by either the Seller or the relevant Management Shareholder
(the " **Leakage Set-Off Amount** ") against (in the case of Leakage to the
Seller or one of its Related Persons) the Net Equity Value to be paid to the
Seller as part of the payment of the Shareholder Loan Amount or the Adjusted
Shareholder Loan Amount (as the case may be) (and the Seller, AMC and the
Purchaser agree that such reduction shall also apply as against the
corresponding obligation on the Seller to pay the Equity Amount to AMC in
subscription for the Consideration Shares pursuant to clause 6.2(b)(i) and
shall also correspondingly reduce the obligation of AMC to issue a number of
Consideration Shares

 



       
 

 



 

pursuant to clause 6.2(b)(ii)), or (in the case of Leakage to a Management
Shareholder or one of his Related Persons) the Management Consideration to be
paid to the Management Shareholder who has received or had paid for the
benefit of it, him, or its or his Related Persons on Completion pursuant to
clause 6.2(d), such that the payment of the net amount of the Net Equity Value
or the Management Consideration shall be an absolute discharge of the
Purchasers obligations to pay the Net Equity Value or the Management
Consideration pursuant to clause 6.2(d) and an absolute discharge of the
Sellers obligation to pay such amount pursuant to clause 7.4 or any
Management Shareholders obligation to pay such amount pursuant to clause 7.5.

 



 

7.7 Neither the Seller nor any Management Shareholder shall be liable to make
a payment under this clause 7 unless the Purchaser has notified the Seller or
the relevant Management Shareholder (as the case may be) in writing of the
occurrence of the Leakage to which any such payment relates, stating in
reasonable detail the nature of such Leakage and, if practicable, the amount
claimed, on or before the date falling three (3) months after the date on
which the auditors of the Company sign their audit report on the first set of
annual accounts (within the meaning of Section 471(1) of the Companies Act) of
the Company in respect of the first financial period of the Company ending
after the Completion Date.

 



 

7.8 No liability shall attach to the Seller or any Management Shareholder in
relation to an amount of Leakage to the extent that such Leakage has been
recovered by the Purchaser from another party to this Agreement and
accordingly the Purchaser may only recover once in respect of any particular
item of Leakage.

 



 

7.9 The aggregate maximum liability of the Seller under this clause 7 shall
not in any circumstances exceed the Net Equity Value.

or services to the Target Group;

 



 

(b) knowingly directly or indirectly solicit, endeavour to entice away from
any Target Company, employ or offer to employ, any person employed at

will not, and that it will procure that its Related Persons will not, without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), for a period of twelve (12) months
following the Completion Date, knowingly directly or indirectly solicit or
entice away from any Target Company, any Restricted Employee where the person

 **11.** **GUARANTEE**

 



 

11.1 In consideration of the Seller entering into this Agreement, the
Purchaser Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Seller the due and punctual performance and observance by the Purchaser of all
its obligations, commitments, undertakings and warranties undertaken or
expressed to be undertaken under or pursuant to this Agreement to which it is
party including the payment of court-awarded damages for breach of those
obligations, commitments, undertakings and warranties along with any court-
awarded legal costs arising from claiming for such damages (the " **Guaranteed
Obligations** ").

 



 

11.2 If and whenever the Purchaser defaults for any reason whatsoever in the
performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Purchaser Guarantor
shall forthwith, upon demand, unconditionally perform (or procure performance
of) and satisfy (or procure the satisfaction of) the Guaranteed Obligations in
regard to which such default has been made in the manner prescribed by this
Agreement and so that the same benefits shall be conferred on the Seller as it
would have received if the Guaranteed Obligations had been duly performed and
satisfied by the Purchaser.

 



      
 

 



 

11.3 This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and, accordingly, is to
remain in force until all the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been performed
or satisfied notwithstanding the winding up, liquidation, dissolution or other
incapacity of the Purchaser. This guarantee is in addition to and without
prejudice to and not in substitution for any rights or security which the
Seller may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance of
the Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

11.4 As a separate and independent stipulation, the Purchaser Guarantor agrees
that any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any moneys payable) which
may not be enforceable against or recoverable from the Purchaser by reason of
any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on or of the Purchaser or the
dissolution, amalgamation, reconstruction or reorganisation of the Purchaser
or any other fact or circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this
Agreement) shall nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the
Purchaser Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Purchaser
Guarantor and the Purchaser Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in
respect thereof and shall be performed or paid by the Purchaser Guarantor on
demand.

 



 

11.5 The liability of the Purchaser Guarantor under this clause 11 shall not
be affected, impaired, reduced or released by:

 



 

(a) any variation of the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not
agreed by the Purchaser);

 



 

(b) any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking performance of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any granting of time for, or waiver in relation to, such
performance;

 



 

(c) any change in the status, control or ownership of the Purchaser;

 



 

(d) any insolvency or similar proceedings; or

 



 

(e) any other fact or event which in the absence of this provision would or
might constitute or afford a legal or equitable discharge or release or a
defence to a guarantor.

 



 

 **12.** **ASSIGNMENT**

 



 

12.1 Except as provided in this clause 12 or unless the Seller and the
Purchaser specifically agree in writing, no person shall assign, transfer,
hold on trust or encumber all or any of its rights under this Agreement nor
shall such person grant, declare, create or dispose of any right or interest
in any of them. Any purported assignment in contravention of this clause 12
shall be void. No consent or approval of the Management Shareholders shall be
required to any assignment or otherwise of any rights under this Agreement.

 



 

12.2 The benefits arising under this Agreement or any Transaction Document may

obligations owed by any member of the Purchaser Group to such person, and any
such beneficiary of security may assign all or any of those rights,

 



 

as security for the obligations owed by any member of the Purchaser Group to
such person, and any such beneficiary of security may assign all or any of
those rights for the purpose of enforcing such security assignment or charge,
provided that the Purchaser notifies the Seller of the identity of the
relevant assignee and that notwithstanding any such assignment, the Seller
(and/or its assignee) may, unless it receives notice of enforcement of the
relevant security interest, deal with the Purchaser in connection with all
matters arising under this Agreement; or

 



 

(b) to any member of the Purchasers Group (provided always that the Purchaser
shall procure the re-transfer of any benefit so transferred to the Purchaser
if any such member of the Purchasers Group ceases to be a member of the
Purchasers Group).

 



 

12.3 If an assignment is made in accordance with this clause 12, the liability
of the Seller to the Purchaser under this Agreement shall be no greater than
such liability would have been if the assignment had not occurred.

provided that the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser, where
practicable and lawful to do so, before disclosure occurs (as the case may be)
and shall co-operate with the Purchaser regarding the timing and content of
such disclosure (as the case may be) or any action which the Purchaser may
reasonably elect to take to challenge the validity of such requirement;

 



 

(d) disclosure of Confidential Information to professional advisers on a
confidential basis for the purpose of advising the Seller;

 



 

(e) disclosure of Confidential Information by the Seller to any investors or
prospective investors in any funds managed by the Seller or its Related

days thereof (but after the Seller has had a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon), AMC shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or
such other form under the Securities Act then available to AMC (the " **Form
S-3**") with respect to the resale of the Consideration Shares. AMC shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Form S-3 is declared effective
under the Securities Act as soon as practicable thereafter, and shall maintain
the effectiveness of the Form S-3 for the resale of the Consideration Shares
for so long as the Seller holds any of the Consideration Shares, or until the
Seller is permitted to sell all the Consideration Shares without registration
pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. In connection with
the Form S-3, AMC shall (i) pay any filing fees or other costs and expenses
incurred by AMC in connection with such registration (other than underwriting
discounts and commissions), (ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments
and supplements to such registration and the prospectus used in connection
with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act in connection with resales of the
Consideration Shares, (iii) furnish to the Seller such numbers of copies of a
prospectus conforming to the requirements of the Securities Act, and such
other documents as the Seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate
the disposition of the Consideration Shares, (iv) notify the Seller (A) of any
request by the SEC that AMC amend or supplement such registration statement or
prospectus, or (B) to cease distribution of the prospectus if the prospectus
included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
the light of the circumstances, and, as soon as reasonably practicable, file
with the SEC and furnish to the Seller, a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus such that such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, and (v) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its affiliates from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) caused by or relating to any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement or
prospectus relating to the Consideration Shares, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, except (1) insofar as such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, or expenses are caused by or related to any such untrue statement
or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission so made based upon
information furnished in writing to AMC by the Seller expressly for use
therein or (2) if AMC had notified the Seller to discontinue the use of any
registration statement or prospectus or had previously provided an amended or
supplemented prospectus to the Seller and such amended or supplemented
prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses.

 



      
 

 



 

17.11 Subject to the Seller complying with the provisions of Schedule 4 but
subject to clause 17.25, once the Form S-3 is declared effective by the SEC,
AMC undertakes to the Seller to undertake at the Sellers cost up to two (2)
marketed roadshows, as soon as reasonably practicable following a request from
the Seller, in order to assist the Seller to market any proposed disposal of
the Consideration Shares.

 



 

17.12 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, AMC may acting in good
faith suspend the filing or use of the Form S-3 or any prospectus, if AMC
shall have reasonably determined that because of valid business reasons,
including without limitation any proposal or plan of AMC or any of its
subsidiaries to effect a merger, acquisition, disposition, financing,
reorganization, recapitalization or other transaction, or because of required
public disclosure or filings with the SEC, it is in the best interests of AMC
to suspend such use and prior to suspending such use AMC provides the Seller
with written notice of such suspension, which notice need not specify the
nature of the event giving rise to such suspension; but in no event shall AMC
avail itself of such right to suspend the filing or use of the Form S-3 or any
prospectus for more than 90 days, in the aggregate, in any period of 365
consecutive days. Upon receipt of such notice, the Seller agrees not to sell
any Consideration Shares pursuant to the Form S-3 until the Seller is advised
in writing that the Form S-3 and the prospectus may be used, which notice AMC
agrees to provide promptly following the lapse of the event or circumstances
giving rise to such suspension. The Seller shall keep confidential any
communications received by it from AMC regarding the suspension of the use of
the Form S-3 and/or the prospectus (including the fact of the suspension),
except as required by applicable law.

 



 

17.13 The Seller shall only transfer, sell, or dispose of the Consideration
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Schedule 4, any
applicable prospectus, and all applicable securities laws. The Seller shall be
responsible for the delivery of the prospectus as may be required to any
person to whom the Seller sells any of the Consideration Shares. The Seller
shall not use any free writing prospectus without the consent of AMC.

 



 

17.14 After the Form S-3 becomes effective under the Securities Act, the
Seller agrees that upon receipt of notice of the happening of an event listed
below, the Seller shall forthwith discontinue (and shall cause its agents and
representatives to discontinue) disposition of Consideration Shares and will
not resume disposition of Consideration Shares until the Seller has received
copies of an amended or supplemental Form S-3 or prospectus, or until the
Seller is advised in writing by AMC that the use of the prospectus may be
resumed:

 



 

(a) any request, following effectiveness of the Form S-3 under the Securities
Act, by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority, for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-3 or the prospectus, or for additional
information;

 



 

(b) the issuance by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental
authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form S-3 or of
any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus or the initiation
or threat of any proceedings for that purpose;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) the receipt by AMC of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Consideration Shares
included in the Form S-3 for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for that purpose;

 



 

(d) the occurrence of any event or the existence of any condition or any
information becoming known to AMC that requires the making of any changes in
the Form S-3 or the prospectus or any document incorporated by reference
therein so that the Form S-3 and the prospectus comply in all material
respects with applicable law;

 



 

(e) AMCs reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment or
supplement to the Form S-3 or the prospectus is necessary under applicable
law.

 



 

17.15 The Seller undertakes to provide AMC and any underwriter with all
information regarding the Seller and the intended method of distribution of
the Consideration Shares that is required to be included in the Form S-3 or
the prospectus pursuant to the Securities Act. The Seller undertakes to
promptly notify AMC and any underwriter of any inaccuracies in the information
provided by the Seller that may occur at any time while the Form S-3 remains
effective and shall promptly provide to AMC and any underwriter in writing the
necessary changes to such information required to be disclosed in order to
make the information previously furnished to AMC by the Seller not misleading.

 



 

17.16 If the Form S-3 registers exclusively Consideration Shares, then the
Seller shall be responsible for all legal and other professional fees incurred
by the Seller in connection with the Form S-3, all underwriting commissions
and discounts, all transfer taxes and any other costs and expenses of any
underwriter not borne by the underwriter. If the Form S-3 registers any
securities that are not Consideration Shares, the Seller shall be responsible
for all legal and other professional fees incurred by the Seller in connection
with the Form S-3, all underwriting commissions and discounts relating to
Consideration Shares sold by the Seller thereunder and all transfer taxes
relating to Consideration Shares sold by the Seller thereunder.

 



 

17.17 The Seller undertakes to execute and deliver a reasonable and customary
underwriting agreement in connection with an underwritten offering of the
Consideration Shares and to complete and execute all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, and other documents reasonably required by such
underwriting agreement.

 



 

17.18 If AMC proposes or is required to register any shares of Class A Common
Stock held by Wanda to facilitate Wandas public sale of such shares, AMC
undertakes to give the Seller prompt written notice of its intention to do so.
Upon the written request of the Seller, subject to Schedule 4 and subject to
clause 17.24, made within five (5) Business Days following the receipt of any
such written notice (which request shall specify the maximum number of
Consideration Shares intended to be disposed of by the Seller and the intended
method of distribution thereof), AMC, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Consideration Shares to be
included in the registration statement with the securities that AMC proposes
or is required to register on behalf of Wanda to permit the sale or other
disposition by the

 



      
 

 



 

Seller of the Consideration Shares in accordance with the intended method of
distribution of the Wanda shares of Class A Common Stock to be so registered.
If any requested registration made pursuant to this clause 17.18 involves an
underwritten offering and the underwriters of such offering shall advise AMC
that in their view, the number of securities to be included in such
registration by the Seller and Wanda exceeds the largest number that can be
sold in an orderly manner in such offering, AMC shall use reasonable best
efforts to include in such registration such shares on the basis set out in
clause 17.24.

 



 

17.19 If AMC proposes to register any of its equity securities under the
Securities Act (other than pursuant to (i) registrations on such form or
similar form(s) solely for registration of securities in connection with an
employee benefit plan or dividend reinvestment plan or (ii) the Form S-3) on a
registration statement on Form S-1 or Form S-3 or an equivalent general
registration form then in effect, whether or not for its own account, AMC
undertakes to give the Seller prompt written notice of its intention to do so.
Upon the written request of the Seller, subject to Schedule 4 and subject to
clause 17.25, made within five (5) Business Days following the receipt of any
such written notice (which request shall specify the maximum number of
Consideration Shares intended to be disposed of by the Seller and the intended
method of distribution thereof), AMC, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Consideration Shares to be
included in the registration statement with the securities that AMC proposes
to register to permit the sale or other disposition by the Seller of the
Consideration Shares in accordance with the intended method of distribution by
the Company of the shares of Class A Common Stock to be so registered. If any
requested registration made pursuant to this clause 17.19 involves an
underwritten offering and the underwriters of such offering shall advise AMC
that in their view, the number of securities to be included in such
registration by the Seller and AMC exceeds the largest number that can be sold
in an orderly manner in such offering, AMC shall use reasonable best efforts
to include in such registration such shares on the basis set out in clause
17.24. No registration of Consideration Shares effected under this clause
17.19 shall relieve AMC of its obligations to register Consideration Shares on
Form S-3 pursuant to clause 17.10.

 



 

17.20 If, at any time after giving written notice pursuant to clause 17.18 or
17.19 of its intention to register any equity securities and prior to the
effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such
registration, AMC shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay
registration of such equity securities, AMC undertakes to give the Seller
written notice of such determination and (i) in the case of a determination
not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any
Consideration Shares in connection with such abandoned registration and (ii)
in the case of a determination to delay such registration of its equity
securities, shall be permitted to delay the registration of such Consideration
Shares for the same period as the delay in registering such other equity
securities.

 



 

17.21 The Seller shall have the right to withdraw its request pursuant to
clause 17.18 or 17.19 for inclusion of Consideration Shares in any
registration statement by giving written notice to AMC of its request to
withdraw. Such request must be made in writing prior to the earlier of the
execution of the underwriting agreement or the execution of the custody

 



      
 

 



 

agreement with respect to such registration. Such withdrawal shall be
irrevocable and, after making such withdrawal, the Seller shall no longer have
any right to include Consideration Shares in the registration as to which such
withdrawal was made.

 



 

17.22 The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless AMC and its affiliates from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) caused by or relating to any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement or
prospectus relating to the Consideration Shares, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which
they were made to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon
information furnished in writing to AMC by the Seller expressly for use
therein or caused by or relating to the use of any registration statement or
prospectus if AMC had notified the Seller to discontinue such use or had
previously provided an amended or supplemented prospectus to the Seller and
such amended or supplemented prospectus would have cured the defect giving
rise to such losses.

 



 

17.23 The parties acknowledge and agree that on any offering of shares in AMC
the parties shall have the following appointment rights (provided always that
all such underwriters appointed shall be banks of international repute):

 



 

(a) on an offering by the Seller of its Consideration Shares:

 



 

(i) the Seller shall be entitled to appoint the lead right bookrunner for the
offering; and

 



 

(ii) AMC shall be entitled to propose two (2) candidates to the Seller to act
as lead left bookrunner, and the Seller shall be obliged to select one (1)
such candidate to act as the lead left underwriter for the offering;

 



 

(b) on an offering by AMC in which the Seller participates:

 



 

(i) the Seller shall be entitled to appoint the lead right bookrunner for the
offering; and

 



 

(ii) AMC shall be entitled to appoint the lead left bookrunner for the
offering; and

 



 

(c) on an offering by Wanda in which the Seller seeks to participate, the
Seller shall be entitled to appoint a co-manager.

 



 

17.24 The parties acknowledge and agree that on any offering of AMC shares in
accordance with the provisions of clauses 17.10 to 17.21, the rights to
participate in the offering shall be as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) on an offering by the Seller of its Consideration Shares initiated by the
Seller, AMC shall procure that the Seller shall be entitled to include in such
offering that number of Consideration Shares as it determines in priority to
AMC or Wanda, notwithstanding any other agreement or arrangement AMC may have
with Wanda;

 



 

(b) on an offering by Wanda of its shares, initiated by Wanda, where the
Seller also wishes to sell Consideration Shares in circumstances where the
relevant underwriters determine that there is insufficient market demand to
sell all such shares proposed to be sold, (notwithstanding any other agreement
or arrangement AMC may have with Wanda) AMC shall procure that the shares to
be sold by Wanda and the Seller in the offering shall be sold pro rata
according to the number of shares then held by Wanda and the Seller, provided
that if following such pro rata allocation the shares to be sold by either
Wanda or the Seller are sold in their entirety and there remains any market
demand for more shares to be sold in the offering, the party subject to a cut-
back as a result of such pro rata allocation may fulfill such remaining
demand;

 



 

(c) on an offering initiated by AMC in which Wanda does not seek to
participate, and in which the Seller wishes to participate in circumstances
where the relevant underwriters determine that there is insufficient market
demand for all such shares to be issued and sold, the number of primary shares
to be issued and the number of Consideration Shares to be sold shall be sold
pro rata according to the number of shares proposed to be issued by AMC and
the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Seller, provided that if
following such pro rata allocation the shares to be sold by either AMC or the
Seller are sold in their entirety and there remains any market demand for more
shares to be sold in the offering, the party subject to a cut-back as a result
of such pro rata allocation may fulfill such remaining demand; and

 



 

(d) on an offering initiated by AMC in which both Wanda and the Seller wish to
participate in circumstances where the relevant underwriters determine that
there is insufficient market demand for all such shares to be issued and sold:

 



 

(i) AMC shall be entitled to sell that number of shares it proposed to issue
pursuant to the primary offering; and

 



 

(ii) thereafter, subject to there being sufficient market demand,
notwithstanding any other agreement or arrangement AMC may have with Wanda,
AMC shall procure that Wanda and the Seller shall be entitled to sell that
number of shares pro rata according to the number of shares then held by Wanda
and the Seller, provided that if following such pro rata allocation the shares
to be sold by either Wanda or the Seller are sold in their entirety and there
remains any market demand for more shares to be sold in the offering, the
party subject to a cut-back as a result of such pro rata allocation may
fulfill such remaining demand.

 



      
 

 



 

17.25 AMC acknowledges, agrees and undertakes to the Seller that if AMC
announces any primary offering of equity securities for its own account ninety
(90) days or less prior to the expiry of the First Lock-Up or (as the case may
be) the expiry of the Second Lock-Up, the Seller shall be entitled to exercise
its rights under clauses 17.19 to 17.21 in respect of: (a) if such entitlement
is triggered prior to the First Lock-Up, fifty (50) per cent of the
Consideration Shares; and (b) if such entitlement is triggered after the First
Lock-Up but prior to the Second Lock-Up, one hundred (100) per cent of the
Consideration Shares then held by the Seller, and on terms that, where the
relevant underwriters determine that there is insufficient market demand for
all AMC shares proposed to be issued and included in the offering and all
Consideration Shares proposed to be sold by the Seller and included in the
offering, the number of primary shares to be issued and the number of
Consideration Shares to be sold shall be sold pro rata according to the number
of shares proposed to be issued by AMC and the number of shares proposed to be
sold by the Seller, provided that if following such pro rata allocation the
shares to be sold by either AMC or the Seller are sold in their entirety and
there remains any market demand for more shares to be sold in the offering,
the party subject to a cut-back as a result of such pro rata allocation may
fulfill such remaining demand (and, for the avoidance of doubt, in these
circumstances the Seller shall be released from the lock-up provisions of
Schedule 4 in respect of the applicable number of Consideration Shares). If
the Seller exercises its right to include any Consideration Shares in such
equity offering, the Seller agrees and acknowledges that any other
Consideration Shares held by the Seller which are not subject at the relevant
time to lock-up arrangements pursuant to Schedule 4 and which are not sold
into the offering shall, if so required by the underwriter, be made subject to
lock-up arrangements on terms equivalent (as to duration and scope) to those
terms imposed on each other shareholder participating in such offering,
provided in any event that such lock-up arrangements may not be imposed for a
term greater than one hundred and eighty (180) days. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Seller does not exercise its right to include any Consideration
Shares in such equity offering, the Seller shall not be subject to any
additional lock-up arrangements following completion of such equity offering.

 



 

17.26 The parties acknowledge and agree that if AMC issues equity or stock as
consideration payable to a third party seller in connection with any
acquisition, the Seller shall not be entitled to exercise its rights under
clauses 17.19 to 17.21 or clause 17.25 to sell Consideration Shares as part of
such issue of equity by AMC.

 



 

17.27 AMC and the Seller undertake, where reasonably practicable, to consult
with each other in relation to the proposed exercise of their rights under
this clause 17 and AMC will use reasonable best efforts to seek to ensure that
Wanda consults both AMC and the Seller in connection with the proposed
exercise of its rights under the registration rights agreement dated 23
December 2013, in each case with a view to ensuring an orderly market in AMC
shares and orderly sell downs of AMC shares.

 



 

 **18.** **FURTHER ASSURANCES**

 



 

Each of the parties shall from time to time upon request from any other party
do or procure the doing of all acts and/or execute or procure insofar as each

relying on any pre-contractual statement which is not set out in this
Agreement and/or the other documents referred to in this Agreement, and each
party unconditionally and irrevocably waives any claims, rights or remedies

statement.

 



 

19.3 For the purposes of this clause 19, " **pre-contractual statement** "
means any draft, agreement, undertaking, representation, warranty, promise,
assurance, covenant, indemnity, commitment or arrangement of any nature
whatsoever, whether or not in writing, relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement made or given by any person at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

19.4 It is expressly acknowledged and agreed by each party that:

 



 

(a) no party shall have any claim or remedy in respect of any pre-contractual
statement made by or on behalf of the other party (or any of its
Representatives) in relation to the Proposed Transaction which is not
expressly set out in this Agreement and/or the other documents referred to in
this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any terms or conditions implied by law in any jurisdiction in relation to
the Proposed Transaction are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law
or, if incapable of exclusion, any right or remedies in relation to them are
irrevocably waived; and

 



 

(c) except for any liability in respect of a breach of this Agreement, no
party (or any of its Representatives) shall owe any duty of care or have any

Representatives) in relation to the Proposed Transaction.

 



 

19.5 Nothing in this clause 19 shall limit the liability of any party in the
case of fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment.

21.1 No delay or omission by any party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power or remedy provided by law or under this Agreement shall:

right, power or remedy.

any of the provisions of this Agreement requiring a party to sell, purchase,
make payment, deliver any document or take any action in connection with the
sale and purchase of the shares contemplated hereunder (the " **Share Purchase

performance of the Share Purchase Obligations hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Share Purchase Obligations, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives: (a) any defence in

 **SCHEDULE 4**

 

 ** **

 

 **Lock-Up Arrangements**

 



 

 **Part A**

 



 

 **1.** **Warranties and Covenants**

 



 

The Seller warrants and covenants to AMC as follows:

 



 

(a) the Seller acknowledges that it has conducted an independent investigation
of the financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties, and projected operations of AMC, and in making its determination
to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller has relied on
the results of such investigation and the representations and warranties of
AMC set forth herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller acknowledges
that AMC has not made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as
to the accuracy or completeness of any memoranda, charts, summaries,
presentations, or schedules heretofore made available by AMC to the Seller or
any other information which is not included in this Agreement. The Seller
further acknowledges and agrees that any cost estimates, forecasts,
projections, or other predictions or forward-looking information that may have
been provided to the Seller were prepared for internal planning purposes only
and are not representations or warranties of AMC, and no assurances may be
given that any estimated, forecasted, projected, or predicted results will be
achieved;

 



 

(b) the Seller is not a "U.S. person" as that term is used in Regulation S of
the Securities Act and the Consideration Shares to be received by the Seller
will be acquired for investment for the Sellers own account, not as a nominee
or agent for any unrelated third party, and, except as contemplated by the
Agreement, not with a view to the resale or distribution (as such term is
defined in the Securities Act) of any part thereof to any U.S. person or to
any unrelated third party, and, except as contemplated by the Agreement, the
Seller has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or
otherwise distributing the same to any unrelated third party;

 



 

(c) the Seller understands that the Consideration Shares it is acquiring are
characterized as "restricted securities" under the United States securities
laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from AMC in a transaction not
involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable
regulations such securities may not be resold without registration or an
applicable exemption under the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, except in certain limited circumstances. The Seller understands that the
Consideration Shares will bear all necessary and appropriate legends
reflecting such limitations and acknowledging the resale restrictions of this
Agreement. The Seller warrants that it is familiar with Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, as presently in effect,

 



      
 

 



 

and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby. The Seller agrees that
the Consideration Shares may not be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred or
disposed of except pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities
Act or pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act. The Seller will not
engage in any hedging transactions with respect to AMC common stock except in
compliance with all applicable securities laws; and

 



 

(d) AMC shall not be required and may refuse to register the transfer of any
Consideration Shares not made in accordance with this Agreement and this
Schedule 4.

 



 

 **2.** **Restrictions**

 



 

The Seller agrees with AMC that, except as provided below, it will not
directly or indirectly:

 



 

(a) for a period of six (6) months from Completion, dispose of any of the
Consideration Shares (the " **First Lock-Up** "); and

 



 

(b) for a period of twelve (12) months from Completion, the Seller shall not
dispose of in excess of fifty (50) per cent of the Consideration Shares (the "
**Second Lock-Up** ").

 



 

" **Disposal** " includes (i) any deposit of Consideration Shares into a
voting trust or entering into a voting agreement or providing a proxy (except
pursuant to a solicitation by AMC), consent, or power of attorney with respect
to the Consideration Shares, and (ii) any offer, sale, contract to sell, grant
or sale of options over, purchase of any option or contract to sell, transfer,
charge, pledge, grant of any right or warrant to purchase or otherwise
transfer, lend, or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Consideration
Shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Consideration Shares or the entry into of any swap or other agreement that
transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of Consideration Shares, whether any such transaction described above is to be
settled by delivery of Consideration Shares or such other securities, in cash
or otherwise or any other disposal or agreement to dispose of any
Consideration Shares or any announcement or other publication of the intention
to do any of the foregoing and " **dispos** e" shall be construed accordingly.

 



 

 **3.** **Exceptions**

 



 

3.1 ( **General exceptions** ) The restrictions contained in paragraph 2 shall
not apply to any of the following:

 



 

(a) any Disposal notified in writing in advance to AMC and to which AMC gives
its prior consent in writing in its sole discretion;

 



 

(b) (i) an acceptance of a general or tender offer for AMCs shares; or (ii)
the provision of an irrevocable undertaking to accept such an offer;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) any Disposal pursuant to a transaction approved by the board of directors
of AMC in which all holders of AMC common stock are entitled to participate in
the same manner;

 



 

(d) any Disposal pursuant to any offer by AMC to purchase its own shares which
is made on identical terms to all holders of shares the same class;

 



 

(e) any Disposal of rights to new shares of AMC common stock to be issued by
AMC to all holders of shares of AMC common stock by way of rights issue, in
order to enable the Seller to raise funds through such Disposal to permit a
cashless exercise of the balance of such rights;

 



 

(f) any Disposal of any shares of AMC common stock other than the
Consideration Shares acquired after Completion on the open market and disposed
of in accordance with applicable law;

 



 

(g) any Disposal required by law or by any regulatory authority; and

 



 

(h) any Disposal in accordance with any order made by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



 

3.2 ( **Intra-Group Transfers** ) The restrictions contained in paragraph 2
above shall not prevent any title to or interest in any Consideration Shares
being disposed of by the Seller to its ultimate holding company, fund or
similar entity or any of its subsidiaries or subsidiary undertakings, or to
any subsidiary or subsidiary undertaking of its ultimate holding company, fund
or similar entity provided that:

 



 

(a) such transferee is not a "U.S. person" as such term is used in Regulation
S under the Securities Act and such transfer is otherwise in compliance with
all applicable securities laws;

 



 

(b) prior to the making of any Disposal pursuant to this paragraph 3.2, the
transferee shall have agreed to be bound by the provisions of clauses 17.10 to
17.22 and the restrictions of this Schedule 4 as if it were the transferor, by
the execution and delivery to AMC of a deed of adherence in the form set out
in Part B of this Schedule 4; and

 



 

(c) if any such transferee ceases to be an entity described in this paragraph
3.2, any such interest in any Consideration Shares will, prior to such
cessation, be transferred to either:

 



 

(i) the Seller; or

 



 

(ii) another permitted transferee of the Seller who falls within this
paragraph 3.2 and has executed and delivered to AMC a deed of adherence in the
form set out in Part B of this Schedule 4.

 



      
 

 



 

3.3 ( **Wanda disposals** ) If Wanda disposes of ten (10) per cent. or more of
its aggregate economic interest in AMC stock in the period prior to expiry of
the First Lock-Up, the restriction set out in paragraph 2(a) and paragraph
2(b) above shall cease to apply. If Wanda disposes of ten (10) per cent. or
more of its aggregate economic interest in AMC stock in the period after the
expiry of the First Lock-up and prior to expiry of the Second Lock-Up, the
restriction set out in paragraph 2(b) above shall cease to apply.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Part B 
Deed of Adherence**

 



 

This **Deed of Adherence** is made on [ ** _insert date_** ] by [ ** _insert
name of covenantor_** ] of [ ** _insert address_** ] (the " **Covenantor** ")
in favour of AMC and is supplemental to the provisions of the Share Purchase
Agreement dated [*] July 2016 (the " **SPA** ").

and the Purchasers sole remedy in respect of all and any Claims shall be to
obtain payment from the Management Escrow Account save where an amount has
been released therefrom in circumstances where the Purchaser has failed in
respect of a Notified Claim (as defined in the Share Purchaser Agreement) to
provide a written opinion of Queens Counsel in accordance with the provisions
of clause 3.5 of the Share Purchase Agreement and the Purchaser subsequently
pursues the Notified Claim.

 



 

3.4 Without prejudice to the caps on liability set out at clause 3.3, the
liability of each of the Management Shareholders for and in respect of any
Claim shall be several and shall be limited to and shall not exceed such
Management Shareholders Due Proportion of the Claim. For the purpose of this
clause 3.4, " **Due Proportion** " shall mean, as regards each Management
Shareholder, that proportion set against his name in column (3) of the table
in clause 3.3.

 



 

3.5 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable for any breach of the
Warranties unless a written notice has been sent to the Management
Shareholders giving notice of the relevant facts and setting out the
Purchasers bona fide estimate of the alleged loss and the Warranty or
Warranties which are alleged to have been breached on or before the date which
is twelve (12) months from the Completion Date provided that any Claim which
is validly made shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall no longer be
enforceable on the expiry of nine (9) months from the date of notice of such
Claim unless proceedings in respect of it have been issued and served against
the Management Shareholders prior to the expiry of such period.

 



 

3.6 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable for any Claim if and to
the extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such
Claim is: (a) Disclosed in any Transaction Document or in any of the VDD
Reports or any documents contained in the Data Room, save that (i) for the
purposes of Warranty 8.9 the Digital System Deployment Agreements, and (ii)
for the purposes of Warranty 4.1, the VDD Reports, shall not be deemed to be
Disclosed; or (b) specifically provided for or specifically disclosed in the
Accounts or the Locked-Box Accounts.

 



 

3.7 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable for any Claim to the
extent that it would not have arisen but for, or has been increased as a
result of, any voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) after Completion, by the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group
(or its respective directors or employees or agents or successors in title or
any of its Affiliates) (save that this exclusion shall not apply where such
act, omission or transaction was carried out or effected by the Purchaser or
any member of the Purchaser Group (or its respective directors or employees or
agents or successors in title or any of its Affiliates) pursuant to a legally
binding commitment of the Target Group created on or before Completion or at
the written direction or written request of the Management Shareholders); or

 



 

(b) before Completion, by any member of the Sellers Group or any Target
Company at the written direction or written request or with the written
approval of the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group.

 



 

3.8 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable for any Claim to the
extent that it would not have arisen but for, or has been increased as a
result of, any change in any Applicable Law or any accounting policy of the
Target Group.

 



 

3.9 The Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps as are permitted by
Applicable Law are taken in order to mitigate any Losses which it may suffer
in consequence of any breach by the Management Shareholders of the terms of
this Deed or any fact, matter, event or circumstance likely to give rise to a
Claim.

 



 

3.10 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable in respect of any Claim
to the extent that recovery in respect of such Claim is made under any policy
of insurance of the Target Group.

 



 

3.11 The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of any one
Loss, or in respect of the same circumstances which give rise to more than one
Claim.

 



 

3.12 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable in respect of any Claim
to the extent that the Purchaser is aware as at the date of this Deed of such
a Claim.

 



 

3.13 Each Management Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the Warranties
are given by them to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which (amongst other
things) the Purchaser is:

 



 

(a) purchasing all of the issued share capital of the Company; and

 



 

(b) procuring the full or partial repayment of the Shareholder Loan Amount by
the relevant Target Companies,

 



 

and accordingly damages recoverable by the Purchaser as a result of a breach
of the Warranties will be assessed by reference to the Gross Equity Value
payable by the Purchaser (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, merely by
reference to the Management Consideration).

 



 

3.14 The parties agree that the Purchasers sole right of recovery (if any) in
excess of the cap on liability specified in clause 3.3 in respect of any and
all Claims shall be under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance (save in the case
of fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment) and that in
accordance with the terms of

 



      
 

 



 

the WandI Insurance Policy the attachment point is £5,000,000 such that the
Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover under the WandI Insurance Policy
until Claims exceed £5,000,000.

 



 

3.15 The parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser has secured Warranty
and Indemnity Insurance for the benefit of the Purchaser and/or a member of the
Purchaser Group (the " **Insured Parties** "). So as not to affect the
insurable interest of the Purchaser under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance,
the parties agree that the existence of the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance
shall not affect the liability of the Management Shareholders under this Deed.
However, subject to clause 3.14, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the Management Shareholders shall (save in the case of fraud, fraudulent
misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment) not be required (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) to make a payment by way of discharge of their
liability for any Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Insured Parties
arising as a result of a breach by the Management Shareholders of any of the
Warranties in excess of the amount set out in clause 3.3, whether as a result
of any of the Insured Parties being unable to recover any such losses from the
Warranty and Indemnity Insurers or otherwise.

 



 

3.16 The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any Claim and the Management
Shareholders shall have no liability in connection with the Warranties unless
and until Completion actually occurs.

 



 

3.17 Where any of the Warranties:

 



 

(a) set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 of Schedule 1 (excluding paragraph 18.5 of
Schedule 1) requires it to be established whether any act, omission or other
matter or thing is material (or such other cognate expressions or concepts) in
relation to the Properties or the business carried out at the Properties,
including as to the impact or effect of any such act, omission or other matter
or thing on the title to or use or enjoyment of the Properties or the business
carried out at the Properties, such Warranties shall be construed on the basis
that the materiality of such impact or effect as aforesaid shall be considered
separately in relation to each of:

 



 

(i) any individual Property affected and the business carried out at such
Property alone; and

 



 

(ii) all or any number of the Properties and the businesses carried out at the
Properties;

 



 

(b) other than those set out in paragraphs 3, 4, 8, 9 (excluding 9.10), 12,
13.5, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of Schedule 1, requires it to be established
whether any act, omission or other matter or thing is material, then, in the
absence of any express statement to the contrary, "material" shall mean any
act, omission or other matter or thing that is a liability, a reduction in the
value of an asset, a cost or loss of revenue of £500,000 or more.

 



      
 

 



 

 **4.** **ASSIGNMENT**

 



 

4.1 Except as provided in this clause 4, or unless the parties specifically
agree in writing, no person shall assign, transfer, hold on trust or encumber
all or any of its rights under this Deed nor grant, declare, create or dispose
of any right or interest in any of them. Any purported assignment in
contravention of this clause 4 shall be void.

 



 

4.2 The benefits arising under this Deed may be assigned in whole or in part
by the Purchaser:

 



 

(a) by way of security and/or charge for the benefit of:

 



 

(i) any financial institution or other person lending money or making other
credit facilities available to any member of the Purchaser Group or any Target
Company (including the holders of any debt securities);

 



 

(ii) any counterparty to a derivative transaction entered into by any member
of the Purchaser Group or any Target Company; or

 



 

(iii) any facility or security agent, security trustee, arranger of finance,
receiver or person fulfilling a similar or related role, as security for the
obligations owed by any member of the Purchaser Group or any Target Company to
such person, and any such beneficiary of security may assign all or any of
those rights,

 



 

as security for the obligations owed by any member of the Purchaser Group or
any Target Company to such person, and any such beneficiary of security may
assign all or any of those rights for the purpose of enforcing such security
assignment or charge; or

 



 

(b) to any member of the Purchasers Group (provided always that the Purchaser
shall procure the re-transfer of any benefit so transferred to the Purchaser
if any such member of the Purchasers Group ceases to be a member of the
Purchasers Group).

 



 

4.3 If an assignment is made in accordance with this clause 4, the liabilities
of the Management Shareholders to the Purchaser under this Deed shall be no
greater than such liabilities would have been if the assignment had not
occurred.

 



 

 **5.** **WARRANTY and INDEMNITY INSURANCE**

 



 

5.1 The Purchaser undertakes to ensure that, save in the case of fraud,
fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment by the Management
Shareholders, the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance includes an express and

Insurers may otherwise have against the Management Shareholders, the Seller,
any Related Person of the Management Shareholders or the Seller or any Covered
Person.

 



 

5.2 The Purchaser shall deliver to the Management Shareholders and the Seller
a certified extract of the signed Warranty and Indemnity Insurance evidencing
the terms of such waiver on or before the date of this Deed. This clause 5.2

of the Seller and the Seller shall be entitled to enforce this clause 5.2 as
if the Seller were a party to this Deed.

time.

7.1 Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, each of the parties shall
bear its own costs in connection with this Deed, provided that (save in the
case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation) any costs incurred by any of
the Management Shareholders in connection with this Deed or any Claim made
under this Deed shall be borne by the Target Group and the Purchaser
undertakes (save in the case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation) to each
of the Management Shareholders to procure that the Target Group shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Management Shareholder for any costs incurred
by any of the Management Shareholders in connection with this Deed or any
Claim made under this Deed. The indemnity granted pursuant to this clause 7.1
shall not extend to any matter which is not properly indemnifiable under

its business in the ordinary course.

 



 

16.6 As far as the Management Shareholders are aware, all material information
relating to material non-compliance with any applicable data protection laws

the Management Shareholders would have been liable but for the setting off or

than deferred tax) in the Locked-Box Accounts is overstated, except where that
overstatement arises due to: (a) a change in law; or (b) a change in the

liability of the Company or any Subsidiary to Taxation that is (or but for an
election would have been) the primary liability of, or properly attributable
to, or due from another person (other than a member of the Purchasers Tax
Group); or

 



 

1.4.2 anything that relates to or involves the acquisition or disposal (or
deemed acquisition or disposal) of an asset or the supply of services
(including the lending of money, or the hiring or licensing of tangible or
intangible property) in a transaction that is not, or is deemed to not be,
entered into on arms length terms; or

opposed to actual) profits or to the extent that it gives rise to a Liability

1.5 Unless the contrary intention appears, words and expressions defined in

Agreement, the Management Warranty Deed and this Management Tax Covenant then
the provisions of this Management Tax Covenant shall take precedence.

Covenant are entered into individually by that Management Shareholder on his

other Management Shareholder.

 



 

 **2.** **COVENANT**

 



 

2.1 Subject to the provisions of clauses 4 and 5 of this Management Tax
Covenant, the Management Shareholders covenant to pay to the Purchaser an
amount equal to any:

 



 

2.1.1 Liability for Taxation resulting from, by reference to or in consequence
of any Event occurring on or before Completion or in respect of any gross
receipts, income, profits or gains earned, accrued or received by the Company
or any Subsidiary on or before Completion, whether or not that liability was
discharged on or before Completion;

 



 

2.1.2 subject to clause 4.2 below, Liability for Taxation arising in respect
of or in consequence of an Event occurring, or any income profits or gains
earned, accrued or received at any time and for which the Company or any
Subsidiary is liable as a result of having at any time before Completion been
under the control of any person or associated with any person and that person
or any other person failing to discharge any Liability for Taxation;

 



 

2.1.3 Liability for Taxation arising as a result of a failure to account for
income tax or national insurance contributions in respect of the grant,
exercise, surrender, exchange or other disposal of an option or other right to
acquire securities, or in respect of any acquisition, holding, variation or
disposal of employment-related securities where the acquisition of the
security or the grant of the

 



      
 

 



 

option, or other right to acquire the security, occurred on or before
Completion;

 



 

2.1.4 Liability for Taxation arising under any disguised remuneration rules
which attach to payments or loans made to, any assets made available or
transferred to, or any assets earmarked (however informally) for the benefit
of any employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, or for
the benefit of any associated person, by an employee benefit trust or another
third party where the arrangement giving rise to the charge was entered into
at a time when the third party was acting on the instructions of, or for the
benefit of the Company, the Seller or an associate of either; and

 



 

2.1.5 reasonable costs and reasonable expenses, properly incurred by the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary or any member of the Purchasers Tax
Group in connection with any Liability for Taxation or other liability in
respect of which the Management Shareholders are liable under this Management
Tax Covenant, or successfully taking or defending any action under this
Management Tax Covenant.

 



 

2.2 This Management Tax Covenant, and the liability of the Management
Shareholders to make any payments under or in connection with this Management
Tax Covenant, is conditional in all respects upon Completion occurring under
the Share Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **3.** **PAYMENT DATE AND INTEREST**

 



 

3.1 Payment by the Management Shareholders in respect of any liability under
this Management Tax Covenant must be made in cleared and immediately available
funds on:

 



 

3.1.1 in the case of a Liability for Taxation that involves an actual payment
of or in respect of Taxation, the later of ten (10) Business Days before the
due date for payment and five (5) Business Days after the date on which the
Purchaser serves notice on the Management Shareholders requesting payment; or

 



 

3.1.2 in the case of the loss of a right to repayment of Taxation or a
liability under clause 2.1.5, seven (7) Business Days following the date on
which the Purchaser serves notice on the Management Shareholders requesting
payment; or

 



 

3.1.3 in a case that involves the loss of a Relief (other than a right to
repayment of Taxation), the later of seven (7) Business Days after the date on
which the Purchaser serves notice on the Management Shareholders requesting
payment and the last date on which the Taxation is or would have been required
to be paid to the relevant Taxation Authority in respect of the earlier of:

 



 

(a) the period in which the Loss of the Relief gives rise to an actual
liability to pay Taxation; or

 



      
 

 



 

(b) the period in which the Loss of the Relief occurs (assuming for this
purpose that the Company had sufficient profits or was otherwise in a position
to use the Relief); or

 



 

3.1.4 in a case that falls within (c) of the definition of Liability for
Taxation, the date on which the Taxation saved by the Company or the relevant
Subsidiary is or would have been required to be paid to the relevant Taxation
Authority.

 



 

3.2 If the Liability for Taxation is a liability to corporation tax payable by
instalments under the Corporation Tax (Instalment Payments) Regulations 1998
(SI 1998/3175) (or otherwise):

 



 

3.2.1 the notice served by the Purchaser on the Management Shareholders under
clause 3.1 shall state the amount of the liability due for payment on each
instalment date for the accounting period in which the Liability for Taxation
arises; and

 



 

3.2.2 the due dates for payment of the Taxation in clause 3.1.1 to clause
3.1.4 shall be the due dates for payment of each of the instalments.

 



 

 **4.** **EXCLUSIONS**

 



 

4.1 The covenant contained in clause 2 above shall not cover any Liability for
Taxation to the extent that:

 



 

4.1.1 provision or reserve (other than a provision for deferred tax) for the
liability has been taken into account in preparing, or is made or reflected in
the Locked-Box Accounts; or

 



 

4.1.2 the Liability for Taxation was paid on or before the Locked-Box Date and
the Locked-Box Accounts reflected that payment; or

 



 

4.1.3 it arises as a result of a transaction in the ordinary course of
business of the Company or any Subsidiary between the Locked-Box Date and
Completion; or

 



 

4.1.4 it arises or is increased only as a result of any change in the law or
rates of Taxation coming into force after Completion, or the withdrawal of any
extra-statutory concession previously made by a Taxation Authority (whether or
not the change is retrospective in whole or in part); or

 



 

4.1.5 it would not have arisen but for a change in accounting policies
(including a change in accounting reference date) or the accounting bases on
which the Company or any Subsidiary values its assets after Completion in each
case other than a change made to comply with any applicable generally accepted
accounting standard or legal requirement in force at the date of Completion;
or

 



 

4.1.6 the Purchaser is compensated for the Liability for Taxation under any
provision of the Share Purchase Agreement or the Management Warranty Deed; or

 



      
 

 



 

4.1.7 a Relief that has arisen from the circumstances giving rise to the
relevant Taxation Liability (other than a Purchasers Relief) is available to
the Company or any Subsidiary and such Relief can actually be used to mitigate
the relevant Taxation Liability;

 



 

4.1.8 the Liability for Tax is made good or the Purchaser or the Company is
compensated for it at no expense to the Purchaser or the Company;

 



 

4.1.9 the Liability for Tax arises or is increased because the Purchaser fails
to comply with, or procure the compliance of, the Company and the Subsidiaries
with their obligations under this Management Tax Covenant;

 



 

4.1.10 the Liability for Tax would not have arisen, or would have been reduced
or eliminated, but for a failure or omission, after Completion, by or on
behalf of the Company or the Purchaser to make any valid claim, election,
surrender or disclaimer or to give any notice or consent or to do any other
thing under any enactment or regulation relating to Tax the making, giving or
doing of which was validly taken into account in computing the provision for
Tax in the Locked-Box Accounts or expressly set out within the Disclosure
Letter;

 



 

4.1.11 the Liability for Tax would not have arisen, or would have been reduced
or eliminated, but for any claim, disclaimer or election made after Completion
by the Purchaser or the Company including, without limitation, a disclaimer
of, or a revision to, a claim for capital allowances claimed before Completion
or assumed to be claimed in preparing the Locked-Box Accounts (provided that
such assumption is expressly stated within the Locked Box Accounts or the
Disclosure Letter); or

 



 

4.1.12 it would not have arisen but for a voluntary act, transaction or
omission of the Company or any Subsidiary or the Purchaser or any member of
the Purchasers Tax Group outside the ordinary course of business after
Completion and which the Purchaser was aware, or ought reasonably to have been
aware, would give rise to the Liability for Taxation or other liability in
question **PROVIDED THAT** the following shall not be considered to be
voluntary acts, transactions or omissions of the Purchaser:

 



 

(a) any act carried out pursuant to a legally binding obligation entered into
by any member of the Target Group on or before Completion (including pursuant
to this Management Tax Covenant or the Share Purchase Agreement) or required
to be taken by the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of this Management Tax
Covenant, the Share Purchase Agreement or the Management Warranty Deed; or

 



 

(b) an act which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is required to make by
any legislation (whether related to Tax or otherwise); or

 



 

(c) any disclosure required by law to a Tax Authority or other government,
state, municipal, local or federal regulatory authority; or

 



 

(d) the payment of stamp duty on any document, or the bringing into any
jurisdiction of any document, entered into on or prior to Completion

 



      
 

 



 

which is required in order for it to be produced as evidence in court or to
prove or obtain registration of the title of the Company to any asset owned on
Completion.

 



 

4.2 The covenant given in clause 2.1.2 shall not cover any Liability for
Taxation to the extent that such Liability for Taxation arises in respect of a
Subsidiary that has not been incorporated in, and is not tax resident in, the
United Kingdom.

 



 

 **5.** **LIMITATIONS**

 



 

5.1 The Management Shareholders shall be liable for any claim under clause 2
for a period of twelve (12) months from the Completion Date.

 



 

5.2 The provisions of clauses 3.1, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.16 of the Management
Warranty Deed shall apply to limit the liability of the Management
Shareholders under this Management Tax Covenant mutatis mutandis as if set out
in full in this Management Tax Covenant.

 



 

5.3 Save in the event of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, the aggregate
liability of each Management Shareholder in respect of any and all claims
under this Management Tax Covenant shall not exceed an amount equal to £1.00.

 



 

5.4 The Management Shareholders shall not be liable for any claim under clause
2 to the extent that such claim relates to an Excluded Tax Liability.

 



 

 **6.** **OVERPROVISIONS**

 



 

6.1 If, on or before the date falling twelve (12) months from the Completion
Date, the Management Shareholders believe that there is an Overprovision, the
Management Shareholders shall notify the Purchaser and if the auditors for the
time being of the Company or any Subsidiary determine (at the request and
expense of the Management Shareholders) that there is an Overprovision, then:

 



 

6.1.1 the amount of any Overprovision shall first be set off against any
payment then due from the Management Shareholders under this Management Tax
Covenant;

 



 

6.1.2 to the extent that there is an excess, a refund shall be made to the
Management Shareholders of any previous payment or payments made by the
Management Shareholders under this Management Tax Covenant or in respect of a
breach of any of the Tax Warranties (and not previously refunded under this
Management Tax Covenant) up to the amount of that excess; and

 



 

6.1.3 to the extent that the excess referred to in clause 6.1.1 is not
exhausted, the remainder of that excess will be carried forward and set off
against any future payment or payments that become due from the Management
Shareholders under this Management Tax Covenant or for breach of the Tax
Warranties.

 



 

6.2 After the Companys or the Subsidiaries auditors have made a
determination under clause 6.1, the Management Shareholders or the Purchaser
may, at any time on or before the date falling twelve (12) months from the
Completion Date, request the auditors for the time being of the Company or the
relevant Subsidiary to review and,

 



       
 

 



 

if necessary and as appropriate, amend the original determination (at the
expense of the party requesting the review, or where a payment becomes due
under this clause 6.2, at the expense of the party required to make that
payment) and an adjusting payment equal to the amount of any disparity between
the original and revised determinations shall be made by or to the Management
Shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



 

 **7.** **SAVINGS**

 



 

7.1 If, on or before the date falling twelve (12) months from the Completion
Date, the Management Shareholders, having made a payment to the Purchaser
under this Management Tax Covenant, believe that a Saving has arisen, the
Management Shareholders shall inform the Purchaser and if the Companys or
Subsidiarys auditors for the time being determine (at the request and expense
of the Management Shareholders) that a Saving has arisen, the Purchaser shall,
as soon as reasonably practicable, repay to the Management Shareholders, after
deduction of any amounts then due by the Management Shareholders, the lesser
of:

 



 

7.1.1 the amount of the Saving (as determined by the auditors) less any costs
incurred by the Purchaser, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary; and

 



 

7.1.2 the amount paid by the Management Shareholders under clause 2 for the
Liability for Taxation which gave rise to the Saving less any part of that
amount previously repaid to the Management Shareholders under any provision of
this Management Tax Covenant, for breach of the Tax Warranties or otherwise.

 



 

7.2 After the Companys or Subsidiarys auditors have made a determination
under clause 7.1, the Management Shareholders or the Purchaser may, at any
time on or before the date falling twelve (12) months from the Completion
Date, request the auditors for the time being of the Company or the relevant
Subsidiary to review and, if necessary and as appropriate, amend the original
determination (at the expense of the party requesting the review, or where a
payment becomes due under this clause 7.2, at the expense of the party
required to make that payment) and an adjusting payment equal to the amount of
any disparity between the original and revised determinations shall be made by
or to the Management Shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



 

 **8.** **RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTIES**

 



 

8.1 Where the Management Shareholders have paid an amount under clause 2 for
any Liability for Taxation and the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary
is, or becomes, entitled to recover from some other person that is not the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary or any other company in the
Purchasers Tax Group or any Excluded Person, any amount for any Liability for
Taxation, the Purchaser shall or shall procure that the Company or the
relevant Subsidiary shall:

 



 

8.1.1 notify the Management Shareholders of their entitlement as soon as
reasonably practicable; and

 



 

8.1.2 if required by the Management Shareholders and, subject to the Purchaser
and the Company being indemnified by the Management Shareholders against any

 



      
 

 



 

Taxation that may be suffered on receipt of that amount and any costs and
expenses incurred in recovering that amount, take, or procure that the Company
or the relevant Subsidiary takes, all reasonable steps to enforce that
recovery against the person in question (keeping the Management Shareholders
fully informed of the progress of any action taken).

 



 

8.2 No member of the Purchasers Tax Group shall be obliged under this clause
8 to take any steps requested by the Management Shareholders which it
reasonably considers would materially prejudice the commercial or Tax position
of any member of the Purchasers Tax Group.

 



 

8.3 If the Purchaser, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary recovers any
amount referred to in clause 8.1, the Purchaser shall account to the
Management Shareholders for the lesser of:

 



 

8.3.1 any amount recovered (including any related interest or related
repayment supplement) less any Taxation suffered in respect of that amount and
any costs and expenses incurred in recovering that amount (except to the
extent that amount has already been made good by the Management Shareholders
under clause 8.1.2); and

 



 

8.3.2 the amount paid by the Management Shareholders under clause 2 in respect
of the Liability for Taxation in question.

 



 

8.4 For the avoidance of doubt, where the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance
allows or permits the insurer to give the Purchaser instructions relating to
any third party recovery and such instructions conflict with those of the
Management Sellers, the insurers instructions shall prevail and acting in
accordance with those instructions shall not be a voluntary act for the
purposes of clause 4.1.12.

 



 

 **9.** **CORPORATION TAX RETURNS**

 



 

9.1 Subject to this clause 9, the Purchaser will have exclusive conduct of all
Taxation affairs of the Company and the Subsidiaries after Completion.

 



 

9.2 The Purchaser or their duly authorised agent shall prepare the Tax
Returns, and shall have conduct of all matters (including correspondence)
relating to the Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries for all
accounting periods commencing on or before Completion, to the extent that the
same have not been prepared and filed before Completion, and submit them to
the Management Shareholders.

 



 

9.3 All documents prepared under clause 9.2 shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices and without a change of any accounting method
(except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or generally
accepted accounting standards) and providing the Time Limit falls at least 3
months after Completion must be submitted in draft form by the Purchaser to
the Management Shareholders or their duly authorised agents at least 10
Business Days before any Time Limit. The Purchaser shall incorporate all
reasonable comments and suggested amendments made by the Management
Shareholders or its duly authorised agents providing such comments are
received at least 5 Business Days before the Time Limit.

 



      
 

 



 

9.4 The Purchaser shall procure that the Company and the Subsidiaries provide
such access to their books, accounts and records as is necessary and
reasonable to enable the Management Shareholders or their duly authorised
agent to review the Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries for all
accounting periods commencing on or before Completion and conduct matters
relating to them in accordance with this clause 9.

 



 

9.5 The Management Shareholders shall provide the Purchaser and the Company
with all reasonable assistance, co-operation and information requested in
connection with Tax Returns outstanding at Completion and in connection with
all negotiations, correspondence and agreements relating to the Companys Tax
affairs for accounting periods commencing before Completion.

 



 

9.6 For the avoidance of doubt the provisions of this clause 9 shall not
prejudice the rights of the Purchaser to make a claim under this Management
Tax Covenant for any Liability for Taxation and shall not fetter the ability
of any member of the Purchasers Tax Group to take any action in relation to a
Liability for Taxation.

 



 

9.7 For the avoidance of doubt, where the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance
allows or permits the insurer to give the Purchaser instructions relating to
document that would fall within this clause 9, and such instructions conflict
with those of the Management Sellers, the insurers instructions shall prevail
and acting in accordance with those instructions shall not be a voluntary act
for the purposes of clause 4.1.12.

 



 

 **10.** **PURCHASER S COVENANT**

 



 

10.1 The Purchaser shall pay to the Seller or the Management Shareholders an
amount equal to any tax liability which is assessed on the Seller or the
Management Shareholders (respectively) and relating to any of the following
Events occurring or deemed to occur after Completion:

 



 

10.1.1 the Company, a Subsidiary or any member of the Purchasers Tax Group
failing to pay any Tax to which it is liable and for which the Purchaser would
not have been entitled to make a claim against the Management Shareholders
under clause 2 (ignoring for these purposes the limitations contained within
clause 5) if the Company, a Subsidiary or the relevant member of the
Purchasers Tax Group had paid that liability;

 



 

10.1.2 any Taxation (whether before, on or after Completion) for which the
Seller or the Management Shareholders or any director or former director of
any member of the Sellers Group (other than a person who was a director of
the Company after Completion) is or becomes liable as a result of any member
of the Purchasers Tax Group failing to discharge Tax properly assessed upon
it; or

 



 

10.1.3 the Company, a Subsidiary or any member of the Purchasers Tax Group
ceasing to be resident in its jurisdiction of incorporation for Tax purposes,

 



 

 **PROVIDED THAT** in each case the Management Shareholders or the Seller have
not recovered such tax liability under any relevant statutory provisions or
from any third party.

 



      
 

 



 

10.2 Any payment made by the Purchaser under clause 10.1 shall be made five
(5) days before the last day on which the relevant payment of Tax is due to be
made to the relevant Tax Authority without incurring any liability to interest
or penalties.

 



 

10.3 The Purchaser shall pay the Seller and the Management Shareholders an
amount equal to all costs and expenses reasonably and properly incurred by the
Seller and the Management Shareholders in connection with any action taken
under this clause 10.

 



 

10.4 If the Purchaser makes a payment under this clause 10, the Management
Shareholders and the Seller agree:

 



 

10.4.1 to discharge, or procure the discharge of, the tax liability in
question promptly; and

 



 

10.4.2 not to enforce any statutory right of recovery against any member of
the Purchasers Tax Group in respect of the liability in question.

 



 

 **11.** **GROSSING UP**

 



 

11.1 All amounts due under this Management Tax Covenant shall be paid by the
Management Shareholders to the Purchaser in full, without any set-off,
counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or
withholding of tax required by law). If any deductions or withholdings are
required by law to be made from any of the sums payable under this Management
Tax Covenant, the Management Shareholders shall pay to the Purchaser such sum
as will, after the deduction or withholding is made, leave the Purchaser with
the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive without that
deduction or withholding.

 



 

11.2 If any sum payable by the Management Shareholders to the Purchaser under
the Management Tax Covenant is subject to Taxation in the hands of the
Purchaser, the Management Shareholders shall pay any additional amount
required to ensure that the net amount received by the Purchaser shall be the
amount that the Purchaser would have received if the payment was not subject
to Taxation.

 



 

11.3 If the Purchaser assigns the benefit of this Management Tax Covenant or
the Share Purchase Agreement, the Management Shareholders shall not be liable
under this clause 11, except to the extent that the Management Shareholders
would have been so liable had no assignment occurred.

 



 

 **12.** **GENERAL**

 



 

12.1 All payments made by the Management Shareholders to the Purchaser or by
the Purchaser to the Management Shareholders in accordance with this
Management Tax Covenant will be treated, to the extent possible, as an
adjustment to the Management Consideration.

 



 

12.2 The Purchaser shall in its absolute discretion decide whether to make a
claim under this Management Tax Covenant or the Tax Warranties or both.

 



 

12.3 The provisions of clauses 6 to 15 of the Management Warranty Deed shall
apply to this Management Tax Covenant mutatis mutandis.

 



      
 

 



 

 **13.** **THIRD PARTY RIGHTS**

 



 

13.1 Except as expressly provided in clause 10, a person who is not a party to
this agreement shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Management Tax Covenant.

 



 

13.2 The rights of the parties to terminate, rescind or agree any variation,
waiver or settlement under this Management Tax Covenant are subject to the
consent of the Seller.
