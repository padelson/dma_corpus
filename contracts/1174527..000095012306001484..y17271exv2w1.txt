pertaining to such shares of Spinco Common Stock.   (e) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the
Exchange Agent that remains undistributed 180 days after the Effective
Time    20   shall be delivered to Company, and any holders of shares of
Spinco Common Stock as of the Record Date shall thereafter look only to
Company for payment of the applicable number of shares of Company Common
Stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Company Common
Stock.   (f) No Liability. None of TWDC, Company, Spinco, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder
of shares of Spinco Common Stock for any shares of Company Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.   (g) Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent, on behalf of
Company and/or Spinco, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
any Spinco Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Spinco Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.   Section 3.3 Employee Stock Options and Other
Equity Awards.   (a) Company Stock Options.   (i) If Company elects to
adjust the Company Options held by Company Employees under the Company Equity
Plan or otherwise in each case pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms
thereof, to reflect the effects of the Special Dividend, Company shall, at or
prior to the Effective Time, make such adjustments to each such Company
Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in the manner set forth on Section 3.3(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such adjustments shall
be effected in a manner so as to not be deemed a modification under Sections
409A and 424(a) of the Code.   (ii) Between the Spinco Funding Date and the
Effective Time, Company shall not recognize any attempted exercise of Company
Options, shall not issue any shares of Company Common Stock upon the exercise
of Company Options and shall instruct the transfer agent for shares of
Company Common Stock not to issue any shares of Company Common Stock upon any
attempted exercise of Company Options. Any such attempted exercise shall be
null and void and have no effect, and the holder thereof may only validly
elect to exercise such Company Option after the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, the holder of any Company Option that has attempted to
exercise such Company Option between the Spinco Funding Date and the
Effective Time shall not be entitled to (i) any dividend paid with respect to
the underlying stock or (ii) vote such underlying stock unless and until such
holder validly exercises the Company Options after the Effective Time.   
21    (b) TWDC Stock Options and Other Equity Awards.   (i) At or prior
to the Effective Time, TWDC and Company shall take all action necessary such
that each option to acquire shares of TWDC Common Stock (each, a "TWDC
Option") held by a Business Employee under a TWDC Equity Plan, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Company as of the Effective Time; provided that TWDC or
Spinco shall have obtained the agreement of the Business Employee who is the
holder of the applicable TWDC Option to the foregoing assumption and the
conversion set forth in this Section 3.3(b)(i). Accordingly, each such
TWDC Option will cease to represent a right to acquire shares of TWDC Common
Stock and shall be converted into an option (a "TWDC Converted Option") to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock. The number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each TWDC Converted Option shall be equal to the
product of the number of shares of TWDC Common Stock subject to such TWDC
Option multiplied by the Option Ratio; provided that any fractional shares of
Company Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to each TWDC Converted Option shall equal the quotient of the
exercise price per share of TWDC Common Stock under the corresponding TWDC
Option divided by the Option Ratio; provided that such exercise price shall
be rounded to the nearest whole cent. Each such TWDC Converted Option will
otherwise have substantially the same terms and conditions as the
corresponding TWDC Option, including vesting and term of exercise, except
that references to TWDC will be changed to refer to Company and references to
any of the TWDC Equity Plans will be changed to refer to an applicable
benefit plan of Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the conversion of options under this Section 3.3(b)(i) shall be
made in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code,
and, if applicable, Section 424(a) of the Code. Any Business Employee who is
a holder of a TWDC Option who does not agree to the conversion contemplated
by this Section 3.3(b)(i) will be treated under the terms of the applicable
TWDC Equity Plan as having terminated his or her employment or other service
arrangement with TWDC and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and will have
such rights, as applicable, under the original terms of the TWDC Option as in
effect at the time of effective termination.   (ii) Each award of restricted
stock units held by a Business Employee under a TWDC Equity Plan and subject
to a restricted stock unit award that is outstanding at the Effective Time (a
"TWDC RSU") shall be assumed by Company as of the Effective Time; provided
that TWDC or Spinco have obtained the agreement of the Business Employee who
is the holder of the applicable TWDC RSU to the foregoing assumption and
conversion set forth in this Section 3.3(b)(ii). Accordingly, each such TWDC
RSU will be converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock (a "TWDC Converted RSU"). The number of units
subject to a TWDC Converted RSU shall be equal to the product of the number
of units subject to the TWDC RSU multiplied by the Option Ratio. Each such
TWDC Converted RSU will otherwise have substantially the same terms and
conditions as the corresponding TWDC RSU, except that (A) references to TWDC
will be changed to refer to Company and references to any of the TWDC Equity
Plans will be changed to refer to an applicable plan of Company and (B) any
performance vesting provisions will be adjusted, in the sole discretion
of TWDC so that the vesting of the TWDC Converted RSU is based upon
performance requirements relating to Company that are comparable to the
original performance    22   requirements of the TWDC RSU.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of
TWDC RSUs under this Section 3.3(b)(ii) shall be made in a manner that is
intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.   (c) Following the
Effective Time, Company shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of the TWDC Converted Options in accordance with this
Section 3.3. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Company
shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the TWDC Converted Options and the
TWDC Converted RSUs and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement on Form S-8 (and maintain
current the status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as the
TWDC Converted Options and the TWDC Converted RSUs remain outstanding.  
Section 3.4 Company Special Dividend. Prior to the Closing, Company shall set
a record date (which shall be no earlier than two trading days prior to the
Closing Date) for and declare, and immediately prior to the Closing, Company
shall pay the Special Dividend. Company acknowledges and agrees that
in connection with the Special Dividend and any regular dividends between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, pursuant to and in accordance
with the last paragraph of Section 11.08 of that certain Indenture, dated as
of February 18, 2004, relating to the Company Convertible Notes, by and
between Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee, no adjustment shall be
made to the conversion price of the Company Convertible Notes. Company agrees
that in the event of a repurchase of the Company Convertible Notes, any offer
to purchase shall expire or otherwise be terminated prior to the commencement
of an exchange offer by TWDC in respect of a split-off.   ARTICLE IV

24   defaults, rights of payment and reimbursement, terminations,

on the date of such filing), all reports, prospectuses, forms, schedules,
registration statements, proxy statements or information statements required

Spinco Subsidiaries will have good, valid and marketable title to, or in the
case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of
the tangible Business Assets except where the failure to have such good,
valid and marketable title or valid leasehold interests would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the Spinco Entities taken as a whole, in each case subject to no
Encumbrances, except for (i) Encumbrances reflected in the Spinco Audited
Financial Statements, (ii) Encumbrances consisting of zoning or planning
restrictions, easements, permits and other restrictions or limitations on the

studios and main transmitter sites of the Business. All buildings, structures
and improvements located on such material real property are in reasonably
good condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, except where the

impair the use of such material real property as currently used by the
Business.   Section 4.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.   (a)

Ancillary Agreements, (ii) as set forth in the Spinco Audited Financial

Adverse Effect.    28    (b) There is no Order against TWDC, any of

Entities are in compliance, in all material respects, with all Laws and

normal course upon timely filing a complete and properly executed application
for renewal and payment of all applicable filing fees;   (g) There is not
pending or, to TWDC\'s Knowledge, there is not threatened, any action or

(j) To TWDC\'s Knowledge, there are no facts, conditions or events relating

impose any materially adverse condition in connection with approval of the
transfer of control of the Subsidiaries of TWDC holding the TWDC FCC Licenses
to Spinco (as applicable), Company or the Surviving Corporation (other than
conditions imposed as a result of rulemakings affecting the radio
broadcasting industry generally); and   (k) Except as set forth in Section

There are no past or present actions, activities, circumstances, events or
incidents with respect to any of the Spinco Entities (including to TWDC\'s
Knowledge any offsite disposal of, or exposure to, any Hazardous Materials)

applicable Environmental Laws.   (f) TWDC has made available to Company all
Phase I environmental reports and other environmental assessment reports or

taken by Company and Spinco that do not constitute a Restructuring Tainting
Act (as defined in the   61  Tax Sharing Agreement) and (ii) of Company
and Spinco that shall be prohibited during the Restricted Period (as defined
in the Tax Sharing Agreement).   (d) Prior to the filing of the Ruling
Request, TWDC and Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
from each of Farid Suleman and Forstmann Little and Co. a representation letter
reasonably acceptable to their respective counsel relating to certain matters
under Section 355(e) of the Code, such representations to be repeated when
appropriate prior to the Effective Time.   Section 6.6 Cooperation. The
Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to, together or pursuant to the
allocation of responsibility set forth below or otherwise to be agreed upon
between them take, or cause to be taken, the following actions:   (a) NYSE
and Other Listings. Company shall prepare and file, and shall use reasonable
efforts to have approved prior to the Effective Time, an application for the
listing on the NYSE of the Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger and shares of Company Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance pursuant to any director or employee benefit plan or arrangement,
subject to official notice of issuance prior to the Closing Date.   (b)
Blue Sky Filings. Company shall take all such action as may be required under
state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.   (c) Further Assistance.
The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to provide such further
assistance as any of the other Parties may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing and with carrying out the purpose of this Agreement.  
(d) Cooperation of Third Parties. Where the cooperation of any third parties,
such as insurers or trustees, would be necessary in order for any Party to
completely fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, such Party will use its reasonable efforts to seek the
cooperation of such third parties.   Section 6.7. Employee Matters.   (a)
As of the Effective Time, the Business Employees shall cease to be employees
of TWDC or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) and shall become or continue to
be employees of Spinco or its Subsidiaries without any interruption in
employment, and Spinco or its Subsidiaries shall be the sole employer of
the Business Employees at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Spinco
and its Subsidiaries shall not employ any individuals other than the Business
Employees. The Business Employees (including Business Employees covered by
collective bargaining agreements) shall be entitled to all compensation or
benefits accrued and payable under each Business Benefit Plan other than a
Spinco Benefit Plan (excluding any Business Benefit Plan providing severance
or termination pay) immediately prior to the Effective Date, which shall be
paid by TWDC in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Business
Benefit Plans as if such Business employee terminated employment with the
sponsor of or participating employer in such Business Benefit Plan at the
Effective Time. With respect to each of the collective bargaining agreements
that currently cover one or more Business Employees, the Company agrees to
take all actions necessary so that, effective at the Effective  
62  Time, Spinco shall assume and be bound by such agreements with respect
to the applicable Business Employees, or shall enter into substantially
identical collective bargaining agreements with respect to the applicable
Business Employees, in each case such that, among other things, Spinco shall
assume and be bound by the obligations under such agreements to provide
employee benefits to the applicable Business Employees in accordance with the
terms thereof. The Company acknowledges that it shall have a duty to bargain,
pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act, with any and all labor
organizations certified or recognized as the bargaining representative for
any Business Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TWDC shall retain all
liabilities under the current terms of the collective bargaining agreements
(i) relating to Business Benefit Plans for collectively bargained Business
Employees to the extent provided in Section 6.7(b) of this Agreement, (ii)
for all retiree welfare benefit obligations (other than those for which
Business Employees may meet the eligibility requirements following the
Effective Time and for which Business Employees are intended to pay the
entire cost of coverage), and (iii) for all retiree welfare benefit
obligations under which former employees under such collective bargaining
agreements are currently receiving benefits or are eligible to receive
benefits.   (b) Except for the Spinco Benefit Plans, any Business Material
Contract with any Business Employee and any other agreement with on-air
talent or employees providing services to the Business, (i) Spinco shall not
establish, maintain or assume any Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time, and
(ii) Spinco shall not assume or be deemed to assume any liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) or obligations related to or with respect to any
Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time. TWDC or its ERISA Affiliates shall not
assume any Company Benefit Plan, nor shall they assume or be deemed to assume
any liabilities (contingent or otherwise) or obligations related to or with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan,
policy or arrangement of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, regardless of
when such liabilities or obligations may be incurred, reported or
assessed.   (c) Except as required pursuant to any collective bargaining
agreements, for a period of at least two years following the Effective Time,
Company shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries or Spinco to provide, to
Business Employees (i) at least the same bonus opportunity (substantially
consistent with past practice) and base wages and salaries as was provided by
TWDC or its Subsidiaries to Business Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits and fringe benefits under plans,
programs and arrangements (other than equity-based plans) that are at least
as favorable as the employee benefits and fringe benefits provided by Company
to similarly situated employees of Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
for a period of two years following the Effective Time, Company shall
provide, or cause its Subsidiaries or Spinco to provide, except as required
pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement entered into following the
Effective Time, to the extent that the Business Employees participate in any
such collective bargaining agreement, to all Business Employees who remain
employed following the Effective Time, medical, dental, vision, life
insurance and disability benefits and company automobiles in accordance with
the terms set forth on Section 6.7(c) of the TWDC/Spinco Disclosure
Schedule.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.7(c) to the contrary
and except as provided under any collective bargaining agreements, at and for
a period of at least two years following the Effective Time, Company shall
cause the Business Employees to be eligible for   63  coverage under a
severance or separation pay benefits plan that is at least as favorable as
the severance or separation pay benefits plan provided by TWDC or its
Subsidiaries to such Business Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, without limiting Section 6.7(d) hereof, with (i) any
service prior to the Effective Time with TWDC or its Subsidiaries previously
credited to Business Employees for such purpose to be credited under the
severance or separation pay benefits plan of Spinco and (ii) eligibility for
benefits under such Spinco plan to include employees who are constructively
terminated as a result of a non de minimus reduction in position, title (for
Vice Presidents or above), overall responsibilities, level of authority,
level of reporting (for Vice Presidents or above), base compensation, annual
incentive compensation opportunity, aggregate employee benefits to the extent
inconsistent with Section 6.7(c) hereof, or a request that the participant\'s
location of employment be relocated by more than fifty (50) miles.   (e) To
the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or vesting
(other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan) under any Company
Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit or fringe benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Company, Spinco or
their Subsidiaries after the Effective Time for the benefit of Business
Employees, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit Business Employees
for service on or prior to the Effective Time with TWDC or its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, to the same extent credited for such purposes under the
comparable plan, program or arrangement immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, Company shall cause each "employee
welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) covering Business
Employees (i) to reduce each such eligible employee\'s (and his or her
eligible dependents) annual deductible limits under such plans for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs to the extent deductible expenses
were incurred and recognized for comparable purposes under the comparable
Business Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to
the extent waived under the Business Benefit Plans, to waive any pre-existing
condition limitations or exclusions that do not apply to such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (f) On or prior to the Closing
Date, TWDC shall deliver to Company a list setting forth (i) the names of all
of the Business Employees, (ii) the date of employment and title or job
position of each such Business Employee, and (iii) the total annual salary,
wages, bonus or other compensation of each such Business Employee. In
addition, on or prior to the Closing Date, TWDC shall deliver to the Company
information relating to the expenses incurred by the Business Employees that
count against annual deductible limits and co-payments limits of the
"employee welfare plans" covering Business Employees.   (g) Following the
date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable notice, and subject to
collective bargaining agreements and applicable Law in the case of union
employees, TWDC shall make available to Company all Business Employees
for the purpose of interviewing during normal business hours; provided that
such interviews shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the operations
of the Business or the operations of TWDC or any of its Subsidiaries. TWDC
shall furnish to Company such employee information and records as Company
may reasonably request.   64   Section 6.8 Competition Approvals; FCC
Approvals; IRS Rulings.   (a) Competition Approvals. (i) The Parties shall,
as promptly as practicable, make their respective filings and any other
required or requested submissions under the HSR Act, promptly respond to any
requests for additional information from the FTC or the DOJ, and cooperate in
the preparation of, and coordinate, such filings, submissions and responses
(including the exchange of drafts between each Party\'s outside counsel) so
as to reduce the length of any review periods and (ii) subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable Laws and regulations
to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including providing
information and using their reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
exemptions, rulings, consents, authorizations, approvals and waivers to
effect all necessary registrations and filings and to lift any injunction or
other legal bar to the Transactions, as promptly as practicable, and to take
all other actions necessary to consummate the Transactions contemplated
hereby in a manner consistent with applicable Law, it being understood that
this Section 6.8(a) does not address any filings required under the
Communications Act or the IRS Rulings (which are addressed in Section
6.8(b) and Section 6.8(d), respectively). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, TWDC, Company and Spinco agree, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective
reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances (other than the FCC
Consent) required to consummate the Merger (including through compliance with
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign government reporting requirements), to
respond to any government requests (other than by the FCC) for information,
and to contest and resist any Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any Order (other than the FCC Consent), that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Transactions, including by
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all
available legislative action. The Parties will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade Law, and will provide one
another with copies of all material communications from and filings with, any
Governmental Authorities (other than the FCC) in connection with the
Transactions contemplated hereby. Any filing fees required to be paid by the
Parties under the HSR Act shall be borne one-half by Spinco and one-half by
Company.   (b) FCC Approvals.   (i) As promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement (but in no event later than 15 Business Days following
the date of this Agreement), the Parties shall file with the FCC the
applications requesting FCC consent to transfer of control of (A) the
Subsidiaries of TWDC or Spinco holding the TWDC FCC Licenses and (B) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holding Company FCC Licenses ("FCC
Applications"). The Parties shall diligently take, or cooperate in the taking
of, all necessary, desirable and proper actions, provide any additional
information reasonably required or requested by the FCC, and otherwise use
their reasonable efforts to obtain promptly the requested consent and
approval of the applications by the FCC;   65   (ii) Each Party will keep
the other informed of any material communication (including any meeting,
conference or telephonic call), and will provide the other copies of all
correspondence between it (or its advisors) and the FCC, and each Party will
permit the other Parties to review any material communication relating to the
FCC Applications to be given by it to the FCC. Each Party shall notify the
other Parties hereto in the event it becomes aware of any other facts,
actions, communications, or occurrences that might directly or indirectly
affect the Parties\' intent or ability to effect prompt FCC approval of the
FCC Applications. The Parties will jointly be responsible for the process of
dealing with the FCC with respect to the Transactions, including the timing
(subject to the express limitations on timing set forth in this Section
6.8(b)), negotiation and determination of any actions proposed to be taken by
the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries. The Parties shall oppose any
petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the
FCC Applications and any requests for reconsideration or judicial review of
the FCC Consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.8(b), no
Party will be required to take any action under this Section 6.8(b) that is
inconsistent with applicable Law. The fees required by the FCC for the filing
of the FCC Applications shall be borne one-half by Spinco and one-half by
Company;   (iii) In order to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of
the FCC Applications, the Parties agree, as part of the FCC Applications, to
request that the FCC apply its policy permitting license transfers in
transactions involving multiple markets to proceed, notwithstanding the
pendency of one or more license renewal applications. The Parties agree to
make such representations and undertakings as necessary or appropriate to
invoke such policy, including undertakings to assume the position of
applicant with respect to any pending license renewal applications, and to
assume the risks relating to such applications. Each of the Parties agree not
to, and shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any
action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay, materially
impede or prevent receipt of the FCC Consent; and   (iv) The Parties
acknowledge that license renewal applications may be pending before the FCC
with respect to the TWDC FCC Licenses and the Company FCC Licenses (each such
station the license for which is subject to a renewal application, a "Renewal
Station" and each such pending license renewal application a "Renewal
Application"). To the extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant of a
Renewal Application, and thereby facilitate grant of the FCC Applications,
the Parties shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC
with respect to the relevant Renewal Application, to extend, for a period of
up to three years following the date of renewal, the statute of limitations
for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Renewal
Station in connection with any pending complaints that such Renewal Station
aired programming that contained obscene, indecent, or profane material (a
"Tolling Agreement"). The Parties shall consult in good faith with each
other prior to entering any such Tolling Agreement.   (c) Required Actions.
Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section
6.8, the Company shall proffer to (A) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of such assets, categories of
assets or businesses of Company, its Subsidiaries, any of the Spinco Entities
or the Business, and (B) terminate such existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations of Company, its Subsidiaries, any of the
Spinco Entities or the Business (and, in each case, to enter into  
66  agreements with the FCC, the FTC or the DOJ, as the case may be, giving
effect thereto) in each case with respect to the foregoing clauses (A) or
(B), if such action is necessary or reasonably advisable for the purpose of
promptly obtaining the FCC\'s, the FTC\'s or the DOJ\'s approval of the
Transactions, as the case may be.   (d) IRS Rulings and Opinions.   (i)
TWDC and Spinco shall use their reasonable best efforts to seek, as promptly
as practicable, one or more private letter rulings from the IRS, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to TWDC (the "IRS Rulings"), and one or
more Opinions of Counsel, to the effect that (x) the transactions
that comprise the Restructuring shall qualify as nonrecognition transactions
under Section 332, 351, 355, 361 or 368 of the Code, (y) the Distribution
shall qualify as a nonrecognition transaction to TWDC and its stockholders
under Section 355(a) of the Code, and (z) the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. The IRS Rulings and Opinions of
Counsel may be based upon customary factual statements, representations and
covenants by the Parties, their Subsidiaries and their stockholders
consistent with the existing published guidance of the IRS, including Revenue
Procedures 83-59, 86-42, 90-52, 96-30 and 2003-48 (including, in the case of
Section 4.03 of Revenue Procedure 2003-48, which adds new section 4.08(12) to
Revenue Procedure 96-30, the representation described in subsection (ii)
thereof), in each case with appropriate modifications to reflect the
particular facts of the Transactions (collectively, the "Representations").
For this purpose, Company acknowledges that compliance with Section 4.04(b),
(c) and (d) of the Tax Sharing Agreement is required by the Representations.
Company agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to, and to
cause its Subsidiaries and its stockholders to, assist in obtaining the IRS
Rulings and the Opinions of Counsel, including providing such appropriate
information and representations as the IRS or Dewey Ballantine LLP shall
require in connection with the IRS Rulings or Opinions of Counsel.   (ii)
TWDC shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all ruling
requests and supplements thereto to be submitted to the IRS in
connection with the IRS Rulings (the "IRS Submissions"). Prior to submitting
any IRS Submission, TWDC shall provide Company with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on a draft of the IRS Submission; provided, however,
with respect to statements or representations relating to Company or, after
the Merger, Spinco, Company shall have the right to approve such statements
or representations prior to filing, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, and TWDC shall furnish Company with copies
of all IRS Submissions as submitted to the IRS. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, TWDC may redact from any IRS Submission any information
("Redactable Information") that (y) TWDC, in its good faith judgment,
considers to be confidential information or legal analysis/qualifications
which in either case are not germane to Company\'s or Spinco\'s obligations
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and (z) is not (and is not
reasonably expected to become) a part of any other publicly available
information.   (iii) In the event that (y) TWDC is not able to obtain any of
the IRS Rulings and Opinions of Counsel, or (z) in obtaining the IRS Rulings
and Opinions of Counsel, the Parties would be required to make factual
statements,   67  representations and/or covenants that differ materially
from the Representations and the differences in such factual statements,
representations and/or covenants would reasonably be expected to result in,
in the aggregate, a significant adverse effect on TWDC and its Subsidiaries,
taken as whole (provided that solely for purposes of determining whether the
magnitude of such effect is "significant," such effect shall be measured
relative to the Spinco Entities only and TWDC and its Subsidiaries (other
than the Spinco Entities) shall be disregarded) (a "TWDC Adverse Impact"), on
the one hand, or a significant adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including by affecting Company\'s ability to
take actions in the ordinary course of operating a radio station or radio
network, such as programming changes (including changes in format), adoption
and change of call signs, contracts and other relationships with talent,
sales, employment and labor matters, capital expenditures, ordinary-course
acquisitions and dispositions of assets, acquisitions for cash or debt, and
ordinary (i.e., non-equity-linked and not part of an investment unit)
"straight" debt financing and refinancing as described in Section 1361 of the
Code, but without regard to the identity of the borrower or the lender) (a
"Company Adverse Impact"), on the other hand, TWDC, Spinco and Company shall
use their reasonable best efforts to restructure the Transactions in a manner
that will preserve the economics of the Transactions to TWDC, Spinco,
Company, TWDC Stockholders and Company Stockholders and result in the receipt
of such rulings and opinions.   (iv) If, despite the Parties\' efforts, TWDC
is not able to obtain any of the IRS Rulings and Opinions of Counsel, or may
only obtain such rulings and opinions by providing factual statements,
representations and/or covenants that differ materially from the
Representations and the differences in such factual statements,
representations and/or covenants would reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a TWDC Adverse Impact, TWDC may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i) hereof.   (v) If despite the
Parties\' efforts, TWDC may only obtain the IRS Rulings and Opinions of
Counsel by providing factual statements, representations and/or covenants
that differ materially from the Representations and the differences in such
factual statements, representations and/or covenants would reasonably be
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Adverse
Impact, Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(j) hereof.   (vi) TWDC and Company shall cooperate with each other in
obtaining, and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and stockholders to cooperate
in obtaining and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain), a written
opinion of their respective tax counsel, Kirkland and Ellis LLP, in the case of
the Company, and Dewey Ballantine LLP, in the case of TWDC and Spinco, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and TWDC,
respectively (each such opinion, a "Merger Tax Opinion"), dated as of the
Effective Time, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a
tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Each of the Parties shall deliver to Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Dewey
Ballantine LLP for purposes of the Merger Tax Opinions (and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and stockholders to deliver) reasonably
requested representations and covenants reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Dewey Ballantine LLP.   68  
Section 6.9 Access.   (a) Subject to Section 6.17 hereof, upon reasonable
notice, each of TWDC, with respect to the Business only, Spinco and Company
shall, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement, afford to each other and each other\'s
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other authorized
representatives, reasonable access to its officers, employees, consultants
and representatives and, during normal business hours, in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with business and operations, to its and its
Subsidiaries\' and the Spinco Subsidiaries\' officers, properties, Contracts,
commitments, books, records (including Returns filed and those in
preparation, work papers and other materials relating to Taxes), papers,
plans and drawings and any report, schedule or other document filed or
received by it pursuant to the requirements of the federal or
state securities Laws, and shall use their respective reasonable efforts to
cause its respective representatives to furnish promptly to the other such
additional financial and operating data and other information, including
environmental information, as to its and its Subsidiaries\' and the Spinco
Subsidiaries\' respective businesses and properties as the other or its duly
authorized representatives, as the case may be, may reasonably request, and
instruct its employees, legal counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives to cooperate with the other in such other Party\'s
investigation; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not permit any
Party to conduct any invasive or destructive environmental sampling, testing
or analysis on the other Party\'s property.   (b) For the purposes of this
Section 6.9, all communications, including requests for information or
access, pursuant to this Section 6.9, shall only be made by and among
representatives of each of TWDC, Spinco and Company, each of whom shall
initially be designated in writing by each of TWDC, Spinco and Company,
respectively, and may be replaced with a substitute representative by TWDC,
Spinco or Company from time to time upon reasonable written notice to
the other Parties.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither TWDC, with
respect to the Business, Spinco, Company nor their respective Subsidiaries,
as applicable, shall be required to provide any information to the extent
that any such Person is legally obligated to keep such information
confidential or otherwise not to provide such information or to the extent
that such access would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.
Each of Company, Spinco and TWDC will, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to hold, and will direct its and their officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to hold, any and all information received from any of the
Parties, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 6.10 Director and Officer
Indemnification; Insurance.   (a) Company shall for a period of at least six
years after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors or officers of
TWDC, Spinco, Company, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, and each
individual who prior to the Effective Time becomes a director or officer of
TWDC, Spinco, Company, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, to the
maximum extent allowed under applicable Law in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time   69  (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby).   (b) Company shall maintain in effect for each of the applicable
Persons referred to in clause (a) above for a period of six years after the
Effective Time policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance of at least the same coverage, and containing
terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the
insured, as the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by TWDC or Company, with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time.   Section
6.11 Rule 145 Affiliates. TWDC shall, at least 30 days prior to the Effective
Time, cause to be delivered to Company a list, reviewed by its counsel,
identifying all Persons who are, at the Effective Time, "affiliates"
of Spinco for purposes of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
(each, a "Rule 145 Affiliate"). TWDC shall furnish such information and
documents as Company may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing such
list. TWDC shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is
identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in the list furnished pursuant to this
Section 6.11 to execute a written agreement, substantially in the form of
Exhibit B attached hereto, at least 15 days prior to the Effective Time.  
Section 6.12 Public Announcements. TWDC, Spinco and Company shall consult
with each other prior to making any press release or public
announcement relating to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement prior to such consultation and
without the consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by applicable Law, Order or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case the Party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other Party before issuing any such press release or
making any such public announcement.   Section 6.13 Defense of Litigation.
Each of TWDC, Spinco and Company shall use its reasonable efforts to defend
against all Actions in which such Party is named as a defendant that
challenge or otherwise seek to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the Transactions.
None of TWDC, Spinco or Company shall settle any such Action or fail to
perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any judgment rendered or Order
entered against such Party therein without having previously consulted with
the other Parties. Each of TWDC, Spinco and Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause each of its Affiliates, directors and officers to use all
reasonable efforts to defend any such Action in which such Affiliate,
director or officer is named as a defendant and which seeks any such relief
to comply with this Section 6.13 to the same extent as if such Person was a
Party.   Section 6.14 Notification of Certain Events. Each of the
Parties shall promptly notify the other Parties of: (a) the occurrence,
or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which
could reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of such
Party in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate if the effect thereof
would be that the condition to Effective Time set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.3(a) hereof, as   70  applicable, would be incapable of being
fulfilled as of the Closing Date; (b) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of
any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which could reasonably be
expected to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Business Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable; and (c) the breach by such Party of any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement to be performed or complied
with by it prior to the Effective Time and, as a result thereof,
the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) hereof, as
applicable, would be incapable of being fulfilled as of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that (i) delivery of any notification or information
pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be for notification purposes only and
shall not expand or limit the rights or affect the obligations of any Party
hereunder or give rise to any other liability on the part of any Party, and
(ii) the failure to have complied with this Section 6.14 shall not constitute
a breach or have any implications on any Party\'s rights or obligations
hereunder or give rise to any liability on the part of any Party.   Section
6.15 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Company, TWDC and
Spinco shall take all actions as may be required to cause any (i)
dispositions of Spinco Common Stock or TWDC Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect thereto) or (ii) acquisitions
of Spinco Common Stock or Company common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect thereto) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Company or
TWDC, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3, promulgated under the Exchange
Act.   Section 6.16 Accounting Matters.   (a) In connection with the
information regarding Spinco and the Business provided by TWDC and Spinco
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement, TWDC and Spinco shall use their reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Company two letters from TWDC\'s and Spinco\'s independent
public accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the
Registration Statement shall become effective and one dated the Closing Date,
each addressed to TWDC, Spinco and Company, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Company and reasonably customary in scope and substance for
comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.   (b) In
connection with the information regarding Company provided by Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration

they have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and   71  effect in accordance with its terms.

respect to obligations of the Business only, and Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence, as
a result of the Transactions, of a change in control or any event that

both, would become a default) under any debt instrument of any such entity,
including debt securities registered under the Securities Act, including by
seeking an amendment or waiver of any such change in control or
default; provided, however, that neither TWDC, Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any amounts in connection

Spinco shall use its reasonable efforts to cause all conditions to the
issuance of the Spinco Debt to be satisfied or waived prior to the
Closing.   Section 6.20 Non-Solicitation of Employees.   (a) TWDC agrees
that, for a period of six months from and after the Closing Date it shall
not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written
consent of Spinco, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or hire (or cause
or seek to cause to leave the employ of the Spinco Entities), or enter into a
consulting agreement with, any key Business Employee who (i) has a title of
senior vice president or higher or (ii) is on-air talent, unless such Person
ceased to be an employee of any Spinco Entity prior to such action by TWDC or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than Spinco).   (b) The restrictions set
forth in the foregoing clause (a) shall not apply to (i) general
solicitations (such as advertisements) for employment placed by TWDC or any
of its Subsidiaries and not specifically targeted at the employees of any
Spinco Entity, (ii) responding to or hiring any employee of any Spinco Entity
who contacts TWDC or any of its Subsidiaries without any prior solicitation
(other than as permitted by clause (i) above) or (iii) any employee of any
Spinco Entity who responds to search firm inquiries (so long as not directed
to solicit such person) conducted on behalf of TWDC or any of
its Subsidiaries.   72    (c) Company and Spinco hereby agree that their
sole remedy in the event of a breach of the covenant contained in this
Section 6.20, whether willful or inadvertent, will be an injunction
preventing such employment, and that they will not under any circumstances be
entitled to monetary damages from TWDC, any of its Affiliates or any such
employee with respect to any such breach.   Section 6.21 Covenant Not To
Compete.   (a) In furtherance of the Transactions, TWDC covenants and
agrees that, for a period ending on the third (in the case of clause (i)) or
second (in the case of clause (ii)) anniversary of the Closing Date, neither
TWDC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of
Company, (i) own or operate any broadcast radio station which is operated
pursuant to a License issued by the FCC in any of the Territories, except for
stations that carry the programming of the ESPN Radio(TM) network or the
Radio Disney(TM) network, (ii) distribute audio programming for broadcasting
over a group of affiliated terrestrial radio stations in the United States
(collectively, the "TWDC Competing Business"); provided, however, that
nothing set forth in this Section 6.21 shall prohibit TWDC or its
Subsidiaries from: (i) engaging in any business included in the Excluded
Assets and conducted by TWDC or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding Spinco)
immediately prior to the Closing Date and described in Section 6.21 of the
TWDC/Spinco Disclosure Schedules; (ii) engaging in the production,
development or licensing of content; (iii) the operation of the ESPN Radio

any interest acquired as a creditor in bankruptcy or otherwise than by
a voluntary investment decision; or (v) acquiring the assets or capital stock
or other equity interests of any other Person engaged in a TWDC Competing
Business, provided that in the case of clause (v) such TWDC Competing
Business is divested or terminated within 24 months of its acquisition unless
the end of such 24-month period occurs after the end of the term of this
Section 6.21 in which case the divestiture obligation shall not be
operative.   (b) The Parties agree that the covenants included in this
Section 6.21 are, taken as a whole, reasonable in their geographic and
temporal coverage, and no Party shall raise any issue of geographic or
temporal reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce such covenant; provided,
however, that if the provisions of this Section 6.21 should ever be deemed to
exceed the time or geographic limitations or any other limitations permitted
by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed
reformed in such jurisdiction to the minimum extent required by applicable
Law to cure such problem.   (c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in
the event of a breach of the provisions of this Section 6.21, monetary
damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event
of any such breach, the non-breaching Party may, in addition to any other
rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of Law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or preliminary
and final injunctive relief or other relief in order to enforce or prevent
any violation of the provisions hereof.   Section 6.22 Post-Closing
Cooperation. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Party agrees to
use its reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all documents and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
that may be    73   reasonably necessary or appropriate, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel for each of TWDC, Spinco and Company, to
effectuate the provisions of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS OF

same counterpart.   Section 9.4 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits, the Disclosure Schedules and the

and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under

sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   Section 9.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by,

ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without

so broad as is enforceable.   Section 9.9 Headings. Headings of the Articles
and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only, and
will be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.   Section
9.10 Attorneys\' Fees. If any Action at law or equity, including an Action

behalf of each of the Parties.    82    Section 9.12 Extension; Waiver.

with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing, signed on behalf of such
