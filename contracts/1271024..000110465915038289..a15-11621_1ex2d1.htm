and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Sub I** "), Harpo Acquisition

RECITALS

 



 

A. The boards of directors of each of Parent, Sub I and the Company and the
managing member of Sub II believe it is advisable and in the best interests of
each corporation and their respective stockholders and, with respect to Sub
II, its sole member, that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory
merger of Sub I with and into the Company, pursuant to which the Company would
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " **First Merger** "), and, as
part of the same overall transaction, the surviving entity of the First Merger
would merge with and into Sub II (the " **Second Merger** " and, together with
the First Merger, the " **Mergers** ") upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein and in accordance with Delaware Law (as defined below), and in
furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement and the First Merger.

 



 

B. It is intended that the Mergers are integrated steps in the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and will together qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

C. Pursuant to the Mergers, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (i) all of the issued and
outstanding Company Capital Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
the consideration set forth herein, (ii) all Company Options held by
Continuing Employees shall have been assumed by Parent, in accordance with the
Plan, (iii) all vested Company Options held by Persons other than Continuing
Employees shall be converted into the right to receive cash payments as set
forth herein, and (iv) all unvested Company Options held by Persons other than
Continuing Employees shall be accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Plan
and converted into the right to receive cash payments as set forth herein.

 



 

D. A portion of the consideration otherwise payable by Parent in connection
with the First Merger shall be placed into escrow by Parent as described
herein as security for the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

E. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Subs, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Mergers.

 



 

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a

Agreement, the Key Holder (as defined below) shall have entered into and
delivered to Parent an option amendment agreement (an " **Option Amendment
Agreement** "), to be effective upon the Closing.

 



 

G. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, each Key
Employee shall have entered into an "at will" employment arrangement with
Parent or a subsidiary thereof to be effective as of the Closing Date pursuant
to such Key Employees execution and delivery of an employment agreement and a
proprietary

 



      
 

 



 

information and inventions assignment agreement on Parents standard form
(collectively, the " **Key Employee Agreements** ").

 



 

H. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Subs to enter into this
Agreement, the Key Holder, who is a Company Optionholder, shall have entered
into and delivered to Parent a non-competition agreement (the " **Non-
Competition Agreement** "), to be effective upon the Closing.

 



 

I. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto and as a material inducement to Parent and Merger Subs to enter
into this Agreement, the Company shall obtain and shall deliver to Parent a
true, correct and complete copy of an executed action by written consent
evidencing the approval of the First Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and the other matters contemplated therein,
in the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit A_** (the " **Stockholder Written
Consent** "), signed by (i) the holders of at least 95% of the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock (voting together as a single class on an as-
converted basis); (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of Company
Common Stock; and (iii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class), in each case, as of the
record date (the votes referred to in clauses "(i)" through "(iii)" of this
sentence being referred to collectively as the " **Required Stockholder
Votes** ").

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance
thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware (" **Delaware Law** "), Sub I
shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Sub I shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after
the First Merger is sometimes referred to hereinafter as the " **First-Step
Surviving Corporation**." At the Second Effective Time (as defined below),
Parent shall cause the First-Step Surviving Corporation to merge with and into
Sub II in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate corporate
existence of the First-Step Surviving Corporation shall cease, and Sub II
shall be the surviving entity. The surviving entity after the Second Merger is
sometimes referred to hereinafter as the " **Surviving Entity**."

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_.

 



 

(a) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to **Section 8.1**
hereof, the closing of the First Merger (the " **Closing** ") will take place
after the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto on a Business
Day as promptly as practicable but not later than two (2) Business Days
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in **Article VI
**hereof (except for those conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California
94304, unless another time or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs shall
be referred to herein as the " **Closing Date**." On the Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall cause the

 



      
 

 



 

First Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger in
substantially the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit B-1_** (the "
**Certificate of Merger** "), with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the
time of the filing of such Certificate of Merger, or the time of effectiveness
thereof that is specified therein, if different, shall be referred to herein
as the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in all cases within one (1)
Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Second Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger in substantially the form
attached hereto as **_Exhibit B-2_** with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the
time of the filing of such certificate of merger with respect to the Second
Merger, or the time of effectiveness thereof that is specified therein, if
different, shall be referred to herein as the " **Second Effective Time** ").

 



 

1.3 _Effect of the Mergers_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the First
Merger shall be as provided under the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Sub I shall vest in the First-Step Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Sub I shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the First-Step Surviving Corporation. Following the
Second Merger, the effect of the Second Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Second Effective Time, all the

Step Surviving Corporation shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Sub II and
the First-Step Surviving Corporation shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the First-Step
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time
to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Sub I as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of
the certificate of incorporation of the First-Step Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the
corporation is "lynda.com, Inc." The certificate of formation of Sub II, as in
effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Entity at the Second Effective Time.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the First-Step Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be identical to the
bylaws of Sub I, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the
certificate of incorporation of the First-Step Surviving Corporation and such
bylaws. The limited liability company agreement of Sub II, as in effect
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, shall be the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Entity at the Second Effective Time.

 



 

1.5 _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) _Directors of the First-Step Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Sub
I immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the First-
Step Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold
the office of a director of the First-Step Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the First-Step Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



 

(b) _Officers of the First-Step Surviving Corporation_. The officers of Sub I

has completed and delivered to the Company or Parent prior to the Closing Date
a Joinder Agreement or an investor questionnaire in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent certifying that such Company Stockholder is
an "accredited investor" as set forth therein (for avoidance of doubt, subject
to clause (ii), any Company Stockholder who has not completed and delivered
such Joinder Agreement or investor questionnaire prior to the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be an Unaccredited Stockholder for purposes of this
Agreement) or (ii) is determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion to be
an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the
Securities Act.

other such conditions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Company
Options held by Non-Continuing Employees).

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in **Section 1.11** hereof and throughout this
Agreement, including the provisions set forth in **Article VII** hereof, will
be cancelled and extinguished and will be converted automatically into the
right to receive upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of
Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in **Section 1.11** hereof, (A)
the Closing Per Share Amount (without interest thereon) plus (B) any
applicable Additional Per Share Amount.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Legends on Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Security Entitlements_. The
certificates or book-entry security entitlements representing shares of Parent

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT") AND MAY NOT BE
OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND
UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE 1933 ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER,

(c) _Treatment of Company Options_.

 



 

(i) _Effect on Company Options_.

 



 

(A) _Company Options Held by Continuing Employees_. Immediately following the
Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, each Company Option held by
a Continuing Employee that is unexpired and unexercised shall be assumed by
Parent as a Parent Option. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
each Company Option so assumed by Parent pursuant to this **Section
1.7(c)(i)(A)** shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the Plan and the option
agreements relating thereto as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (A) such assumed Company Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option
shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such assumed Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code is intended to
apply by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code (an "
**Incentive Stock Option** "), the exercise price of the Parent Option, the
number of shares purchasable pursuant to such Parent Option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such Parent Option shall be determined in order to
comply with Section 424 of the Code and any Company Option that is not an
Incentive Stock Option shall be adjusted in a manner to comply with Section
409A of the Code.

 



 

(B) _Company Options Held by Non-Continuing Employees_. At the Effective Time,
each Vested Company Option (including each Unvested Company Option that shall
be accelerated and become a Vested Company Option) that is held by a Non-
Continuing Employee and that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be assumed by Parent and
will, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the part
of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted without exercise into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the dollar value of (A) the Closing Per Option
Amount plus (B) any applicable Additional Per Option Amount.

 



 

(C) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be reasonably necessary (under the Plan or otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 1.7(c)(i)** and to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Option that
was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that was cancelled as
provided in this **Section 1.7(c)(i)** shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration specified in
this **Section 1.7(c)(i)** without interest.

 



 

(D) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt Board resolutions
approving the full acceleration of vesting of all Company Options listed on
**Schedule 1.6(g)** , to be effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time with such resolutions subject to the reasonable review and approval by
Parent.

 



 

(d) _Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Subs_. At the Effective Time, each
share of common stock of Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the First-Step
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub I evidencing ownership of
any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation. At the Second Effective Time,
each membership interest certificate, if any, of Sub II issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted into and
exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership
interest certificate of the Surviving Entity. Each membership interest
certificate (if any) of Sub II evidencing ownership of any such interests
shall continue to evidence ownership of such interests of the Surviving
Entity.

 



 

(e) _Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the First Merger, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company
or Parent, or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or
of Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or the right to receive any
consideration therefor.

 



 

1.8 _Calculation_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to each Company Security Holder pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each Company
Security Holder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis. The
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each Company
Security Holder for each share certificate shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and no cash will be
paid for fractional shares; _provided, however_ , that the maximum number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the First Merger shall not
exceed the Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount.

 



 

(b) For purposes of calculating the amount of cash payable to each Company
Security Holder pursuant to this Agreement, all shares of Company Capital
Stock held (or deemed to be held, as the case may be) by each Company Security
Holder shall be aggregated, and the aggregate amount of cash issuable to each
Company Security Holder shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the maximum amount of cash
payable to all Company Security Holders pursuant to this Agreement exceed the
Aggregate Cash Consideration Amount.

 



 

1.9 _Unpaid Liabilities Reconciliation_.

 



 

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a written statement (the " **Statement
of Specified Liabilities** ") which sets forth an estimate as of the Closing
of (i) the Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes that are estimated to be accrued for Tax
purposes on or before the Closing Date (but shall exclude (A) any Liability
for accruals or

 



      
 

 



 

reserves established in accordance with GAAP for contingent Taxes or uncertain
Tax positions and (B) any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes otherwise included in the
calculation of Net Working Capital), (ii) the Third Party Expenses of the
Company that will not have been satisfied as of the Closing, (iii) fifty
percent (50%) of any Third Party Expenses which were satisfied out of the cash
balances that will be part of Closing Cash on the Closing Date, (iv) the
Indebtedness of the Company ((i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), collectively, the "
**Specified Pre-Closing Liabilities** "). Parent and its representatives,
including Parents independent accountants, will be entitled to review all
work papers of the Company and its representatives, including its independent
accountants, prepared in connection with the delivery of the Statement of
Specified Liabilities. Nothing set forth in this **Section 1.9(a) **shall
limit any rights of any party as set forth in this **Section 1.9** or of any
Indemnified Party as set forth in **Article VII.**

 



 

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the " **Reconciliation
Notice** ") of the actual amount of the Specified Pre-Closing Liabilities of
the Company as of the Closing (the " **Actual Unpaid Liabilities** "), and the
difference, if any, between the amount of Actual Unpaid Liabilities and the
Specified Pre-Closing Liabilities. The Actual Unpaid Liabilities shall consist
of (i) any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes that accrued for Tax purposes on or before
the Closing Date (but shall exclude (A) any Liability for accruals or reserves
established in accordance with GAAP for contingent Taxes or uncertain Tax
positions and (B) any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes otherwise included in the
calculation of Net Working Capital), (ii) any Third Party Expenses of the
Company that were not paid prior to the Closing, (iii) fifty percent (50%) of
any Third Party Expenses which were satisfied out of the cash balances that
were part of Closing Cash on the Closing Date and (iv) any Indebtedness of the
Company that was not paid prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Actual Unpaid Liabilities do not exceed the Specified Pre-Closing
Liabilities, Parent may, but shall not be required to, deliver a
Reconciliation Notice with respect to the Actual Unpaid Liabilities, as
applicable.

 



 

(c) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the Actual Unpaid Liabilities
set forth in the Reconciliation Notice, the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver to Parent written notice of such dispute (the " **Dispute Notice** ")
within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Reconciliation Notice, which
shall list with reasonable specificity the Stockholder Representatives points
of disagreement with Parents calculation of the Actual Unpaid Liabilities, as
applicable. The Stockholder Representatives failure to provide a Dispute
Notice within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Reconciliation Notice
shall be deemed an acceptance of such Reconciliation Notice and Parents
calculation of the Actual Unpaid Liabilities. Upon receipt of the Dispute
Notice, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall promptly consult with
each other with respect to the specified points of disagreement in an effort
to resolve the dispute during the forty-five (45) calendar days immediately
following Parents receipt of the Dispute Notice, or such longer period as
Parent and the Stockholder Representative may mutually agree. Any such
disputed items that are resolved by Parent and the Stockholder Representative
during such period shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and not
subject to appeal. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative do not resolve
all such disputed items by the end of such forty-five (45) day period, such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with **Section 1.10(c)**.

 



 

(d) After the acceptance or final determination of the Actual Unpaid
Liabilities, if (A) the amount of the Actual Unpaid Liabilities is greater
than (B) the Specified Pre-Closing Liabilities (the amount, if any, by which
(A) is greater than (B), the " **Excess Consideration** "), then the Excess
Consideration shall be paid to Parent out of the Escrow Amount in accordance
with **Section 7.5(a)**.

 



 

1.10 _Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Reconciliation_.

 



 

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall have delivered to Parent (i) a written statement (the " **Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement** ")

 



      
 

 



 

which sets forth an estimate of the Net Working Capital (such estimate, the "
**Estimated Net Working Capital** ") and (ii) a written statement setting
forth a good faith estimate of the Closing Cash (such estimate, the "
**Estimated Closing Cash** ") (such statement, the " **Estimated Cash
Statement** "). The Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and Estimated Cash
Statement will each have been prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP
and in the same way, using the same methodologies and accounting practices and
principles applied on a consistent basis (including with respect to
determining estimates and allowances) as the line items comprising the
illustrative calculation of Net Working Capital set forth on **Schedule
1.10(a)**. Parent and its representatives, including Parents independent
accountants, will be entitled to review all work papers of the Company and its
representatives, including its independent accountants, prepared in connection
with the delivery of the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and the
Estimated Cash Statement. Nothing set forth in this **Section 1.10** shall
limit any rights of any party as set forth in this **Section 1.10** or of any
Indemnified Party as set forth in **Article VII**.

 



 

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the " **Working
Capital Reconciliation Notice** ") which includes the following information
with respect to the Company: (i) a balance sheet of the Company, as of
immediately prior to the Closing on the Closing Date, prepared in accordance
with GAAP, applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, that were used in
the preparation of the Financials (the " **Closing Date Balance Sheet** "),
and (ii) based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, a calculation of the actual
Net Working Capital and the difference, if any, between the Estimated Net
Working Capital and such calculation of the actual Net Working Capital, and
(iii) based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, a calculation of the actual
Closing Cash and the difference, if any, between the Estimated Closing Cash
and such calculation of the actual Closing Cash. Following the delivery to the
Stockholder Representative of the Reconciliation Notice or the Working Capital
Reconciliation Notice, as applicable, the Stockholder Representative and its
representatives and agents shall be given all such access (including
electronic access, to the extent available) as they may reasonably require to
the books and records of the Surviving Entity and reasonable access during
normal business hours to such personnel or representatives of the Surviving
Entity and Parent, including to the individuals responsible for preparing such
notice, as they may reasonably require for the purposes of investigating or
resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in
such notice.

 



 

(c) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the actual Net Working Capital
or the actual Closing Cash set forth in the Working Capital Reconciliation
Notice, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent written notice
of such dispute (the " **Working Capital Dispute Notice** ") within forty-five
(45) days of receipt of the Working Capital Reconciliation Notice, which shall
list with reasonable specificity the Stockholder Representatives points of
disagreement with Parents calculation of the actual Net Working Capital or
actual Closing Cash, as applicable. The Stockholder Representatives failure
to provide a Working Capital Dispute Notice within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of the Working Capital Reconciliation Notice shall be deemed an
acceptance of such Working Capital Reconciliation Notice and Parents
calculation of the actual Net Working Capital and actual Closing Cash. Upon
receipt of the Working Capital Dispute Notice, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall promptly consult with each other with respect to the
specified points of disagreement in an effort to resolve the dispute during
the forty-five (45) calendar days immediately following Parents receipt of
the Working Capital Dispute Notice, or such longer period as Parent and the
Stockholder Representative may mutually agree. Any such disputed items that
are resolved by Parent and the Stockholder Representative during such period
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If
Parent and the Stockholder Representative do not resolve all such disputed
items by the end of such forty-five (45) day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall submit all items remaining in dispute with
respect to the Dispute Notice or Working Capital Dispute Notice, as
applicable, to KPMG LLP or any other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm upon which

 



      
 

 



 

Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall reasonably agree (the "
**Accounting Firm** ") for review and resolution. The Accounting Firm shall
act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall make all
calculations in accordance with the practices used in preparation of the
Statement of Specified Liabilities, the Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement and the Estimated Cash Statement, as applicable, shall determine
only those items remaining in dispute between Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, and shall only be permitted or authorized to determine an
amount with respect to any such disputed item that is either (i) the amount of
such disputed item as proposed by Parent in the Reconciliation Notice, the
Working Capital Reconciliation Notice, or the Closing Date Balance Sheet, as
applicable or (ii) the amount of such disputed item as proposed by the
Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Notice or Working Capital Dispute
Notice, as applicable. Each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
(i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm at the
time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate
with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to submit a written
statement in support of their respective positions with respect to such
disputed items, to provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in
defense of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items and
to submit a written statement responding to the other partys position with
respect to such disputed items and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality
and indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their
respective books, records, personnel and representatives and such other
information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its
determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Parent
and the Stockholder Representative a written determination (such determination
to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in
arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information provided
to the Accounting Firm by Parent and the Stockholder Representative) of the
disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed
items, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
and not subject to appeal. The non-prevailing party in any dispute resolved
pursuant to this **Section 1.10(c)** shall pay its own expenses, the fees of
the Accounting Firm and the reasonable costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the
arbitration.

 



 

(d) After the acceptance or final determination of the actual Net Working
Capital, (i) if (A) the amount of the actual Working Capital Adjustment is
less than (B) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (the amount, if any, by
which (A) is less than (B), the " **Working Capital Deficiency** "), then the
absolute value of the Working Capital Deficiency shall be paid to Parent out
of the Escrow Amount in accordance with **Section 7.5(a)**, and (ii) if (x)
the amount of the actual Working Capital Adjustment is greater than (y) the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (the amount, if any, by which (x) is
greater than (y), the " **Shortfall Consideration** "), then the Shortfall
Consideration shall be paid in cash by Parent or the paying agent selected by
Parent to the Indemnifying Parties within five (5) Business Days of such
acceptance of final determination, in proportion to such Indemnifying Parties
respective Pro Rata Portion.

 



 

(e) After the acceptance or final determination of the actual Closing Cash,
(i) if (A) the amount of the actual Closing Cash is less than (B) the
Estimated Closing Cash (the amount, if any, by which (A) is less than (B), the
" **Closing Cash Deficiency** "), then the absolute value of 50% of the
Closing Cash Deficiency shall be paid to Parent out of the Escrow Amount in
accordance with **Section 7.5(a)**, and (ii) if (A) the amount of the actual
Closing Cash is greater than (B) the Estimated Closing Cash (the amount, if
any, by which (A) is greater than (B), the " **Closing Cash Shortfall** "),
then 50% of the Closing Cash Shortfall shall be paid in cash by Parent or the
paying agent selected by Parent to the Indemnifying Parties within five (5)
Business Days of such acceptance of final determination, in proportion to such
Indemnifying Parties respective Pro Rata Portion.

 



      
 

 



 

1.11 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Parent Closing Payments_.

 



 

(i) Within two (2) Business Days of the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
the paying agent the cash portion of the Total Consideration payable to the
Company Security Holders pursuant to **Section 1.7** , less the cash portion
of the Escrow Amount, which will be deposited into escrow pursuant to
**Section 1.11(a)(ii)** and the Expense Fund Amount, which will be deposited
with the Stockholder Representative pursuant to **Section 1.11(a)(iii)**, in
each case, assuming for this purpose a Cash Election Percentage of 100% for
any Company Stockholder who has not then submitted a properly completed
Investor Questionnaire and Letter of Transmittal (each, an " **Non-Electing
Holder** ").

 



 

(ii) Within two (2) Business Days of the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent to hold in trust as an escrow fund
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, assuming for
this purpose a Cash Election Percentage of 100% for each Non-Electing Holder.

 



 

(iii) Within two (2) Business Days of the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit
the Expense Fund Amount with the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(b) Parent shall make available at the Closing, and mail, or shall cause to be
mailed, to each Company Stockholder promptly (but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days) following the Effective Time a letter of transmittal in a
form to be mutually agreed between the parties (the " **Letter of
Transmittal** ") that shall (i) specify that delivery of certificates
representing such Company Stockholders shares of Company Capital Stock (the "
**Company Stock Certificates** ") shall be deemed to have occurred, and, with
respect to Company Stock Certificates, risk of loss and title to the Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock
Certificates to Parent, (ii) include an undertaking to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement and a confirmation of the Stockholder Representative as the
agent of such holder pursuant to **Section 7.8** for the purposes set forth
herein, (iii) include an IRS Form W-9 or instructions on how to obtain IRS
Form W-8BEN (or other applicable Form W-8), as applicable, (iv) include an
undertaking to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Entity for withholding Taxes
with respect to the applicable holder (including penalties and interest
arising from amounts not withheld pursuant to representations made by, or
directions given by, such holder) in the event the appropriate amount of Taxes
is not withheld from payments made to the applicable holder as required by
applicable Law, and (v) include any other information required pursuant to any
applicable Law. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation
to Parent, together with an accredited investor questionnaire (the "
**Investor Questionnaire** ") and such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed
and properly completed, and specifying the Cash Election Percentage elected by
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate, in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate (each such
holder, a " **Surrendering Holder** ") shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor from Parent the consideration that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the Company Stock Certificates surrendered pursuant
to the provisions of **Section 1.7** as specified in the Spreadsheet, after
giving effect to any withholding Tax required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable Law, and the instrument so surrendered or transferred shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the
consideration payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates. Upon receiving
any Company Stock Certificates, together with Letters of Transmittal that are
complete and accurate, in accordance with the above, Parent shall promptly
issue the applicable Closing Per Share Stock Amount that the Surrendering
Holders that have delivered such Company Stock Certificates are entitled to
receive in exchange for such cancelled Company Stock Certificates pursuant to
**Section 1.7**. For the avoidance of doubt, the recorded date of issuance for
any such shares of Parent Common Stock shall be the Closing Date. After the
Closing, in the event any Non-Electing Holder specifies a Cash Election
Percentage other than 100% pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal submitted by
such Non-Election Holder, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
update the Spreadsheet with such Cash Election Percentage and, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent necessary, take such actions as are required to adjust the Cash Escrow
Amount and the Stock Escrow Amount to reflect such updated Spreadsheet.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall surrender the certificate(s)
representing the shares of Sub I, and the First-Step Surviving Corporation
shall issue to Parent in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates
representing the number of shares of common stock of the First-Step Surviving
Corporation to which Parent is entitled pursuant to **Section** **1.7(d)**.

 



 

(d) If the cash payment or check evidencing the cash to be paid pursuant to
**Section 1.7** hereof is to be made to a Person other than the Person whose
name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate
so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the payment of any portion of the Total Consideration in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) None of Parent, the Surviving Entity, any Affiliate of the foregoing or
any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Total Consideration and any portion of the Escrow Amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 



 

1.12 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his, her or its
appraisal rights under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the California
Corporations Code (the " **CCC** "), if applicable (the " **Dissenting
Shares** ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the payments set
forth in **Section 1.7** unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed
to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his, her or its right
to dissent from the First Merger under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the
CCC, if applicable, and to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the
requirements of the Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect
of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would
have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement
or (ii) incurs any Losses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys and
consultants fees, costs and expenses and including any such fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or
settling in accordance with **Article VII **any action or proceeding) in
respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) ((i) and
(ii) together, " **Dissenting Share Payments** "), Parent shall be entitled to
seek recovery under the terms of **Section 7.2** hereof the amount by which
such Dissenting Share Payments exceed the amounts otherwise payable hereunder
to the holders of such Dissenting Shares as if such holders had waived all of
their respective rights to dissent and appraisal rights with respect to the
First Merger _._

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the
CCC, if applicable, and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable; _provided_
that, prior to the Closing, the Company, and after the Closing, the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying

 



      
 

 



 

Parties, shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in all such
negotiations and proceedings, and Parent shall consider in good faith input
from the Company and the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, with
respect thereto. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

1.13 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The portion of
the Total Consideration paid or payable in respect of the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Entity of shares of
Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this **Article I**.

 



 

1.14 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or agreements, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such
consideration, if any, as may be required pursuant to **Section 1.7** hereof
or the Spreadsheet, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may,
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Company
Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to
deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct, indemnifying Parent
against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the
certificates or agreements alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

1.15 _Tax Consequences_. The parties to this Agreement agree to treat the
First Merger and the Second Merger as integrated steps in the single
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, which qualifies as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). The parties agree to file all Tax Returns
consistent with, and will not otherwise take any Tax position inconsistent
with, such treatment unless otherwise required by a Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representations or warranties
to the Company or to any Company Security Holder regarding the Tax treatment
of the Mergers, or any of the Tax consequences to the Company or any Company
Security Holder of this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other
transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that
the Company and the Company Security Holders are relying solely on their own
Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions and agreements contemplated hereby. In the event that the parties
determine in good faith that Mergers will fail to satisfy the 40% "continuity
of interest" test (calculated using the final closing price of the parent
common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date), and
therefore may fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code, the parties shall cooperate in good faith with each other to take (or
cause to be taken) commercially reasonable actions, including without
limitation amending this Agreement as may be reasonably necessary, in order to
ensure that the Mergers will so qualify.

 



 

1.16 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Company and, on its behalf, Parent, and the Surviving Entity
and any agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law or under
any applicable legal requirement, and to request and be provided any necessary
tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate version of Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar information. To the extent any such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid to the proper Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



      
 

 



 

1.17 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company, Parent, Merger Subs, and the officers and directors
of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

following actions with any party other than Parent and its designees: (A)
solicit, initiate, conduct or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
negotiations or discussions with respect to any offer or proposal regarding
any sale of Company Capital Stock or the capital stock of any of the Companys
subsidiaries, any merger or acquisition, or similar transactions as well as
any sale, lease, license or other disposition of any material assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (a " **Competing Transaction** "), or
effect any such transaction, (B) disclose any information to any Person
concerning the business or properties of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or afford to any Person access to the properties of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, books or records, in each case, other than in the
ordinary course of business, (C) assist or cooperate with any Person to make
any proposal regarding a Competing Transaction, or (D) enter into any
agreement with any Person providing for a Competing Transaction. In the event
that the Company, or any of its affiliates or representatives shall receive,
prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with **Section 8.1** of this Agreement, any offer, proposal, or
request, directly or indirectly, of the type referenced in clause (A), (C) or
(D) above, or any request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (B)
above, the Company or such affiliate shall (x) immediately terminate, suspend
or otherwise discontinue any and all discussions or other negotiations with
such Person with regard to such offers, proposals, or requests and (y)
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such event) notify Parent
thereof, including information as to the identity of the Person making any
such offer or proposal and the specific terms of such offer or proposal, as
the case may be, and provide such other information related thereto,
including, but not limited to a copy of any written inquiry, offer or proposal
or a summary of the principal terms of any such inquiry, offer or proposal
that is not in writing.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that the provisions of **Section 4.2(a)** were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction
or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other
security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this **Section 4.2** and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be

 



      
 

 



 

entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any officer,
director, agent, representative or affiliate of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



 

4.3 _Access to Information_. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law
or as would be reasonably expected to violate the attorney-client or other
legal privilege of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (it being agreed
that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause such information
to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation, prohibition or
loss of privilege), the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
to (a) all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments and records of the
Company and its subsidiaries, including all Company IP (including access to
design processes and methodologies and all source code), (b) all other
information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to
restrictions imposed by applicable Law) of the Company as Parent may
reasonably request, and (c) all Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
as identified by Parent. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the officers, Employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and
other representatives of the Company to cooperate with Parent and Parents
representatives in connection with such access and all reasonable information
requests made by Parent. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial
statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon
request. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this **Section 4.3** or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the First Merger in accordance with
the terms and provisions hereof.

 



 

4.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall give prompt notice to the other parties of: (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to cause the failure of
any of the conditions set forth in **Section 6.2(a)** or **Section 6.3(a)** ,
as the case may be, (b) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and (c) the
occurrence of any Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company,
_provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
**Section 4.4** shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to
the party receiving such notice; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the
Companys unintentional failure to give notice under this **Section 4.4**
shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this **Section 4.4** but
instead shall constitute only a breach of the underlying representation or
warranty or covenant, condition or agreement, as the case may be, where in the
case of any breach of a representation or warranty, such breach will be
determined as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date (or, if such
representation or warranty is made as of a specified date, as of such date).
No disclosure by the Company, or Parent pursuant to this **Section 4.4**,
however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or
prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of representation or warranty or
breach of any covenant.

(C) the conversion of Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock.

 



 

(b) The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the solicitation
of the requisite Company Stockholder approval described in **Section
5.1(c)**, a 280G Waiver from each Person in substantially the form attached
hereto as **_Exhibit D_** (the " **280G Waiver** ") whom the Company
reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to
the initiation of the solicitation of the requisite Company Stockholder
approval described in **Section 5.1(c)**, and who might otherwise receive or
have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section
280G of the Code, unless the requisite Company Stockholder approval of such
parachute payments is obtained pursuant to **Section 5.1(c)**.

 



 

(c) Promptly following the delivery by the Company to Parent of each 280G
Waiver described in **Section 5.1(b)**, the Company shall submit to the
Company Stockholders for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) by such number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments and/or benefits that are
subject to a 280G Waiver and that Parent determines may separately or in the
aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent (i) that a
Company Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requisite Company Stockholder
approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were
subject to the Company Stockholder vote (the " **280G Approval**") or (ii)
that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such
"parachute payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to the waivers of
those payments and/or benefits which were executed by the affected individuals
on the date of this Agreement.

"), shall be subject to review and approval by Parent and shall include
information regarding the Company, the terms of the First Merger and this
Agreement, and the unanimous recommendation of the Board in favor of the First
Merger and this Agreement. The Company will promptly advise Parent in writing
if at any time prior to the Closing the Company obtains Knowledge of any facts
that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the
Soliciting Materials in order to make statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable Law. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include
in the Soliciting Materials any information with respect to Parent or its
affiliates or associates, the

 



      
 

 



 

form and content of which shall not have been consented to in writing by
Parent prior to such inclusion, except as required pursuant to applicable Law.

 



 

5.2 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto (other than the Stockholder
Representative) hereby agrees that the information obtained in any

contemplated hereby, or, if applicable, in connection with any disputes or
arbitration proceedings, shall be governed by the terms of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement dated as of March 6, 2015 (the " **Confidential Disclosure
Agreement** ") between the Company and Parent until Closing. In this regard,
the Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly traded and
that any information obtained during the course of its due diligence could be
considered to be material non-public information within the meaning of federal
and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and agrees
not to engage in any discussions, correspondence or transactions in the Parent
Common Stock in violation of applicable securities laws. The Stockholder
Representative agrees that that certain Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of
March 24, 2015, by and between the Stockholder Representative and the Company
shall survive the Closing, shall cover all information received from Parent or
the Surviving Entity after the Closing, and shall be enforceable by Parent or
the Surviving Entity after the Closing.

 



 

5.3 _Public Disclosure_. The Company shall not (nor will it permit, as
applicable, any of its officers, directors, members, employees, stockholders,
agents, partners, representatives or affiliates to), directly or indirectly,
issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than its agents
that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if
applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor or any
disputes or arbitration proceedings, without the consent of Parent, except (a)
to the extent such disclosure is required by applicable Law, in which case the
Company shall promptly notify Parent and cooperate with Parent to the extent
reasonably practicable so as to seek to limit the information disclosed to the
information it is advised by counsel is required by such applicable Law to be
disclosed and will, to the extent reasonably practicable and at Parents cost
and expense, seek to obtain a protective order over, or confidential treatment
of such information, (b) to the extent that such information is or becomes
generally known to the public without violation of this Agreement, the
Confidential Disclosure Agreement or any other agreement or obligation
restricting the disclosure of such information by such party, (c) to the
extent reasonably required to obtain the Required Stockholder Votes or other
consents or approvals required by this Agreement to be obtained and (d) from
and after the Closing, to the extent disclosure is made by a Company
Stockholder that is a venture capital or private equity fund in communications
to its investors as may be (i) legally or contractually required or (ii)
reasonably necessary in the good faith exercise of the fiduciary duties of the
general partner of such Company Stockholder.

 



 

5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto (other than the Stockholder Representative) shall use
reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, to cause
all conditions to the obligations of the other parties hereto to cause the
First Merger to occur, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals
and other documents required to be delivered hereunder and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or other
impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of
securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor Parent shall be required
to agree to (a) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of its capital
stock or of any of its businesses,

 



      
 

 



 

assets or properties, its subsidiaries or affiliates, (b) the imposition of
any limitation on the ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the
Company to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or
assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their
respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the business of the Company,
or (c) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or
affiliates or the Company under any statute, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing competition,
monopolies or restrictive trade practices (any such action described in (a),
(b) or (c), an " **Action of Divestiture** "). Nothing herein shall require
Parent or the Company to litigate with any third party, including without
limitation, any Governmental Entity.

 



 

(b) The parties (other than the Stockholder Representative) will, or will
cause their "ultimate parent entities" as that term is defined in the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " **HSR Act**
"), as promptly as reasonably practicable, to make all necessary filings and
notifications and other submissions with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and, in any event, to each file the Notification and Report
Form under the HSR Act no more than two (2) Business Day after the date
hereof. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly inform the other of any material communication between
the Company or Parent (as applicable) and any Governmental Entity regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and if in writing, furnish
the other party with a copy of such communication). If the Company or Parent
or any affiliate thereof shall receive any formal or informal request for
supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company or Parent (as applicable) shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request. Without
limiting the generality or effect of **Section 5.4(a)** , to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body, the parties hereto (other than the Stockholder
Representative) shall (i) consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act and (ii) provide advance
notice of and permit authorized representatives of the other party to be
present at each meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity. Parent
shall be entitled, after consultation with the Company and consideration in
good faith of the views of the Company, to make all strategic and tactical
decisions as to the manner in which to obtain from any Governmental Entity
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law any actions or non-actions,
consents, approvals, authorizations, clearances or orders required to be
obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company will not, nor will it permit any of its representatives
to make any material communications with, or proposals relating to, or enter
into, any material understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without Parents prior review and approval. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under any HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA
Affiliate shall terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any and all plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " **401(k) Plan** ")
(unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans
shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the
Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that each 401(k) Plan has been
terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board, or such

 



      
 

 



 

ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating each 401(k)
Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

 



 

5.6 _Consents_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to each of
the Contracts listed on **Schedule 5.6** as are required thereunder in
connection with the Mergers or for any such Contracts to remain in full force
and effect so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits to, the Company under
such Contract as of immediately after the Effective Time. Such consents,
waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 



 

5.7 _Terminated Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have
caused each of the agreements listed on **Schedule 5.7** attached hereto (the
" **Terminated Agreements** ") to be terminated, effective as of and
contingent upon the Closing, including sending all required notices, such that
each such agreement shall be of no further force or effect immediately
following the Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the Company shall have paid
all amounts owed under the Terminated Agreements (as a result of the
termination of the Terminated Agreements or otherwise), and the Surviving
Entity will not incur any claim, Liability or obligation (absolute, accrued,
asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise) under any Terminated
Agreement following the Closing Date. In the event the First Merger does not
close for any reason, Parent shall not have any Liability to the Company or
any other Person for any costs, claims, Liabilities or damages resulting from
the Company seeking to obtain such terminations.

 



 

5.8 _Notices_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have sent each of the
notices set forth in **Schedule 5.8** attached hereto (the " **Notices** ").

 



 

5.9 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall have caused each officer and director of the Company to execute
a resignation letter in the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit E_** (the "
**Director and Officer Resignation Letter** "), effective as of the Effective
Time.

 



 

5.10 _Expenses_. Whether or not the First Merger is consummated, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the First Merger (whether prior to or
following Closing) including all legal, accounting (including, for the sake of
clarity, any audit fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and delivery of the Required Financials in excess of $290,000, but
excluding the initial $290,000 from Third Party Expenses), financial advisory,
consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties (including holders
of Company Capital Stock and Company Options) incurred by a party (including
the Indemnifying Parties) in connection with the negotiation and effectuation
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any payments made or anticipated to be made by
such party as a brokerage or finders fee, agents commission or any similar
charge, in connection with the Mergers, whenever incurred, including the
Executive Severance Obligations, the Compilr 2015 Payment and the Specified
Bonuses, but excluding the Non-Continuing Employee Severance Obligations and
the Aggregate Excess Vacation Amount (" **Third Party Expenses** "), shall be
the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and expenses;
provided, that any such Third Party Expenses incurred by the Stockholder
Representative shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties. The Company shall
provide, no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to
Parent a statement of Estimated Third Party Expenses showing detail of all
unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred and expected to be incurred by the
Company (including any Third Party Expenses anticipated to be incurred after
the Closing) prior to the execution of this Agreement in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and certified as true and correct as of the Closing
Date by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the " **Statement of Expenses**
"). Any Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company that are not reflected on
the Statement of Expenses, and thus were not included as part of

 



      
 

 



 

the calculation of the Total Consideration, shall be paid out of the Escrow
Amount in accordance with **Section 1.9** and **Section 7.4**.

 



 

5.11 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Preparation of Tax Returns.

 



 

(i) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (the " **Parent
Prepared Returns** "). Such Parent Prepared Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Companys past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law. At least twenty (20) days prior to the due date of
any Parent Prepared Return that reflects a Tax for which the Indemnifying
Parties may be liable, Parent shall provide a draft of such Parent Prepared
Return to the Stockholder Representative for the Stockholder Representatives
review and comment. Parent shall consider in good faith all changes to such
Parent Prepared Returns reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative
in writing.

 



 

(ii) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Parent will not, and will
cause the Surviving Entity and each of its subsidiaries not to, take any of
the following actions with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns in each case for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, if such action would reasonably be expected to
give rise to an indemnification claim against the Company Stockholders under
this Agreement: (A) amend any previously filed Tax Return of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or (B) change any Tax election with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, without the written consent
of the Stockholder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that if Parent determines
that, under applicable Law, Parent, the Surviving Entity, its subsidiaries or
any of their Affiliates is required to take any of the foregoing actions,
Parent shall provide reasonable written notice to the Stockholder
Representative prior to taking any such action and shall consider in good
faith any comments made by the Stockholder Representative with respect
thereto. Following the Closing, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to, in good faith consultation with the
Stockholder Representative, initiate and control any "voluntary disclosure
agreement" or similar process of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall consider in good faith any
comments made by the Stockholder Representative with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to the Company, its
subsidiaries or their operations and any pending or threatened audit,
litigation, proceedings or assessments with respect thereto or to Taxes owed
by the Company or its subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include Parents
retention and provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Tax Contests_. Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative in
writing within ten (10) days upon the receipt of any notice, or becoming
aware, of any audit, examination, or other legal proceeding with respect to
Taxes for which the Company Stockholders may be liable pursuant to this
Agreement (a " **Tax Contest** "); _provided_ , _however_ , no failure or
delay of Parent in providing such notice shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Company Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to
the extent that the Company Stockholders are materially and adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure or delay. Parent shall control any Tax
Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , if a Tax Contest relates to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period which may result in a Tax for which the Indemnifying Parties

 



      
 

 



 

may be liable, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to
participate in (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties), but not control,
such Tax Contest (and Parent shall consider in good faith any comments made by
the Stockholder Representative with respect thereto), and Parent shall be
entitled to settle or compromise such Tax Contest without seeking the
Stockholder Representatives prior written consent; _provided, however_ , that
in the absence of such consent any such settlement shall not be dispositive of
the Company Stockholders liability with respect to such Taxes. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that any conflict arises between the
provisions of this **Section 5.11(c)** and the provisions of **Section 7.7** ,
the provisions of this **Section 5.11(c)** shall govern.

 



 

(d) _Tax Treatment of Escrow_. Parent, the Surviving Entity and the
Stockholder Representative agree for all Tax purposes that: (i) if and to the
extent any portion of the Escrow Amount is actually distributed to the Company
Optionholders in respect of their Company Options, such portion shall be
treated as compensation paid at the time the portion of the Escrow Amount is
actually released to the Company Optionholders and shall be subject to
applicable withholding Tax at such time, (ii) Parent shall be treated as the
owner of the cash portion of the Escrow Amount solely for Tax purposes, all
interest and earnings earned from the investment and reinvestment of the
Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable to Parent pursuant
to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulations Section
1.468B-8,, (iii) if and to the extent any amount of the Escrow Amount that is
paid to the Company Stockholders is actually distributed to the Company
Stockholders in respect of their shares, interest may be imputed on such
amount as required by Section 483 or Section 1274 of the Code, and (iv) in the
event that the total amount of any interest and earnings earned on the portion
of the Escrow Amount that is paid to the Company Stockholders exceeds the
imputed interest, such interest shall be treated as interest or other income
and not as purchase price. Clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is intended
to ensure that the right of the Company Stockholders to the Escrow Amount that
is paid to the Company Stockholders and any interest and earnings earned
thereon is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum
selling price under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. All parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns
consistently with the foregoing.

 



 

(e) _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds (or credits for overpayment) of Taxes,
including any interest received from a Governmental Entity thereon,
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be for the account of the Company Stockholders. Promptly
upon the Surviving Entitys (or any of its Affiliates) receipt of any such
refund (or credit for overpayment), Parent shall pay over, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, any such refund (or the amount of any such
credit), including any interest thereon but net of any Taxes attributable to
the receipt of such refund (or credit for overpayment) or reasonable expenses
incurred by Parent or the Surviving Entity or its subsidiaries in obtaining
such refund (or credit for overpayment), to the Company Stockholders their
respective pro rata share of such amounts. Upon the Stockholder
Representatives written request and at the Company Stockholders expense,
Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause the Surviving Entity to claim
refunds attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period within the statutorily
required time period.

 



 

(f) _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall deliver, no less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to Parent a properly executed
statement (a " **FIRPTA Compliance Certificate** ") in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

 



 

5.12 _Spreadsheet_. The Company shall deliver, not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to Parent a spreadsheet (the "
**Spreadsheet** ") in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, which
spreadsheet shall be certified as complete and correct by the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company (such certification, the " **Spreadsheet Certificate**
") as of the Closing and which shall include, among other things, as of the
Closing:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) with respect to each Company Stockholder, (i) such Persons name, address
and, if available to the Company, email address, (ii) the number of shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such Person, (iii) the respective certificate
number(s) representing such shares, (iv) the respective date(s) of acquisition
of such shares, (v) the Pro Rata Portion applicable to such Person, (vi) the
aggregate amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid to such
Person at the Closing in respect of such shares, (vii) the amount of shares of
Parent Common Stock retained by Parent in respect of the Escrow Amount,
respectively, (viii) any amounts required to be withheld, (ix) the
identification of any shares that were eligible for an election under Section
83(b) of the Code, including the date of issuance of such shares, and whether

5.13 _SEC Filings; Registration Rights_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date but in no event later than
five (5) business days after the Closing Date, Parent shall file a Form S-8
registration statement with the SEC to register the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company Options assumed by Parent as
provided in **Section 1.7**. Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such assumed Company Options remain
outstanding, and shall maintain a sufficient number of reserved shares of
Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of such assumed options.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall file a Form S-3 ASR (or if Form
S-3 ASR is not available for purposes of registering the sale of Registrable
Securities, then on Form S-3 or another appropriate form) registration
statement (the " **Registration Statement** ") with the SEC to register the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the First Merger (the "
**Registrable Securities** "), with such filing to become effective as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than the later of (i) 60 days after the
receipt by Parent of the Required Financials and (ii) the Closing Date,
_provided, however,_ that should Parent determine that the Required Financials
shall not be required for SEC reporting purposes on Form 8-K, then Parent
shall file such Registration Statement with the SEC with such filing to become
effective within 30 days of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to: (i) keep the
Registration Statement effective until the earlier to occur of (A) the date on
which all Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement have
been sold, or (B) the six month anniversary of the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement; (ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments to
the Registration Statement and amendments or supplements to the prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement; (iii) furnish
to each Company Stockholder such number of copies of any prospectus (including
any preliminary prospectus

 



       
 

 



 

and any amended or supplemented prospectus) in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act as each Company Stockholder may reasonably
request in order to effect the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities
to be offered and sold by such Company Stockholder thereunder, but only while
Parent shall be required under the provisions hereof to cause the Registration
Statement to remain effective; (iv) register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under the securities or blue
sky laws of such jurisdictions as each Company Stockholder shall reasonably
request; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be required in connection
therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a
general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction where it has
not been qualified or is not otherwise subject to a general consent for
service of process); (v) in the event of the issuance of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or of any order
suspending or preventing the use of any related prospectus or suspending the
qualification of any Registrable Securities included in the Registration
Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, obtain promptly the withdrawal of such
order; and (vi) list all Registrable Securities included in the Registration
Statement on the New York Stock Exchange.

 



 

(d) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with any registration of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this **Section 5.13**, including all SEC
fees, blue sky registration and filing fees, New York Stock Exchange notices
and filing fees, printing fees and expenses, transfer agents and registrars
fees and expenses, and all reasonable fees and expenses of Parents outside
counsel and independent accountants shall be paid by Parent. Parent shall not
be responsible for any legal fees for any Company Stockholder or any selling
expenses of any Company Stockholder (including any brokers fees or
commissions).

 



 

(e) _Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Company Stockholder, and
each of its directors, officers and employees, and each person controlling
such Company Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act (each, a " **Seller Indemnified Party** "), with respect to which
registration, qualification or compliance has been effected pursuant to this
Agreement, from and against all losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any
litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, the prospectus forming a part thereof or included
therein, and any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such
registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any
violation by Parent of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities
Act or state securities laws applicable to Parent in connection with any such
registration, qualification or compliance, and shall reimburse each Seller
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any lawsuit,
claim or action relating thereto; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
required to indemnify, or otherwise be liable to, any Seller Indemnified Party
to the extent that any such loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of,
or is based on, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement
or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished by or on behalf of any Seller Indemnified Party to Parent
specifically for use therein.

 



 

(ii) If Registrable Securities held by a Company Stockholder are included in
the securities as to which such registration, qualification or compliance is
being effected, such Company Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent, each of its directors, officers and employees, each person controlling
Parent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and Parents
legal counsel and independent accountants, as well as each other Company
Stockholder, each such Company Stockholders directors, officers and
employees, and each person controlling each such other Company

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholders within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (each a "
**Parent Indemnified Party** "), from and against all losses, damages and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of, or based on, any
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement, the prospectus forming a part thereof or included
therein, and any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such
registration, qualification or compliance, or any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by
such Company Stockholder of any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act or state securities laws applicable to such Company Stockholder
in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and
shall reimburse each Parent Indemnified Party for any legal or any other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any
such lawsuit, claim or action relating thereto, in each case to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue
statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration
statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information pertaining solely to such Company
Stockholder, and furnished by such Company Stockholder to Parent specifically
for use therein; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate
amounts payable by any Company Stockholder by way of indemnity under this
**Section 5.13(e)(ii) **exceed the proceeds from the offering received by
such Company Stockholder, except in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by such Company Stockholder.

 



 

(iii) Each party entitled to indemnification under this **Section 5.13(e)
**(the " **Indemnitee** ") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the " **Indemnitor** ") promptly after such Indemnitee has
written notice of any lawsuit, claim or action as to which indemnity may be
sought hereunder, and shall permit the Indemnitor to assume the defense of any
such lawsuit, claim or action; provided, however, that counsel for the
Indemnitor, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall
be approved by the Indemnitee (whose approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Indemnitee may participate in such
defense at such partys expense, and provided further, however, that the
failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent,
but only to the extent, that the Indemnitors ability to defend against such
claim or litigation is materially and adversely impacted by the failure to
give such notice. No Indemnitor, in the defense of any such lawsuit, claim or
action shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to
entry of any judgment or enter any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect to such lawsuit, claim
or action.

 



 

(iv) If the indemnification provided for in this **Section 5.13(e) **is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnitee with
respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein,
then the Indemnitor, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee hereunder, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of
such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnitor on the one hand
and the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that
(i) no contribution by any Company Stockholder, when combined with any amounts
paid by such Company Stockholder pursuant to **Section 5.13(e)(ii)**, shall
exceed the net proceeds from the sale of securities that are included in the
Registration Statement that are received by such Company Stockholder and (ii)
no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The relative
fault of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Indemnitor or by the Indemnitee and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) The obligations of Parent and each Company Stockholder under this
**Section 5.13(e) **shall survive the completion of any offering and sale or
other disposition of Registrable Securities in the Registration Statement
filed with the SEC pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

5.14 _Employment Arrangements._

 



 

(a) _Continuing Employees_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Continuing Employee, Continuing Consultant or
Transitional Employee set forth on **Schedule 5.14** , attached hereto, to
execute and deliver to Parent an offer letter and a confidential information
and invention assignment agreement, in each case on Parents standard form,
effective on the Closing Date. Pursuant to Parents vacation policy, Parent
shall roll over and assume up to 10 days of accrued vacation balances for
Continuing US Employees or Transitional Employees through an express rollover
provision in the form offer letter. Parent shall assume the cost of all
accrued vacation in excess of 10 days per Continuing US Employee or
Transitional Employee, which excess must be cashed out by the Company on the
Closing Date (such excess in the aggregate, the " **Aggregate Excess Vacation
Amount** "). For the avoidance of doubt, the transactions contemplated hereby
shall not require a change in the employment status (including applicable
rules regarding eligibility for the accrual, carrying and use of vacation
balances) of a Continuing Non-US Employee as an employee of the subsidiary of
the Company which is currently the employer of such Continuing Non-US
Employee.

 



 

(b) _Non-Continuing Employees_. Except for the Executive Severance
Obligations, Parent shall assume all monetary and notification obligations,
including, but not limited to, all obligations imposed under the WARN Act, the
California WARN Act or any similar state or local Laws, payment of accrued
vacation, and severance payments associated with the termination of Non-
Continuing Employees (collectively, the " **Non-Continuing Employee Severance
Obligations** "). At the Closing, the Company shall provide all Non-Continuing
Employees severance agreements which shall provide for the satisfaction of all
Non-Continuing Employee Severance Obligations subject to the effectiveness of
a release of claims. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each of the individuals set forth on **Schedule 5.14(g) **to execute
and deliver to the Company a Confirmatory Document.

 



 

5.15 _Joinder Agreement_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall have used all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Joinder Agreement in the forms attached hereto as **_Exhibit F-1_** and
**_Exhibit F-2_** (the " **Joinder Agreement** "), as applicable, to be
executed on or prior to the Closing Date by each of the Company Stockholders.

 



 

5.16 _Employment Arrangements_. Following the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall either (i) be eligible
to continue to participate in the Surviving Entitys health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Companys health and welfare benefit plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time) or (ii) be eligible to participate in
substantially similar plans or arrangements of Parent to the same extent as
similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries, as applicable);
_provided, however,_ that (i) nothing in this **Section 5.16** or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Entity to
amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at any time and
(ii) if Parent or the Surviving Entity terminates any such health or welfare
benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate
in the Surviving Entitys health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that
coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time or to the extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent and its subsidiaries, as applicable. To the extent that service is
relevant for eligibility to participate in, but not for purpose of

 



      
 

 



 

benefit accrual under, any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the
Surviving Entity, then Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee
benefit plan in which such employees participated prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes
of eligibility, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums, credit
Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time
with the Company to the same extent that such service and amounts paid was
recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or
welfare benefit plan of the Company. Nothing in this **Section 5.16** or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Affiliate of the Surviving Entity and the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this **Section 5.16** are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this **Section 5.16** is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the
Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



 

5.17 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company_.

 



 

(a) Indemnification Obligations. During the period ending six (6) years after
the Effective Time, the First-Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity
or their respective successors shall, and Parent shall cause the First-Step
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or their respective successors to,
fulfill their obligations to the present and former members of the Companys
Board of Directors and present and former officers of the Company (such
directors and officers being herein called the " **Company Indemnitees** ")
pursuant to the terms of the Charter Documents and the indemnification
agreements listed in **Schedule 5.17** (the " **Indemnification Schedule** ")
as in effect on the date hereof. Any claims for indemnification made under
this **Section 5.17** on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of Parent and the First-Step
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or their respective successors (i)
shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law and (ii) shall
not be deemed to release any Company Indemnitee who is also an officer or
director of the Company or its subsidiaries from his or her obligations
pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement.

 



 

(b) Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase and
fully pay (and such purchase price shall be included in Third Party Expenses
of the Company) for an extended reporting period endorsement under the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent that shall provide the Company
Indemnitees with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of
not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially less
favorable to the insured persons than the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company (the " **D andO
Tail Policy**"). Parent shall not, and shall cause the First-Step Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Entity to not, take any action to eliminate such
DandO Tail Policy.

 



 

(c) In the event that the First-Step Surviving Corporation or Surviving Entity
or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer or convey all or
substantially all of their properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of the First-Step Surviving Corporation or

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this **Section 5.17**.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this **Section 5.17** shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this
**Section 5.17** applies without the consent of such affected Company
Indemnitee, it being understood and agreed that the Company Indemnitees are
intended to be express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

 



 

5.18 _Retention Loan Agreement_. The Company shall forgive the remaining
installment of the Retention Loan Agreement prior to the Closing Date and
shall provide to Parent reasonable evidence thereof.

 _ARTICLE VII_

 



 

 _SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; 
INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW_

 



 

7.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement and in the Certificates shall survive for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such twelve
(12) month period, the " **Survival Date** "), except to the extent subject to
a pending claim for indemnification set forth in an Officers Certificate
delivered prior to the termination of the Escrow Period, in which case the
representation and warranty subject to such claim shall survive solely for
such purpose until the final resolution thereof in accordance with this
**Article VII**; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by the Company of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or in the Certificates, as applicable, such
representation or warranty shall not terminate on the Survival Date, but shall
survive until the expiration

 



      
 

 



 

of the statute of limitations applicable thereto; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that the representations and warranties contained in **Section
2.1(a) **(Organization of the Company), **Section 2.2** (Company Capital
Structure), **Section 2.4** (Authority and Enforceability) and **Section
2.10 **(Tax Matters) hereof and the certificate delivered pursuant to

by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto, until the expiration of the
statutes of limitations (including any extensions or waivers thereof)
applicable to any such representations and warranties hereof. The covenants of
the Company shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and shall constitute " **Fundamental Matters** " for purposes of
this Agreement. The representations and warranties of Parent contained in this
Agreement, the Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive for a period of twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival periods
and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations that
would otherwise apply to such representations and warranties and the right to
make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement, and the
Indemnifying Parties hereby waive any defenses based on the statute of
limitations to the extent inconsistent with the survival periods set forth
herein.

 



 

7.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) By virtue of the First Merger, subject to the provisions of this **Article
VII**, from and after the consummation of the First Merger, each Company
Stockholder and each Non-Continuing Employee holding Vested Company Options as

" and, collectively, the " **Indemnifying Parties** ") agree to severally (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions) and not jointly indemnify
and hold harmless Parent and its officers, directors and affiliates, including
the Company (the " **Indemnified Parties** "), against all losses,
liabilities, damages, Taxes, diminution in value (to the extent determined to
be an appropriate measure of damages under the circumstances), costs,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys and consultants fees and
expenses and including any such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with investigating, defending against or settling (in accordance
with this **Article VII**) any of the foregoing (hereinafter individually a "
**Loss** " and collectively " **Losses** ") incurred or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Company), to the extent as
a result of the following (the " **Indemnifiable Matters** "):

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement or in the Certificates;

 



 

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement applicable to it contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes that have not already been reflected in the
calculation of the Total Consideration, as determined in accordance with
**Section 1.9**.

 



 

(iv) any Excess Consideration, Working Capital Deficiency or Closing Cash
Deficiency that was not reflected in the calculation of the Total
Consideration, in each case, as determined in accordance with **Section 1.9
**and **Section 1.10**;

 



 

(v) any inaccuracy or omission in the Spreadsheet, including any amounts set
forth therein that are paid to a Person in excess of the amounts such Person
is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any amounts
a Person was entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that
was omitted from the Spreadsheet;

 



       
 

 



 

(vi) any Liabilities arising out of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code;

 



 

(vii) (A) any fraud committed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
(B) any intentional misrepresentation related to this Agreement, any
Certificate, the Spreadsheet or other instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement committed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and

 



 

(viii) any Dissenting Share Payments.

 



 

(b) Except with respect to the indemnification provided under **Section
7.2(a)(vii)**, and subject to the limitations applicable thereto, no
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party (i) for the breach
by any other Indemnifying Party of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of such other Indemnifying Party set forth in this Agreement,
in any Certificate or in any agreement entered into in connection with this
Agreement, or (ii) for fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by any
other Person.

 



 

(c) For the purposes of this **Article VII** only, solely when determining
the amount of Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
breach, inaccuracy or failure (but not as to whether such breach, inaccuracy
or failure has occurred), any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
given or made by the Company that is qualified or limited in scope as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect, such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall be deemed to be made or given without such
qualification or limitation.

 



 

(d) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Company, the First-Step
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or Parent in their capacity as
Company Stockholders or Company Optionholders with respect to any Loss claimed
by an Indemnified Party against such Indemnifying Party that is determined to
be indemnifiable hereunder.

 



 

(e) This **Article VII** shall constitute the exclusive remedy after the
Closing for recovery of Losses by the Indemnified Parties pursuant to and in
connection with this Agreement; provided, that notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary other than the limitations set forth in **Section 7.3**,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party (i) in connection with fraud or intentional
misrepresentation (provided that, any claims for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation may be asserted solely against the Person who allegedly
committed such fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and no other
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any such matters committed by any other
Person except with respect to the indemnification provided under **Section
7.2(a)(vii)**, (ii) to specific performance or injunctive relief or (iii) to
pursue remedies under any Related Agreement (other than the Certificates)
against the parties thereto.

 



 

7.3 _Maximum Payments; Remedy; Other Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Indemnified
Parties may not recover for indemnification under **Section 7.2(a)(i) **for
breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in the Certificates (other than for breaches of the
Fundamental Matters) until such time as the cumulative amount of all Losses
that may be claimed under **Section 7.2(a)(i) **exceeds $5,000,000 (the "
**Threshold** "), at which time the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover in accordance with this Agreement all such Losses, including those
that comprised any portion of the Threshold.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
claims for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for Losses pursuant to this
Agreement shall be satisfied (i) first, from the Escrow Amount and (ii)
second, to the extent permitted under, and subject to the limitations of, this
**Section 7.3**, against the Indemnifying Parties directly, not exceeding
such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such Losses (subject to the
limitations contained herein), but only to the extent that such Losses cannot
be recovered from the Escrow Amount, _provided, however_ , if claims with
respect to Special Matters are recovered from and thereby reduce the Escrow
Amount, claims that are not Special Matters and that would otherwise be
limited to recovery of the Escrow Amount may, to the extent not recoverable
from any then remaining Escrow Amount, instead be recovered to the extent of
the amount of such reduction(s) (but still subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations of this **Article VII**, and when viewed in the aggregate
with all claims that are not Special Matters, up to a cap equal to the Escrow
Amount prior to any reduction thereof) from the respective Indemnifying
Parties (severally and not jointly in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Portions); _provided, further_ , that claims for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation may, at Parents discretion, be asserted directly against
the Indemnifying Person(s) who committed such fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, except as set forth in the following sentence,
recourse of Parent and the other Indemnified Parties to the Escrow Amount
pursuant to this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and the other Indemnified Parties for recovery of Losses under the
indemnification provisions contained in **Section 7.2(a)(i)**.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Escrow Amount shall not be the exclusive remedy, in respect of Losses (A)
arising out of the Indemnifiable Matters described in **Section 7.2(a)(ii)
**through **7.2(a)(viii) **or (B) with respect to any Fundamental Matter
(such matters, collectively, the " **Special Matters** "), in which case the
liability of the Indemnifying Parties under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B)
shall be several (in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions) and not joint
and, subject to **Section 7.3(a)**, the maximum amount that the Indemnified
Parties may recover from each Indemnifying Party for all Losses under this
**Article VII** shall be limited to an amount equal to the portion of the
Total Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to
**Section 1.7** (inclusive of the Escrow Amount).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this **Article VII** shall limit the Liability of any party
hereto for any knowing and willful breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, any Certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement if the First Merger does not close.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement but
subject to the Disclosure Schedule, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that Parent on behalf of any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this **Article VII **notwithstanding the
fact that such Indemnified Party had knowledge or notice of the breach, event
or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement: (i)
no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under this **Article
VII** for punitive or exemplary damages unless such damages are awarded in
connection with a Third Party Claim for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this **Article VII**; (ii) Losses shall be
calculated net of actual recoveries received by or on behalf of Parent or the
Surviving Entity under insurance policies (net of any actual costs of recovery
or collection, deductibles, retroactive premium adjustments, reimbursement
obligations or other costs directly related to the insurance claim and
deductibles); _provided_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall
have any obligation hereunder to take any action to obtain such payments or to
obtain or maintain any such insurance policies (except as

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated in **Section 5.17(b)**), and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly refund any amount it actually receives (net of costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the collection of such amount) pursuant to this
clause (ii) from insurance to the extent that it actually receives such amount
after payment by any Indemnifying Party; (iii) each Indemnified Partys sole
remedy for Losses with respect to Taxes (including, but not limited to,
breaches of a representation or warranty contained in **Section 2.10** ( _Tax
Matters_ ) or otherwise) shall be limited to Taxes of the Company and its
subsidiaries attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_
, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to (A) Taxes attributable to a
breach of a representation or warranty contained in **Sections 2.10(b)(ix),
2.10(b)(x), 2.10(b)(xi), 2.10(b)(xii) **or **2.10(b)(xiii), Section 2.10(c),
Section 2.10(d) **and the third sentence of **Section 2.2(a)** or (B) any
interest, penalties or additions to Tax that are attributable to a taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date, but that relate to Taxes of the
Company or its subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (iv) neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or warranty
regarding, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Losses arising in
a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date from, the amount, value or
condition of, or any limitations on, any Tax asset or attribute of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, including but not limited to net operating losses,
(each, a " **Tax Attribute** "), or the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity) to utilize such Tax Attributes
after the Closing.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if and solely to the extent the amount of
any Loss is recovered by an Indemnified Party through the actual payment to
such Indemnified Party, the same amount of such Loss may not be recovered
again by such Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss being subject to
indemnification under more than one provision of this Agreement and (ii) if
and solely to the extent that any Loss in connection with an Indemnifiable
Matter was reflected or reserved against in the Current Balance Sheet or was
specifically taken into account in connection with calculations of the Net
Working Capital or Specified Pre-Closing Liabilities, the same amount of such
Loss may not be recovered under this **Article VII**, but, in the case of the
immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the amount, if any, of Loss that
exceeds the amount already recovered under clause (i) or already taken into
account under clause (ii) shall be recoverable on and subject to the terms and
conditions of this **Article VII**.

 



 

7.4 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_

 



 

(a) _Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer s Certificate_.

 



 

(i) Parent (on behalf of itself and/or any other Indemnified Parties) may seek
recovery of Losses pursuant to this **Article VII **by delivering to the
Stockholder Representative (and, in the case of recovery sought directly from
one or more Indemnifying Parties directly, delivering to such Indemnifying
Party with a copy to the Stockholder Representative) an Officers Certificate
in respect of such claim. The date of such delivery of an Officers
Certificate is referred to herein as the " **Claim Date** " of such Officers
Certificate (and the claims for indemnification contained therein). For
purposes hereof, " **Officer s Certificate**" shall mean a certificate signed
by any officer of Parent: (A) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
sustained or incurred, or is reasonably likely to pay, sustain or incur,
Losses and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the Indemnifiable Matter to
which such item is related, which if the Loss claimed is pursuant to **Section
7.2(a)(i) **shall reference the specific representations and warranties
applicable to such Loss. Following the delivery of an Officers Certificate,
the Stockholder Representative and its representatives and agents shall be
given all such access (including electronic access, to the extent available)
as they may reasonably require to the books and records of the Surviving
Entity and reasonable access during normal business hours to such personnel or
representatives of the Surviving Entity and Parent, including but not limited
to the individuals responsible for the matters that are the subject of the

 



      
 

 



 

Officers Certificate, as they may reasonably require for the purposes of
investigating or resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or
inquiries raised in the Officers Certificate.

 



 

(ii) In the event that Parent pursues a claim directly against any
Indemnifying Party and it is determined hereunder that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification of a Loss pursuant to this **Article VII**,
subject to the provisions of **Section 7.3** , **Section 7.4(b) **and
**Section 7.4(c) **hereof, each such Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and
in no event later than thirty (30) days after delivery of an Officers
Certificate to such Indemnifying Party, wire transfer to the Indemnified Party
an amount of cash equal to the amount of the Loss.

 



 

(b) _Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) The Stockholder Representative (or, in the case of a claim directly
against one or more Indemnifying Parties, such Indemnifying Parties) may
object to a claim for indemnification set forth in an Officers Certificate by
delivering to Parent a written statement of objection to the claim made in the
Officers Certificate (an " **Objection Notice** "), _provided_ that, to be
effective, such Objection Notice must (i) be delivered to Parent prior to
midnight (California time) on the thirtieth (30th) day following the Claim
Date of the Officers Certificate (such deadline, the " **Objection Deadline**
" for such Officers Certificate and the claims for indemnification contained
therein) and (ii) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections
to the claims in respect of which the objection is made.

 



 

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, in the
event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party) does not object in writing (as provided in **Section
7.4(b)(i)**) to the claims contained in an Officers Certificate prior to the
Objection Deadline for such Officers Certificate, such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and
the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate (and
such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) (any such
claim, an " **Unobjected Claim** ").

 



 

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Stockholder Representative (or the
Indemnifying Parties in the case of a claim for indemnification sought
directly from an Indemnifying Party) timely delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with **Section 7.4(b)(i) **hereof, the Stockholder Representative
(or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent shall attempt in good faith
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims. Either party may, but shall not be obligated to, initiate non-
binding mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral arbitrator
belonging to and under the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution.
The party requesting the mediation shall arrange for mediation services,
subject to the approval of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Mediation shall take place in Santa Clara County, California during
reasonable business hours and upon reasonable advance notice. Mediation may be
scheduled to begin at any time, but with at least ten (10) Business Days
written notice to all parties. If one party initiates mediation, the parties
(i) shall participate in the mediation in good faith and shall devote
reasonable time and energy to the mediation so as to promptly resolve the
dispute or conclude that they cannot resolve the dispute and (ii) shall not
pursue other remedies while such mediation is proceeding. If the Stockholder
Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Parties) and Parent reach an
agreement, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim directly against the
Indemnifying Parties, to the Indemnifying Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

7.5 _Escrow Arrangements_

 



 

(a) _Escrow Amount_. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for
the indemnity obligations provided for in **Section 7.2 **hereof, at the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount
without any act of the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with **Section 1.7
**and this **Article VII**. The Escrow Amount shall be available to
compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any
Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to
recovery under this **Article VII**. Release of any portion of the Escrow
Amount to Parent in respect of any Losses determined to be indemnifiable under
this **Article VII** shall reduce the portion of the remaining Escrow Amount
attributable to each of the Indemnifying Parties in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining Escrow Amount, if any, and out
of each such Indemnifying Partys portion of the Escrow Cash and Escrow Stock
in the same proportion as such Escrow Cash and Escrow Stock was deposited in
the Escrow Account with respect to such Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period_. At 5:00
p.m., local time on the Survival Date (the " **Escrow Period** "), the Escrow
Agent shall distribute or cause to be distributed, the remaining portion of
the Escrow Amount, if any, to the Indemnifying Parties; _provided, however_ ,
that the Escrow Amount will not terminate with respect to the amount
reasonably necessary to serve as security (which, with respect to any Third
Party Claim, shall be no less than the amount claimed by the third party
claimant in the Third Party Claim) for any then unresolved claims specified in
any Officers Certificate (" **Unresolved Claims** ") delivered to the Escrow
Agent and Stockholder Representative prior to the Escrow Period termination
date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Survival
Date, and any such amount shall not be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties
at such time. As soon as each Unresolved Claim is resolved, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Parties the remaining portion of the Escrow
Amount, if any, not required to satisfy any remaining Unresolved Claims.
Deliveries of the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount to the Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to this **Section 7.5(b) **shall be made in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining portion of the Escrow
Amount, if any, with the amount delivered to each Indemnifying Party rounded
to the nearest whole share (with a fractional share of 0.5 and above rounded
up), and with the proportion of Escrow Cash and Escrow Stock distributed in
such release to each Indemnifying Person adjusted to ensure that any
Indemnifying Party who is an Unaccredited Stockholder receives the Pro Rata
Portion of the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount attributable to such
Unaccredited Stockholder exclusively in cash (but excluding any adjustment
for, and any Indemnifying Party who is an Unaccredited Stockholder shall not
receive any portion of, any cash proceeds resulting from a sale of Escrow
Shares pursuant to **Section 7.8(e)**).

 



 

7.6 _Escrow Shares_. Each Accredited Stockholder shall deliver two copies of
an Assignment Separate from Certificate in the form attached hereto as
**_Exhibit C_**, each in blank, to the Secretary of Parent, or the
Secretarys designee, to hold such Assignment Separate from Certificate, along
with the certificate(s) evidencing such Accredited Stockholders Escrow Shares
(if such shares are certificated), in escrow and to take all such actions and
to effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as are in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The applicable Accredited Stockholder will be shown
as the registered owner of its Escrow Shares on the certificate(s) evidencing
such Escrow Shares (if such shares are certificated) and on the books and
records of Parent and shall have all rights with respect to its Escrow Shares
during the period of time in which such shares have not been transferred or
forfeited and are retained by Parent (including, without limitation, the right
to vote such shares and the right to receive on a current basis any cash
dividends or other distributions made with respect to such Escrow Shares),
except the right of possession or transfer thereof. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that each applicable Accredited
Stockholder is the owner of the Escrow Shares issued to such Accredited
Stockholder. Any Escrow Shares that are distributed to satisfy any claims for
Losses suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties, and for which they are
entitled to recovery pursuant to the terms of this **Article VII**, shall be
valued at the Parent Trading Price.

 



      
 

 



 

7.7 _Third Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a " **Third Party Claim** ") which Parent reasonably believes may
result in a reduction of the Escrow Amount or other indemnification pursuant
to this **Article VII**, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative
(or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such claim within a reasonable
time (which such notice shall include a summary in reasonable detail of the
basis of the Third Party Claim and a reasonable estimate of the Losses arising
therefrom), and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties (or, in the event indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled), at their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim. The failure to so notify the
Stockholder Representative within a reasonable time shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Parties of any liability, except to the extent and only to the
extent the Stockholder Representative demonstrates that the defense of such
action is prejudiced thereby. If there is a Third Party Claim that, if
adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for Losses
hereunder, then 60% of any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Parties in
defense of such Third Party Claim shall be deemed Losses indemnifiable in
accordance with this **Article VII** and 40% of any amounts incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in defense of such Third Party Claim shall not be Losses
hereunder and shall be borne by the Indemnified Parties, in each case,
regardless of the ultimate disposition of the Third Party Claim. Parent shall
have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to
settle, any such claim; _provided, however,_ that, in the event that the
consent of the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is
being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying
Party) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) is not
obtained, no such settlement of any such Third Party Claim shall be
determinative of the existence or amount of Losses relating to such matter or
whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
**Article VII**, unless it is determined that such consent was unreasonably
withheld by the Stockholder Representative, in which case, indemnifiable
Losses shall include reasonable amounts paid in settlement (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include unreasonable amounts paid in
settlement); _provided further, however,_ that the consent of the Stockholder
Representative with respect to any such settlement of any such Third Party
Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the Stockholder Representative
shall have objected within thirty (30) days after a written request for such
consent by Parent. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has
consented to any such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power
or authority to object under any provision of this **Article VII** to the
amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent against the Escrow Amount, or
against the Indemnifying Parties directly, as the case may be, with respect to
such settlement.

 



 

7.8 _Stockholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) Shareholder Representative Services LLC is hereby appointed as the
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties for all purposes under this Agreement and the agreements
ancillary hereto, including to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such payments, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) permitted by the terms of this
Agreement. The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time upon at least
ten (10) days prior written notice to the Indemnifying Parties. Such agency
may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less
than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that
the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless the former holders of
a majority of Company Capital Stock agree to such removal and to the identity
of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the former holders of a majority of Company
Capital Stock. No bond shall be required of the

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

 



 

(b) Neither the Stockholder Representative nor any member of the Advisory
Committee (as defined in that certain engagement letter entered into between
the Stockholder Representative and certain of the Indemnifying Parties in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " **Engagement
Letter** ")) will incur liability of any kind with respect to any action or
omission by the Stockholder Representative or the Advisory Committee in
connection with their services pursuant to this Agreement, the Engagement
Letter and the agreements ancillary hereto, except to the extent resulting
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative or such member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable. For
the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not prejudice the
Stockholder Representatives right to indemnification from the members of the
Advisory Committee (in their capacity as Indemnifying Parties) pursuant to the
following sentence. The Indemnifying Parties will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Stockholder Representative and each member of the Advisory
Committee from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, " **Representative Losses** ") to the extent
arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representatives or the
Advisory Committees execution and performance of this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been caused by the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative or such
member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable, the Stockholder
Representative or such member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable, will
promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Representative Losses may
be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Expense Fund, (ii) the Escrow Amount at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties, and (iii) the Escrow
Shares at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to
the Indemnifying Parties; provided, that while this section allows the
Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund, the Escrow Amount
and the Escrow Shares, this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from
their obligation to promptly pay, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions, such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal
of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire to the Stockholder Representative
an amount of $1,000,000.00 in cash (the " **Expense Fund** "), which will be
used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholder
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto. The Indemnifying Parties will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a
result of its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable after the
completion of the Stockholder Representatives responsibilities, the
Stockholder Representative will deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to
Parent or

 



      
 

 



 

Parents paying agent for further distribution to the Indemnifying Parties.
For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Parties at the time of Closing.

 



 

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative,
including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to **Section 8.3** and **Section 8.4** hereof, shall
constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties. Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties.
Parent is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(e) From time to time following the Closing, the Stockholder Representative
may instruct the Escrow Agent by written notice (with copy to Parent) to sell
shares of Parent Common Stock then comprising Escrow Shares, and the proceeds
of such sale shall be deposited in the Escrow Amount to constitute partial
security for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any
indemnifiable Losses under this **Article VII**; _provided_ that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be permitted to so instruct the Escrow
Agent at any time that the price of Parent Common Stock as reported on NYSE is
below the Parent Trading Price. Upon consummation of such sale, the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent a written confirmation of
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock so sold and the amount of cash so
deposited in the Escrow Amount, and the Stockholder Representative shall
update the Spreadsheet for (i) the aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock then in the Escrow Amount and (ii) the
allocation of such cash and stock with respect to each Indemnifying Party
(with proceeds of any sale of Escrow Shares pursuant to this **Section 7.8(e)
**to be allocated pro rata among the Indemnifying Parties in proportion to the
number of Escrow Shares attributable to each Indemnifying Party).

 



 

7.9 _Tax Treatment_. Any payment under **Article VII** of this Agreement
(other than **Section 7.8(c)**) shall be treated by the parties for U.S.
federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes as a purchase price
adjustment unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

 _ARTICLE VIII_

(b) by Parent or the Company if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by
August 9, 2015 (the " **End Date** "); _provided, however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this **Section 8.1(b) **shall not be available
to any party whose action or failure to act has been a proximate cause of or
resulted in the failure of the First Merger to occur on or before such date
and such action or failure to act constitutes breach of this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by Parent if the Stockholder Written Consent is not delivered to Parent
within two (2) hours following the exchange of signature pages by Parent,
Merger Subs and the Company;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted,

in effect and which has the effect of making the First Merger illegal;

 



 

(e) by Parent if there shall be any statute, rule, regulation or order
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the First Merger by any
Governmental Entity, which would constitute an Action of Divestiture;

 



 

(f) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in **Section 6.2(a) **would not be satisfied and such
breach has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice thereof to the Company; _provided, however_ , that no cure period shall
be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event
shall the cure period extend past the End Date; or

 



 

(g) by the Company if the Company is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Sub I contained in this Agreement
such that the conditions set forth in **Section 6.3(a) **would not be
satisfied and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days
after written notice thereof to Parent; _provided, however_ , that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured and
in no event shall the cure period extend past the End Date.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in **Section 8.1** hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no Liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the
Company, or its officers, directors or stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the knowing and
willful breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that occurred prior to such termination; and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that, the provisions of **Section 5.2
**(Confidentiality), **Section** **5.3** (Public Disclosure), **Section
5.10** (Expenses), **Section 7.3** (Maximum Payments; Remedy), **Section
7.8(b) **(Stockholder Representative), **Article IX** (General Provisions)
and this **Section 8.2** hereof shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this
**Article VIII**.

 



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of the party against whom enforcement is sought, except that an
amendment made subsequent to approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company shall not (a) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration
to be received on conversion of Company Capital Stock or (b) alter or change
any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change
would materially and adversely affect the holders of Company Capital Stock.
For purposes of this **Section 8.3**, the Indemnifying Parties agree that any
amendment of this Agreement signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be
binding upon and effective against the Indemnifying Parties whether or not
they have signed such amendment, except that any amendment made in accordance
with this sentence shall not (1) alter or change the amount or kind of
consideration to be received on conversion of Company Capital Stock or (2)
alter or change any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if such
alteration or change would materially and adversely affect the stockholders of
the Company immediately before the Effective Time.

 



 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed,
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes of
this **Section 8.4**, the Indemnifying Parties agree that any extension or
waiver signed by the Company prior to Closing shall be binding upon and
effective against all Indemnifying Parties whether or not they have signed
such extension or waiver.

9.2 _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith"
and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Article, section, paragraph, Exhibit and schedule references are to
the articles, sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and schedules of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified. The meaning assigned to each term defined herein
shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such
term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. A reference to
any specific legislation or to any provision of any legislation shall include
any amendment to, and any modification or re-enactment thereof, any
legislative provision substituted therefor and all regulations and statutory
instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto. Dollar thresholds shall not
be indicative of what is material or create any standard with respect to any
determination of a "Material Adverse Effect."

 



 

9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually
executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. A facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement may
be executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party by
facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the
Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced
herein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, (ii) except as set forth in **Section 5.17** are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, and
(iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that
Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its
affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents
obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with

 



      
 

 



 

a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



 

9.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity and the parties
hereby agree to waive any requirements for posting a bond in connection with
any such action.

 



 

9.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

9.8 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof; provided that the Mergers shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware. Subject to **Section 4.2** and **Section
7.4(c)** hereof, each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within Santa Clara County, State
of California, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
California for such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead
any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and
such process. Subject to **Section 7.4(c) **hereof, each party agrees not to
commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts.

 



 

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 



 

9.10 _Waiver of Representations; Disclaimer_. Except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, Parent acknowledges that (a) none of the Company nor any
other Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as
to the Company, the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Subs and their
representatives, including any internal budgets, plans, projections or
forecasts for any period made by or on behalf of the Company of any kind or
nature, or any other matter related to the transactions contemplated herein,
and (b) Parent and Merger Subs have not relied on any representation or
warranty from the Company or any other Person in determining to enter into
this Agreement; provided, however, that that the foregoing shall not be
construed to prohibit or limit a claim for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation against the Person who committed such fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

 



 

9.11 _Privileged Information; Conflicts._ Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that Goodwin Procter LLP (" **Goodwin** ") has acted
as counsel to the Company in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Parent hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company to
consent and agree to, Goodwin representing the Stockholder Representative
and/or any of the Indemnifying Parties (collectively, the " **Seller Parties**
") after the Closing, including with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse
to Parent and its Affiliates (including Parent, the Company, the First-Step
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Entity) (collectively, the " **Parent
Parties** "), and even though Goodwin may have represented the Company in a
matter substantially related to any such dispute. Parent further consents and
agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company to consent and agree to, the
communication by Goodwin to the Seller Parties in connection with any such
representation of any fact known to Goodwin arising by reason of Goodwins
prior representation of the Company.

 



 

(c) In connection with the foregoing, Parent hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Company to irrevocably waive and
not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i)
Goodwins prior representation of the Company and (ii) Goodwins
representation of the Seller Parties prior to and after the Closing.

 



 

(d) Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Goodwin, the Company, any of the Seller
Parties, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or other
representatives that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
communications related to the preparation of the Disclosure Schedule) or,
beginning on the date of this Agreement, any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the " **Deal Communications** ") shall be deemed to
be retained and owned collectively by the Seller Parties, shall be controlled
by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and
shall not pass to or be owned by Parent Parties. All Deal Communications that
are attorney-client privileged (the " **Privileged Deal Communications** ")
shall remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
Stockholder Representative and the Indemnifying Parties, shall be controlled
by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and,
except as provided below, shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent Parties.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Seller
Parties, on the other hand, Parent may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party or
waive such privilege if desired in connection with resolving such dispute. In
the event that Parent is legally required or requested by governmental order
or otherwise (any such request or order, a " **Legal Request** ") to access or
obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, Parent
shall be entitled to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged
Communications to the extent necessary to comply with any such Legal Request.
In the event of any Legal Request, Parent shall promptly notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing (prior to the disclosure by Parent of
any Privileged Communications to the extent practicable) so that the
Stockholder Representative can seek a protective order and Parent agrees to
use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole cost and expense of the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) to assist
therewith.
