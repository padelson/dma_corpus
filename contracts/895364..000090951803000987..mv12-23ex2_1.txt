                     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 22, 2003
(this "Agreement"), by and among Rex Corner Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Parent"), Rex Corner Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Duane
Reade Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                                    RECITALS

                     (a) The respective boards of directors of Merger Sub and
the Company have approved and declared advisable, and the board of directors of
Parent has approved, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

                     (b) Subject to certain exceptions, by virtue of the Merger,
all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") will be converted into the
right to receive $17.00 in cash per share, without interest.

                     (c) The board of directors of the Company has determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company's
unaffiliated stockholders and has agreed to recommend that the Company's
stockholders adopt this Agreement.

                     (d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Anthony J. Cuti ("AJC") has entered into an employment agreement (the
"AJC Agreement") with Merger Sub, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger.

                     (e) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement have
the meanings specified in Section 8.1.

                     Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                  THE MERGER

                     Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, (a) Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, (b) the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its corporate existence
under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving

<PAGE>
Corporation") and (c) the Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.

                     Section 1.2 Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the offices of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York, at 10:00 a.m. as expeditiously as possible but no later than five (5)
Business Days after the day on which the last of such conditions (other than any
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) is satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other place and time
or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

                     Section 1.3 Effective Time. Concurrently with the Closing,
Parent and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be executed, signed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other subsequent
date or time as Parent and the Company may agree in writing and specify in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL. The time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

                     Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
including Section 259 thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

                     Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall, at the Effective Time, be
amended and restated in accordance with Exhibit A attached hereto (the
"Surviving Charter") until amended in accordance with the Surviving Charter and
applicable Laws.

                     Section 1.6 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Bylaws") until
amended in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and
applicable Laws.

                     Section 1.7 Directors. The parties shall take all requisite
action so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter,
the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL.

                     Section 1.8 Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL.

                                    ARTICLE II

                      EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

                     Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub or the Company:

                     (a) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

                     (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Excluded Shares")
shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist, without payment of
any consideration being made in respect thereof.

                     (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares of Company
Common Stock are hereinafter referred to each, as a "Share" and collectively, as
the "Shares"), shall be converted into the right to receive $17.00 in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all Shares
shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
(the "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Shares,
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without any interest
being payable thereon) upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with
Section 2.2.

                     Section 2.2 Surrender of Certificates.

                     (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
(i) select a bank or trust company to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the
"Paying Agent") and (ii) enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, the
terms and conditions of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company
and Parent.

                                       3
<PAGE>
                     (b) Payment Fund. Promptly following the Effective Time on
the Closing Date, Parent shall provide funds to the Paying Agent in amounts
necessary for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable under
Section 2.1(c) upon surrender of the Certificates. Such funds provided to the
Paying Agent are referred to herein as the "Payment Fund."

                     (c) Payment Procedures.

                     (i) Letter of Transmittal. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (A)
a letter of transmittal in customary form, specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and (B) instructions for
surrendering the Certificates.

                     (ii) Surrender of Certificates. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or such agent or agents as
Parent may designate, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
any other documents required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Certificate less any required
withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.2(e). Any Certificates so
surrendered shall be cancelled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid
on any amount payable upon surrender of the Certificates.

                     (iii) Unregistered Transferees. If any Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a
transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer taxes or (2)
establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that
such taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

                     (iv) No Other Rights. Until surrendered in accordance with
this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate shall be deemed, except as provided in
this Agreement or by applicable Law, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof. Payment of the Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of any Certificate shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that Certificate and the
Shares formerly represented by it.

                     (d) No Further Transfers. Upon and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be
no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in this
Article II.

                                       4
<PAGE>
                     (e) Required Withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger
Consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under (i) the Code or (ii) any applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

                     (f) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount
properly paid from the Payment Fund or delivered to a public official under any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

                     (g) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall be deemed property of, and shall be paid
promptly to, Parent. Any losses resulting from such investment shall not in any
way diminish Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay the full
amount of the Merger Consideration.

                     (h) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment
Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Certificates who has not complied with
this Article II shall look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Certificates
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, on the Business Day
immediately prior to such date become the property of Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

                     (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any
Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such form and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such Person
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

                     Section 2.3 Stock Options.

                     (a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as
of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Company Stock Option") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of that Company Stock Option, shall be cancelled and converted into the


                                       5
<PAGE>
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (x) the Option
Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable by its terms). "Option Merger Consideration" means the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price
of the applicable Company Stock Option. The payment of the Option Merger
Consideration to the holder of a Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any
income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code or (ii) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option. At the
Effective Time, all Company Stock Options shall be cancelled and all Company
Option Plans shall terminate. On the Closing Date, Parent shall provide funds to
the Company in amounts necessary for the payment of the aggregate Option Merger
Consideration under this Section 2.3(a) which amounts shall be paid to the
holders of Company Stock Options as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date. The Company shall take all actions to ensure that the Company
Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time. All administrative and
other rights and authorities granted under any Company Option Plan to the
Company, the board of directors of the Company or any committee or designee
thereof, shall, following the Effective Time, reside with the Surviving
Corporation.

                     (b) The Company shall take all reasonable actions required
to qualify for the exemption contemplated by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act
for the treatment of the Company Stock Options contemplated hereby, including,
if necessary or appropriate, obtaining the approval of the Company's board of
directors, of the type described in a pertinent SEC no-action letter dated
January 12, 1999.

                     Section 2.4 Dissenting Shares.

                     (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any Shares for which the holder thereof has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and has demanded the appraisal of such
Shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, Section 262 of
the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c). At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist and the holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only
to such rights as may be granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL.

                     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if
any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal
rights (through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then
such holder's shares (i) shall be deemed not to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the


                                       6
<PAGE>
Certificate representing such shares in accordance with Section 2.2. Parent
shall promptly provide funds to the Paying Agent in amounts necessary for the
payment of the Merger Consideration to such holders,

                     (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, the withdrawals of
such demands, any other instrument served on the Company under the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL and any other matters relating to such demands, and (ii)
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not
settle, offer to settle or make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent.

                     Section 2.5 Adjustments. If during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
Shares shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the price per
share to be paid to holders of Shares in the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted.

jurisdiction where the character of the Company Assets owned, leased or operated

a significant role in such disclosure controls and procedures.

consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of their respective dates and their consolidated results of operations,

whether accrued, contingent, absolute, inchoate or otherwise, whether due or to
become due and whether known or unknown (collectively, "Liabilities"), of the

marketable title to, or a valid and enforceable leasehold interest in, all
Company Assets (other than the Real Property) owned, used or held for use by

any of its Subsidiaries' ownership of or leasehold interest in any such Company
Asset is subject to any Liens, except for Liens that would not reasonably be

Effect. Except for normal wear and tear, to the knowledge of the Company, the

                     (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, easements,
variances, exceptions, certifications, registrations, consents, certificates,
approvals and other permits of any Governmental Entity ("Permits") necessary for
it to own, lease and operate the Company Assets or to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted (collectively, the "Company Permits"), and all such
Company Permits are in full force and effect, except as would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No suspension, revocation or cancellation of any of the Company Permits
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and no such
suspension or cancellation will result from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (b) The Company, and any of its Subsidiaries that directly

the Social Security Act (the "Medicare and Medicaid programs") are certified for
participation and reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The
Company, and any of its Subsidiaries that directly or indirectly receive
reimbursement or payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the CHAMPUS
and TRICARE programs and such other similar federal, state or local
reimbursement or governmental programs, (collectively, the "Government
Programs"), have current provider numbers and provider agreements required under
such Government Programs. The Company, and any of its Subsidiaries that directly
or indirectly receive payments under any non-governmental program, including any
private insurance program (collectively, the "Private Programs"), have all
provider agreements and provider numbers that are required under such Private
Programs.

                     (c) The Company has made available to Parent correct and

                     (d) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers, managers, employees or agents, is, and
during the past two years has not been, in conflict with, or in default or
violation of, (i) any Laws applicable to the Company or such Subsidiary or by
which any of the Company Assets is bound or (ii) any Company Permits, except as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No violation, default, Order or Legal Action
exists with respect to the aforementioned Company Permits, Medicare or Medicaid


                                       25

certifications, provider agreements or provider numbers (collectively, "Company
Regulatory Authorizations"), except as would not reasonably be expected,

unresolved (or, if resolved, without material Liability to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) written or oral notice of any violation or of any
investigation or inquiry into an alleged or suspected violation of any Law or of
any of the Company Regulatory Authorizations that would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the business, value or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the
knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no event has occurred that, with
the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute grounds for
a material violation or order with respect to any such Company Regulatory
Authorizations, or to revoke, withdraw or suspend any such Company Regulatory
Authorizations, or to terminate the participation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any Government Program or Private Program.

                     (e) To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2001,
none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer, professional
employee or contractor of the Company (during the term of such individual's
employment by the Company or while acting as an agent of the Company) or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates has been convicted of any crime, or knowingly engaged
in any conduct, for which debarment or similar punishment is mandated or
permitted by any applicable Law. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any officer, director or managing employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and no Person providing professional services in connection with
the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any
activities that are prohibited, or cause for the imposition of penalties or
mandatory or permissive exclusion, under 42 U.S.C. ss.ss. 1320a-7, 1230a-7a,
1320a-7b, 1395nn or 1396b, 31 U.S.C. ss.ss. 3729-3733, or the federal
CHAMPUS/TRICARE statute (or other federal or state statutes related to false or
fraudulent claims) or the regulations promulgated thereunder pursuant to such

Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports and billings required to be filed
prior to the date hereof with respect to the Government Programs and Private
Programs, all fiscal intermediaries and other insurance carriers and all such
reports and billings are complete and accurate in all material respects and have
been prepared in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws,
regulations, rules, manuals and guidance governing reimbursement and claims,
except where the failure to file in a timely manner would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the business,
value or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have paid or caused to be paid all known and
undisputed refunds, overpayments, discounts or adjustments that have become due
pursuant to such reports and billings, to the knowledge of the Company, have not
claimed or received reimbursements from Government Programs or Private Programs

                                       26
<PAGE>
Government Program or Private Program for any material refund, overpayment,
discount or adjustment. There are no pending appeals, adjustments, challenges,
audits, inquiries, litigation or written notices of intent to audit with respect
to such prior reports or billings, and during the last three years neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been audited, or otherwise examined by
any Government Program or Private Program.

                     (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is
a party to any consent, agreement or memorandum of understanding with any
Governmental Entity, (ii) is subject to any Order or (iii) has adopted any board
resolutions at the request of any Governmental Entity, in any case that
restricts the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to the
management or operation of its business (collectively, "Company Regulatory
Agreements"). To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has been advised by any Governmental Entity that such
Governmental Entity is considering issuing or requesting any Company Regulatory
Agreement.

                     (h) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, employee, agent or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made, directly or
indirectly, any (i) bribe or kickback, (ii) illegal political contribution,
(iii) payment from corporate funds which was improperly recorded on the books
and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) unlawful payment
from corporate funds to governmental officials for the purpose of influencing
their actions or the actions of the Governmental Entity which they represent or

                     Section 3.23 Insurance. All material policies of fire,
liability, workers' compensation, director and officer, malpractice and
professional liability and other forms of insurance providing insurance coverage
to or for any of the Company and its Subsidiaries including loss runs in respect
of each such policy for the last three years have been made available to Parent
and (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries are named insureds under such policies,
(ii) all premiums required to be paid with respect thereto covering all periods
up to and including the Effective Time have been paid, (iii) there has been no
material lapse in coverage under such policies during any period for which the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective operations, (iv)
each such policy has been issued on an "occurrence" basis and (v) no notice of
cancellation or termination has been received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any such policy. None of the Company or its
Subsidiaries has any obligation for retrospective premiums for any period prior
to the Effective Time which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such policies are in
full force and effect and will remain in full force and effect up to and
including the Effective Time, unless replaced with comparable insurance policies
having comparable terms and conditions. No insurer has put the Company on notice
that coverage has or may be denied with respect to any pending claim equal to or
in excess of $500,000 submitted to insurer by the Company.

                     Section 3.24 Rights Agreement. Except for the Company
Rights Agreement, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has in
effect any stockholder rights plan or similar device or arrangement, commonly or
colloquially known as a "poison pill" or "anti-takeover" plan or any similar
plan, device or arrangement and the board of directors of the Company has not
adopted or authorized the adoption of such a plan, device or arrangement. The
Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of the Company
Rights Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The Company has
taken all necessary action to:

                     (a) render the Company Rights inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

                     (b) ensure that (i) neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of
their Affiliates will become or be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" (as
defined in the Company Rights Agreement) and (ii) no "Distribution Date,"
"Shares Acquisition Date" or "Trigger Event" (each as defined in the Company
Rights Agreement) will occur by reason of (A) the approval, execution or
delivery of this Agreement, (B) the announcement or consummation of the Merger
or (C) the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

                     (c) cause the Company Rights to terminate immediately upon

business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no
other so-called "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
similar state anti-takeover laws ("Takeover Statutes") apply or purport to apply
to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements

made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of all agreements between
the Company and the Company Financial Advisor under which the Company Financial


                                       28

Subsidiaries and instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease any existing
solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity with any Person then

identity of such Person, a detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request and, if applicable, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall keep Parent fully informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.

                     (e) Subject to the Company's compliance with the provisions
of this Section 5.3 and prior to the obtaining of the Requisite Company Vote,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its board of directors
from:

                     (i) engaging in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnishing or disclosing any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, in response to a request therefor, giving access to the Company
Assets or the books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
any Person who has made a bona fide written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal

independent members of the board of directors, (B) determined, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that
such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal

failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws
and (y) the Company (A) enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person

the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) concurrently discloses or makes available
the same information to Parent as it makes available to such Person; and

                     (ii) subject to compliance with Section 5.3(e)(i), entering
into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior
Proposal, but only so long as (A) the board of directors, acting in good faith
and by a majority of the independent members of the board of directors, has
approved such definitive agreement, (B) the board of directors has determined,


                                       38
<PAGE>
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
that such bona fide written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (C) the board of directors of the Company has determined,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws and (D) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and after complying with all of the
provisions of, Section 7.4(a).

                     (f) The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean an Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the voting power of the Company's then
outstanding securities or all or substantially all of the Company Assets, taken
as a whole, which (i) is on terms and conditions more favorable from a financial
point of view to the unaffiliated stockholders of the Company than those
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the conditions to the consummation of which
are all reasonably capable of being satisfied in a timely manner, (iii) for
which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or reasonably likely
to be available and (iv) which was not made in violation of any standstill or
similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

                     (g) The board of directors of the Company shall not (i)
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into any agreement in principle or
understanding or a Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal, unless the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and after complying with all of
the provisions of, Section 7.4(a).

                     (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the board of
directors of the Company shall be permitted to disclose to the stockholders of
the Company a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal required by Rule
14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (ii) the board of directors of the Company may withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Board Recommendation at any time if it determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws.

                     (a) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as

(vi) any event, change, occurrence, destruction, damage, loss, circumstance or

warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement untrue or inaccurate in a
material respect or causes or would reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to cause any breach of the obligations of the Company under this
Agreement.

                     (b) Parent shall notify the Company as promptly as
practicable of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any written notice from any

<PAGE>
Company Proxy Statement, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.5(a),
prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as

                     Section 5.7 Financing.

                     (a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment
Letters and to satisfy the conditions (to the extent such conditions are under
the reasonable control of Parent) to obtaining the Financing set forth therein,
(ii) enter into definitive financing agreements (the "Financing Agreements")
with respect to the Financing so that the Financing Agreements are in effect as
promptly as practicable following satisfaction of the conditions to this
Agreement set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 and (iii) consummate the Financing
as soon as practicable following satisfaction of the conditions to this
Agreement set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of the financing process.

                     (b) If the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements
expire or are terminated for any reason, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of such expiration or termination and the reasons therefor and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being understood, however,
that such commercially reasonable efforts would not require Parent to obtain
financing that is (A) with respect to the economic terms thereof, on terms less
favorable to Parent thereunder than those set forth in the Commitment Letters or
the Financing Agreements, as the case may be (e.g., Parent shall not be required
to increase the amount of either the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing (or


                                       41
<PAGE>
the interest rates applicable thereto)) or (B) with respect to the non-economic
terms thereof, on terms that are substantially similar to those set forth in the
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements, as the case may be.

                     Section 5.8 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance.

                     (a) All rights to indemnification now existing in favor of
any current or former director, officer and employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time.

                     (b) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify all
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services
as directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to
the Effective Time including, without limitation, in respect of the matters set
forth herein. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement
of expenses to the Indemnified Parties to the same extent such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof
by the Company pursuant to the Company Organizational Documents subject to
Parent's receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to
repay such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.

                     (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for
at least six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred before or at the Effective Time so long as the Surviving
Corporation is not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of
this Agreement (such 200% amount being the "Maximum Premium"). If the Surviving

attempt would delay or jeopardize Parent's ability to effect the Merger. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall (x) independently participate in any meeting, or,
to the extent practicable, engage in any substantive conversation, with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other party hereto prior notice of the meeting and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend

the other party upon receipt of any notice or other communication from the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request
for additional information from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and

correspondence relating to any Legal Action against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers by any stockholder
of the Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall not cooperate with any Person
that may seek to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
with Parent and Merger Sub in resisting any such effort to restrain, enjoin,
prohibit or otherwise oppose such transactions. The Company shall give Parent

                      Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing

                      shall indemnify and hold harmless each person (and the
                      heirs, executors or administrators of such person) who was
                      or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or
                      is involved in any threatened, pending or completed
                      action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
                      administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact
                      that such person is or was a director or officer of the
                      Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
                      Corporation as a director or officer of another

<PAGE>
                      corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
                      enterprise (a "Covered Person"), to the fullest extent
                      permitted by General Corporation Law. The right to
                      indemnification conferred in this Section 7 shall be a
                      contract right.

                                 7.2 Other Indemnification. Nothing in this
                      Section 7 shall limit the right of the Corporation to
                      provide, by action of its Board, indemnification to such
                      of the officers, employees and agents of the Corporation
                      to such extent and to such effect as the Board shall
                      determine to be appropriate and authorized by the General
                      Corporation Law.

                                 7.3 Prepayment of Expenses. The right of any
                      person to indemnification conferred in this Section 7
                      shall also include the right to be paid by the Corporation
                      the expenses incurred in connection with any threatened,
                      pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
                      civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in
                      advance of its final disposition to the fullest extent
                      authorized by the General Corporation Law, subject to
                      receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on
                      behalf of such director or officer (or other person
                      indemnified hereunder), to repay any such amount so
                      advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
                      judicial decision from which there is no further right of
                      appeal that such director, officer or other person is not
                      entitled to be indemnified for such expenses.

                                 7.4 Other Sources. The Corporation's
                      obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to
                      any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as


<PAGE>
                      a director, officer, employee or agent of an Other Entity
                      shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may
                      collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from
                      such Other Entity.

                                 7.5 Insurance. The Corporation shall have the
                      power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
                      person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
                      agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
                      request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
                      employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
                      joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
                      expense, liability or loss incurred by such person in any
                      such capacity or arising out of his status as such,
                      whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
                      indemnify him against such liability under the General
                      Corporation Law.

                                 7.6 Nonexclusivity of Rights. The rights to
                      authority conferred in this Section 7 shall not be
                      exclusive of any other right that any Covered Person may
                      otherwise have or hereafter acquire.

                                 7.7 Amendment or Repeal of Certificate of
                      Incorporation or By-laws. Neither the amendment nor repeal
                      of this Section 7, nor the adoption of any provision of
                      this Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws, nor, to
                      the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation
                      Law, any modification of law, shall eliminate or reduce
                      the effect of this Section 7 in respect of any act or
                      omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal,
                      adoption or modification.
