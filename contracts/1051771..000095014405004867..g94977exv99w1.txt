Seller or the Companies (the "Excluded Liabilities"):   (i) any liability
or obligation for money borrowed (it being  understood that the liabilities
and obligations under any capital lease  set forth in Schedule 5.13 is an
Assumed Liability);   (ii) any liability or obligation with respect to Taxes
for which  Seller is liable under Section 8.2;   (iii) any liability or
obligation for costs and expenses (other than  Transfer Taxes and as set
forth in Section 8.6 or as otherwise expressly  set forth in this Agreement)
in connection with the negotiation and  execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby;   (iv) any liability
or obligation of Seller under this Agreement or  under any other agreement
between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the  one hand, and Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, entered  into on or after the date of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms  hereof;   (v) any liability or
obligation relating to any Business Plan,  Employment Agreement or other
employee benefit policies and practices of  Seller listed in Schedule
5.15(e), in each case, to the extent such  liabilities and obligations are
not expressly assumed by Buyer pursuant to  Section 8.3;   (vi) all payment
obligations relating to bonuses of employees of the  Business that have been
earned but have not been paid as of the Effective  Time;   18    (vii)
all intercompany accounts among Sellers and its Affiliates  relating to the
Business, which accounts are subject to Section 7.6;   (viii) any liability
or obligation to the extent related to the  Excluded Assets (except as
provided in Section 2.2 or 2.4) or any other  assets not transferred to and
not purchased by Buyer relating to the  Business (other than such liabilities
and obligations assumed by Buyer  pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(iii)), provided
that this clause shall not  affect any obligation of Buyer under the
Transition Services Agreement,  Club Libby Lu Licensed Departments Agreement
or Private Brands Agreement;   (ix) any liability or obligation relating to,
resulting from or  arising out of any former operations or properties of
Seller or any of the  Companies that have been discontinued or disposed of
prior to the Cut-Off  Date;   (x) any liability or obligation with respect
to any claim arising  out of an occurrence on or prior to the Cut-Off Date
for which Seller or  any of the Companies is insured under the commercial
general liability  policy covering the Business or the Assets (without regard
to any  deductible or self-insured amount), as in effect as of the date of
this  Agreement (whether or not Seller actually recovers any insurance
proceeds  with respect to such claim);   (xi) any liability or obligation
relating to the matters set forth  on Schedule 2.3(b)(xi) (subject to any
limitations set forth in such  schedule), including Seller\'s costs
associated with defending and managing  such matters (including attorneys\'
fees and costs of investigation); and   (xii) all unpaid accounts payable of
Seller or any of the Companies,  subject to Section 2.5.   Seller shall, or
shall cause the Companies to, pay, perform and fully observe all Excluded
Liabilities.   Section 2.4 Leased Department Agreements and Equipment
Lease Agreements. (a) Exhibit R sets forth each leased department agreement
relating both to the Business and to other businesses of Seller and its
Affiliates. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into new leased department agreements with the parties identified in Exhibit
R that relate exclusively to each party\'s own stores. If such new leased
department agreements are not in effect as of the Effective Time, the parties
agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by Requirements of Law or any
applicable leased department agreement, each party shall be solely
responsible for all obligations and liabilities, and shall receive all
claims, benefits and rights, under each such leased department agreement to
the extent related to stores operated by such party. Each party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the foregoing.   (b) Exhibit S
sets forth equipment lease agreements relating both to the Business and to
other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates. The parties agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals, consents
and waivers to   19   assign to Buyer that portion of the equipment lease
agreements (and any applicable schedules thereto) that relate exclusively to
the stores included in the Assets; provided, however, that Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be required to make any payments or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any
approval, consent or waiver except to the extent Buyer agrees to reimburse
Seller for any such payment made by Seller at the request of Buyer. If, prior
to the Closing, all necessary approvals, consents and waivers are not
obtained with respect to any equipment lease agreement, then (to the maximum
extent permitted by Requirements of Law or any applicable equipment lease
agreement) to the extent related to the stores included in the Assets, Buyer
shall assume the obligations and liabilities of Seller and the Companies
under such equipment lease agreement after the Cut-Off Date (but not such
equipment lease agreement itself), and Buyer shall receive the claims, rights
and benefits of Seller or any of the Companies arising under such equipment
lease agreement or resulting therefrom after the Cut-Off Date (but not such
equipment lease agreement itself).   Section 2.5 Accounts Payable. Promptly
following the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Cut-Off
Date AP Schedule") that sets forth Seller\'s good faith estimate of the
allocated accounts payable of the Business as of the close of business on the
Cut-Off Date, calculated using the same methods used to prepare such line
items in the Reference Working Capital Statement. Buyer shall pay Seller the
amounts set forth in the Cut-Off Date AP Schedule in accordance with Exhibit
2.5. The Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and Final Working Capital
shall include and reflect the allocated accounts payable of the Business set
forth in the Cut-Off Date AP Schedule.   ARTICLE III  PURCHASE
PRICE  Section 3.1 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Assets shall
be equal to $622,000,000 (six hundred twenty-two million dollars) (the
"Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.2. The
Purchase Price shall be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 4.2. To compensate
Seller for the Closing occurring after the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall pay
Seller at Closing an additional amount (the "Closing Date Interest") equal to
interest on the Purchase Price, calculated on the basis of the number of days
(excluding the Closing Date) by which the Closing follows the Cut-Off Date at
an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate in effect as of the
Closing Date.   Section 3.2 Adjustment of Purchase Price.   (a) Within 45
days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
statement (the "Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement") setting forth
Working Capital as of the close of business on the Cut-Off Date (the
determination of Working Capital, as it may be adjusted under this
Section 3.2 in the event of a Notice of Disagreement, is referred to as
"Final Working Capital"). Buyer shall reasonably assist Seller and its
representatives in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital
Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives reasonable access
at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of
Buyer and its Affiliates for such purpose.   20    (b) The Cut-Off Date
Working Capital Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on
the 30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives written
notice of its disagreement ("Notice of Disagreement") to Seller before such
date. A Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) may be
submitted only if, assuming all of Buyer\'s assertions therein
were sustained, an adjustment to the Purchase Price would be required under
Section 3.2(f), and the Notice of Disagreement must set forth Buyer\'s
determination of Final Working Capital and specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement with Seller\'s determination. The only
disagreements that may be set forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to
this Section 3.2(b) are those that relate to (x) any claimed inconsistencies
between the principles used in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Working
Capital Statement and the principles used in the preparation of the Reference
Working Capital Statement, (y) disputes regarding the results of the
inventory tabulation performed, or the Inventory Schedule prepared, pursuant
to Section 3.2(h) or (z) errors in mathematical computation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2, no disagreement set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement may relate to the principles used in the
preparation of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement, so long as those
principles are consistently applied with the Reference Working Capital
Statement. If a valid Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in a
timely manner, then the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and the Final
Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with clause (i) or (ii)
below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i)
the date the parties resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by
the Arbitrator.   (c) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to any matter
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day
period, Seller and Buyer have not reached agreement on all such matters, then
the matters that remain in dispute shall be promptly submitted to an
arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") for review and resolution. The Arbitrator shall
be a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be
agreed upon by the parties in writing, provided that the Arbitrator will not
be an accounting firm used by either Seller or Buyer for audit or valuation
purposes. The procedures for the arbitration shall be determined by the
Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in
dispute within 30 days following completion of the submissions to the
Arbitrator. Any item not specifically referred to in the Notice of
Disagreement shall be deemed final and binding on Buyer and Seller in the
manner set forth in the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement.
The Arbitrator shall determine Final Working Capital based solely on
presentations made by Seller and Buyer (and not by independent review).  
(d) The Non-Prevailing Party in any arbitration before the Arbitrator shall
pay its own expenses incurred with respect to the arbitration and shall pay a
percentage of (i) the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator plus (ii) the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) of
the other party incurred with respect to the arbitration, which percentage
shall be calculated by dividing (A) an amount equal to the difference between
the Non-Prevailing Party\'s determination of Final Working Capital,
as submitted to the Arbitrator, and the Arbitrator\'s determination of Final
Working Capital by (B) an amount equal to the difference between the
parties\' respective determinations of Final Working Capital, as submitted to
the Arbitrator. The other party shall pay the remainder of the fees and
expenses of the Arbitrator and its own expenses not required to be paid by
the Non-Prevailing Party hereunder. A party is the "Non-Prevailing Party" if
the Arbitrator\'s determination of Final Working Capital is closer to the
other party\'s determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted  
21   to the Arbitrator, than it is to that party\'s determination of Final
Working Capital, as submitted to the Arbitrator. In resolving any matter
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the Arbitrator shall not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party.   (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Reference Working
Capital" means $125,274,416, and "Adjustment Amount" means $8,800,000.  
(f) If Final Working Capital exceeds the Reference Working Capital, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the sum of (i) the amount by which Final
Working Capital exceeds the Reference Working Capital and (ii) the Adjustment
Amount. If the Reference Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital by
less than the Adjustment Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
difference between (A) the Adjustment Amount and (B) the amount by which the
Reference Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital. If the Reference
Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital by more than the Adjustment
Amount, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the difference between (x) the
amount by which the Reference Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital
and (y) the Adjustment Amount. The Purchase Price, as increased or decreased
by the adjustment provided for in this Section 3.2(f), is referred to as the
"Adjusted Purchase Price." If the Purchase Price is less than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Purchase Price is more than
the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five business days after
the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement becomes final and binding on the
parties, make payment to the other party of the amount of such difference,
together with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the three-month
LIBOR rate in effect as of the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of the
number of days elapsed from the Cut-Off Date through but excluding the
payment date.   (g) The term "Working Capital" means (i) the sum of
Inventory (as determined pursuant to Section 3.2(h)) (less any markdown
reserve) and prepaid assets of the Business, less (ii) allocated accounts
payable set forth in the Cut-Off Date AP Schedule and actual accrued expenses
of the Business, calculated on the same basis as reflected in the relevant
line items on the Reference Working Capital Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the computation of Working Capital will be done
in a manner consistent with methods used in the preparation of the Reference
Working Capital Statement, and the governing principle will be that the
adjustment contemplated by this Section 3.2 can be appropriately measured
only when the Reference Working Capital and the Final Working Capital are
computed on the same basis, using the same principles and methodologies.
Working Capital shall not include any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities
(including any liability or obligation with respect to Taxes).   (h) As
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Seller will engage
Regis or such other third party service provider that shall be mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and Seller (the "Inventory Firm") to perform a scanned
physical inventory between June 23 and June 29, 2005, or on such other dates
as may be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, to   22   determine
the quantity of Inventory located on the Real Estate. Such inventory shall be
taken in accordance with Seller\'s typical inventory procedures. The cost of
taking the inventory shall be shared equally between Buyer and Seller, and
such cost shall include only the fees and expenses incurred by the
Inventory Firm in connection with the taking of the inventory and the cost of
supplies utilized in the inventory. At its sole expense, each party may have
a reasonable number of representatives present to observe the taking of such
inventory and may verify the inventory tabulation as conducted. Immediately
upon completion of the inventory tabulation, Seller shall furnish Buyer with
a copy of the physical inventory data. Promptly following the completion of
the inventory tabulation, Seller shall prepare a schedule (the "Inventory
Schedule") that contains a roll forward of the physical inventory data to the
Cut-Off Date, using Seller\'s standard procedures for rolling forward
physical inventory data, and promptly following the completion of the
Inventory Schedule, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of the Inventory
Schedule. In the event that there is any dispute regarding the Inventory
Schedule prepared pursuant to this Section 3.2(h), such dispute shall be
resolved in connection with the determination of Final Working Capital, as
set forth in Sections 3.2(b) - 3.2(d).   Section 3.3 Allocation of Purchase
Price; Transfer Tax Valuation. (a) Within 60 days following the Closing Date,
Seller and Buyer shall negotiate and draft a schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price (increased to take into account the
Assumed Liabilities) among the Assets. The Allocation Schedule shall be
reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the regulations thereunder. Seller and Buyer each agrees that promptly
upon receiving such Allocation Schedule it shall return an executed copy
thereof to the other party. Seller and Buyer each agrees to file Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594, and all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns, in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. Seller and Buyer
each agrees to provide the other promptly with any other information required
to complete Form 8594.   (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer
shall jointly agree on the valuation of the Real Estate, Real Estate
Agreements and other Assets to the extent that valuations are needed for
purposes of determining the amount of Transfer Taxes. If a party disagrees
with respect to a proposed valuation, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the issue. If they cannot resolve the issue prior to the
Closing Date, it shall be resolved by an accounting or appraisal firm chosen
by and mutually acceptable to both parties after Closing. If payment of a
Transfer Tax is due prior to any such resolution, payment shall be made in
accordance with Section 8.2(a)(iv) based on Buyer\'s reasonable valuation
and, upon resolution, the party responsible for filing the Tax Return with
respect to such Tax shall make such corrective filings with the appropriate
Governmental Body and Buyer and Seller each shall pay 50% of any additional,
and each shall be entitled to 50% of any refund of any, Transfer
Tax resulting from such corrective filings.   Section 3.4 Certain Assets.
(a) Prior to the Closing, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the necessary landlord consent to assign to Buyer the Lease
Agreement listed in Exhibit T; provided, however, that (i) Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be required to make any payments or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain such
landlord consent except to the extent Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for
any such payment made by Seller or any of its Affiliates at the request of
Buyer, (ii) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
make any proposal or request to assign   23   such Lease Agreement and
(iii) no proposal or request to assign such Lease Agreement shall be made
without the prior written consent of Seller. If, prior to the Closing, the
necessary landlord consent with respect to such Lease Agreement has not been
obtained, then (x) all assets of Seller or any of the Companies solely
related to the store leased by Seller or any of the Companies pursuant to
such Lease Agreement shall constitute Excluded Assets, (y) all assets and
liabilities solely related to such store shall be excluded from
the calculations of Reference Working Capital and Final Working Capital and
(z) the Adjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced in the amount set forth on
Exhibit T.   (b) In the event that the necessary landlord consent with
respect to the Lease Agreement listed on Exhibit T has not been obtained
prior to the Closing but Seller obtains such landlord consent within 90 days
following the Closing Date, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing. As promptly
as practicable following the delivery of such notice, Buyer shall pay to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the
agreed value of the store with respect to which such notice relates, and
Seller will, or will cause the Companies to, convey to Buyer such store and
all assets of Seller or any of the Companies solely related to such
store.   Section 3.5 Certain Rights of First Refusal. If Buyer shall not
have secured to its satisfaction the unconditional release and waiver of the
rights of first refusal on the sale of the stores listed in Exhibit U from
the respective holders of such rights on or before Closing, then, at
Buyer\'s request, Seller, the Companies and Buyer shall promptly cooperate to
comply with the applicable provisions of the applicable right of first
refusal (including entering into separate purchase and sale agreements for
the Real Estate for each such store that is the subject of such right of
first refusal and excluding such Real Estate (but only to the extent the same
is subject to the right of first refusal in question and without effect on
the other Assets) from the terms of this Agreement), including providing the
holder of such right or option with such other sufficient information and
documentation to exercise such right. The separate purchase price for the
stores listed in Exhibit U for such purposes shall be as set forth in Exhibit
U. The Purchase Price under this Agreement shall not be reduced by such
amounts and shall be payable in full as otherwise provided in this Agreement
whether or not any such holder exercises any such right or the closing on or
conveyance of any of such stores occurs. However, if the Closing under this
Agreement occurs, Buyer shall be entitled to receive all proceeds payable
under each such separate agreement, whether the closing thereunder occurs
prior to, concurrent with or subsequent to the Closing under this Agreement,
whether payable by the holder of such right or by Buyer if such holder does
not exercise such right, provided that the proceeds shall not be payable
prior to Closing. If any such right is not exercised, then the store that was
the subject of such right shall be conveyed to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement or the applicable separate agreement, as the case may be.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER   As an inducement to Buyer to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows (it being  
26   understood that, except with respect to Section 5.23, Seller makes
no representation or warranty with respect to any Excluded Assets):  
Section 5.1 Organization of Seller; Power and Authority of Seller; Ownership
of the Companies. Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. All of the
issued and outstanding equity interests of each Company are held of
record and beneficially owned directly or indirectly by Seller. Seller is
duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease
or the nature of its activities, in each case in respect of the Business,
makes such qualifications necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its assets with
respect to the Business and to carry on the Business in the manner that it
was conducted immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.   Section
5.2 Organization of the Companies; Power and Authority of the Companies. Each
of the Companies is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or formation. Each of the Companies is duly qualified to
transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its
activities, in each case in respect of the Business, makes
such qualifications necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companies has the
corporate or other organizational power and authority to own or lease and
operate its assets and to carry on the Business in the manner that it was
conducted immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.   Section 5.3
Authority of Seller; Conflicts. (a) Seller has all requisite corporate power
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller (no
stockholder approval being required), and each of the Seller Ancillary
Agreements has been duly authorized by Seller. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and the
validity and binding effect of this Agreement on Buyer) constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance
with its terms, and each of the Seller Ancillary Agreements, upon execution
and delivery by Seller will be (assuming the valid authorization, execution
and delivery by Buyer, where Buyer is a party, and any other party or parties
thereto) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject, in the case of this Agreement and each of
the Seller Ancillary Agreements, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general application relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights and to general equity principles.   (b) Subject to
Section 5.8(d) and except as set forth in Schedule 5.3, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the Seller Ancillary Agreements by
Seller, the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby by Seller or   27   compliance with or fulfillment of the terms,
conditions and provisions hereof or thereof by Seller will not:   (i)
assuming the receipt of all necessary consents and approvals and  the filing
of all necessary documents as described in Section 5.3(b)(ii),  result in a
breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or  constitute a default,
an event of default or an event creating rights of  acceleration, termination
or cancellation or a loss of rights under, or  result in the creation or
imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the  Assets, under (1) the charter,
bylaws or similar organizational documents  of Seller or the Companies, (2)
any Business Agreement, (3) any Court  Order to which Seller or the Companies
is a party or by which Seller or  any of the Companies is bound or (4) any
Requirements of Law affecting  Seller or the Companies, other than, in the
case of clauses (2), (3) and  (4) above, any such breaches, defaults, rights,
loss of rights or  Encumbrances that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or would
not prevent the  consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
or   (ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the 
making by Seller or the Companies of any declaration, filing or  registration
with, any Governmental Body, except (1) in connection, or in  compliance,
with the provisions of the HSR Act, (2) the filing with the  SEC of such
reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in  connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,  (3) applicable
requirements, if any, of the New York Stock Exchange, (4)  such consents,

Law with respect to environmental matters pertaining to  any notification,

by this Agreement, (5) such filings as may be  required in connection with
the Taxes described in Section 8.2(a)(iv), and  (6) such approvals, consents,
authorizations, declarations, filings or  registrations the failure of which
to be obtained or made would not,  individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect or would not
prevent the consummation of any of  the transactions contemplated hereby.  
No representation or warranty is made as to whether any new governmental
approvals, consents, licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, declarations,
filings or registrations will be required as a result of the sale of the

any other businesses of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the

other party under this Section 7.2, (x) such non-breaching party shall only
be entitled to seek indemnification for breach of this Section 7.2 if and to
the extent such non-breaching party is otherwise entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) for breach of a representation and warranty
and the limits set forth in Section 11.1(a) shall apply to any such
indemnification and (y) a failure to comply with this Section 7.2 shall not
cause the failure of any condition set forth in Articles IX or X to be
satisfied unless the underlying change, event or development would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Articles IX
or X to be satisfied. Each party acknowledges that the other party does not
and will not waive any rights it may have under this Agreement as a result of
receiving such notifications.   Section 7.3 Consents of Third Parties;

Affiliates to, renew, extend, amend or supplement any loan, contract,
lease or other obligation that is covered by an Other Guaranty or an
Identified Guaranty without providing Seller with evidence reasonably

shall be delivered to Seller.   Section 7.8 Ancillary Agreements. (a) At

form reasonably satisfactory to Seller) or (b) (i) purchase the "Accounts"
and "Account Receivables" (as each such term is defined in the Program
Agreement) associated with such stores from Household Bank for the price set
forth in Section 9.05(b) of the Program Agreement and (ii) pay over to Seller
on the effective date of such purchase cash in the amount equal to the
difference between (x) the amount paid to Household Bank in connection with
such purchase and (y) the amount equal to the price set forth in Sections
9.06(b)(i) and (ii) of the Program Agreement multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the sum of the Account Receivables
associated with the stores included in the Assets (as of the date of
purchase) and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the Account
Receivables associated with all stores (including the stores included in the
Assets) covered by the Program Agreement (as of the date of purchase). Buyer
agrees to obtain all necessary consents and approvals from all Governmental
Bodies and to make all necessary registrations and filings in order to effect
this Section 7.9. At Buyer\'s request, Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in complying with this Section
7.9; provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required
to make any   46    payments or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party with respect to this Section 7.9,
except to the extent that Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller or any such
Affiliate for any such payment made by Seller or such Affiliate at the
request of Buyer.   Section 7.10 Remittance of Cash Receipts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all receipts by
Seller or any of the Companies on or before the Cut-Off Date, including cash
(excluding Register and Store Safe Cash), checks and bank drafts (whether
cleared before or after the Effective Time), and proceeds from third-party
credit card or debit card transactions (whether posted before or after the
Effective Time) shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby,
and Buyer shall cause payment in an aggregate amount equal to such receipts
to be made to Seller immediately after Seller makes demand therefor;
provided, however, that (i) this Section 7.10 shall not affect accounts and
account receivables owned by Household Bank and (ii) Seller shall cause the
Companies to be in possession of the Register and Store Safe Cash at the
opening of the stores of the Business on the day after the Cut-Off Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, Reference Working Capital and Final Working Capital
shall be determined without giving effect to any such cash, checks, bank
drafts or proceeds.   Section 7.11 Software Issues. Prior to the Closing,

licensor or a sublicense under the Transition Services Agreement sufficient
to allow Buyer to use such Software during the term set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement and, with respect to the Software identified in
Schedule 7.11, to allow Seller and its Affiliates to sell, transfer, convey
and deliver to Buyer all Equipment upon which such Software is loaded without
obligating Seller or its Affiliates to remove such Software from such
Equipment prior to the sale, transfer, conveyance and delivery thereof;
provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to
pay money or grant any accommodation to any third party in order to obtain
any such consents and acknowledgements, except to the extent that Buyer
agrees to reimburse Seller or such Affiliate for any such payment made by
Seller or such Affiliate at the request of Buyer. With respect to any item
identified in Schedule 7.11 for which the applicable third-party
licensor would not provide such consents and acknowledgements prior to the
Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall have the right to remove such
identified Software from Equipment prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that, subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence, Seller and
its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the benefits
of such Software license agreements available to Buyer.   Section 7.12 No
Solicitation. After the date hereof and prior to the earlier of the Closing

facilitate the making of any Asset Acquisition Proposal or (b) participate
in, engage in, knowingly encourage or facilitate any discussion
or negotiation regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with
respect to, or knowingly take any other action to assist or facilitate any
inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Asset Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller or
its Board of   47    Directors from (i) soliciting or initiating the
submission of any Seller Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer
relating exclusively to assets and properties not being sold pursuant to this
Agreement or (ii) complying with Section 3.5.   Section 7.13 Interim

efforts to enter into such agreements with third-party vendors as are
necessary to enable Seller to deliver Products (as defined in the Private
Brands Agreement) to Buyer; provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates
shall have no obligation to pay money or grant any accommodation to any third
party in order to enter into such agreements, except to the extent that Buyer
agrees to reimburse Seller or such Affiliate for any such payment made by
Seller or such Affiliate at the request of Buyer.   (b) Buyer acknowledges
that Schedule 1 of the Private Brands Agreement was prepared prior to the
date hereof based on information then available to Seller. On or before May

Brands Agreement will be finalized by Seller as of five days before the
Closing to reflect new orders and fill-in orders placed (in each case,
subject to Section 7.04(b)(xvii)), goods received, new information obtained
and other adjustments made in the ordinary course of business between the
date Schedule 1 was originally prepared and the date Schedule 1 is
finalized (regardless of the expected delivery date). At the Closing, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer such finalized Schedule 1.   (c) If the Closing
occurs on or prior to July 5, 2005, Buyer shall not be obligated to take

finalized version of Schedule 1 of the Private Brands Agreement regardless of
the expected delivery date or the date on which such schedule may have been
previously finalized.   Section 7.15 Certain Agreement. Prior to Closing
and for a reasonable period thereafter, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to
assist Buyer in entering into an agreement with Axiom International with

ARTICLE VIII  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Section 8.1 Use of Names. (a) Seller
is not conveying ownership rights or granting Buyer a license to use any of
the tradenames, service marks or trademarks of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller (other than the trademarks and service marks included in the Company
Registered Intellectual Property identified in Schedule 5.10(a))
(collectively, the "Retained Names and Marks") and, after the Closing, Buyer
shall not use in any manner the names or marks of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller or any word that is similar in sound or appearance to such names or

Affiliate of Buyer violates any of its obligations under this Section 8.1,
Seller and its Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in equity for such
damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges
that a violation of this Section 8.1 may cause Seller and its Affiliates
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by
money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this Section 8.1, Seller and each of its Affiliates
shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to a
temporary restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief
against Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this

using any (i) advertising or promotional materials and (ii) any stationery,
business cards, business forms and other similar items included in the
Assets, in each case that contain anywhere thereon any of the Retained Names
and Marks; provided, however, that Buyer shall, when using items referred to
in clause (ii) in the context of entering into or conducting contractual
relationships, make reasonably clear to all other applicable parties that
Buyer, rather than Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, is the party
entering into or conducting the contractual relationship; and provided,
further, that Buyer shall ensure that personnel of the Business using such
items shall not, and shall have no authority to, hold themselves out as
officers, employees or agents of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.   (c)
Buyer shall cease promptly, but in no event later than 120 days after the
Cut-Off Date, using any packaging materials included in the Assets that
contain anywhere thereon any of the Retained Names and Marks, unless
such materials are changed to completely and permanently cover, delete or
obliterate the Retained Names and Marks or anything confusingly similar
thereto.   (d) Buyer shall have the right to exhaust all inventories
of finished products included in the Assets that contain as part of the
physical products themselves (e.g., embroidered on a shirt or a label on a
shirt, but not product packaging covered by clause (c) above) any of the
Retained Names and Marks, provided that Buyer shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to dispose of such finished products promptly after the
Cut-Off Date.   (e) At the Closing, Seller shall present (or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to present) Buyer with a short-term trademark and trade
name license agreement that grants Buyer the short-term right, subject to the
restrictions set forth in clauses (b) through (d) above, to use the Retained
Names and Marks for the time periods set forth in clauses (b) through (d)
above.   49     (f) Other than as permitted under clauses (b) through
(d) above, Buyer shall not use, without the prior written consent of Seller,
any of the Retained Names and Marks (or anything confusingly similar thereto)
in any manner whatsoever.   (g) At the Closing, Buyer will enter into a
short-term trademark and trade name license agreement that grants Seller and
Affiliates of Seller the right to use the trademarks, tradenames and service
marks identified in Schedule 5.10(a) in a manner similar to the manner in
which Seller and Affiliates of Seller use such trademarks, tradenames and
service marks as of the date of this Agreement for a period of up to 180 days
following the Cut-Off Date.   Section 8.2 Tax Matters. (a) Liability for
Taxes. (i) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against, any and all Taxes
imposed on Seller or any of the Companies, or for which Seller or any of the
Companies may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends
on or before the Cut-Off Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Cut-Off Date.
Seller shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which it
is liable under this Agreement.   (ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay,
and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and
against, any and all Taxes imposed with respect to the Business, the Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities for any taxable year or period that begins after
the Cut-Off Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning immediately after the Cut-Off Date. Buyer
shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which it is
liable under this Agreement.   (iii) For purposes of Sections 8.2(a)(i) and
(ii), any Straddle Period shall be treated on a "closing of the books" basis
as two partial periods, one ending on the Cut-Off Date and the other
beginning immediately after the Cut-Off Date; provided, however, that Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated pro rata on a daily basis.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement result in the reassessment of the value of any of the Assets
for property Tax purposes, or the imposition of any property Taxes on such
Assets at a rate which is different than the rate that would have been
imposed if such transactions had not occurred, then (y) the portion of such
property Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Cut-Off
Date shall be (1) allocated pro rata on a daily basis, using the assessed
value and Tax rate that would have applied had such transactions not
occurred, plus (2) 50% of any Incremental Property Taxes, and (z) the portion
of such property Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
immediately after the Cut-Off Date shall be the total property Taxes for such
Straddle Period minus the amount described in clause (y).   (iv)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer agrees to pay, and
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and
against, 50 percent of any and all real property transfer or gains
Taxes, sales Taxes, use Taxes, stamp Taxes, stock transfer Taxes or other
similar Taxes imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and Seller agrees to pay, and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against 50
percent of any and all Transfer Taxes.   50     (b) Tax Returns. (i)
Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to the Business and the Assets for periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date and Seller shall
remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such
Tax Returns. Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Business and
the Assets, and Buyer shall remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. For administrative convenience, Buyer and Seller
agree that, for federal and applicable state income tax purposes, items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit with respect to the Business and the
Assets realized during the period between the Cut-Off Date and the Closing
will be reported by Buyer on its Tax Returns and not by Seller or any of the
Companies. Seller or Buyer shall pay the other party for the Taxes for which
Seller or Buyer, respectively, is liable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) but which
are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to
this Section 8.2(b) upon the written request of the party entitled to
payment, setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of the amount
owed by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than 10
business days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes.   (ii) None of
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall amend, refile or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Business or the Assets (or with
respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  
(c) Bulk Sales Laws. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Buyer, Seller and the
Companies, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, with the
provisions of any applicable bulk transfer laws.   (d) Assistance and
Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall (and
cause their respective Affiliates to):   (i) assist the other party in
preparing any Tax Returns which such  other party is responsible for
preparing and filing in accordance with  Section 8.2(b);   (ii) cooperate
fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes  with taxing authorities
regarding, any Tax Returns that are required to be  filed by or with respect
to the Business or the Assets;   (iii) make available to the other and to
any taxing authority as  reasonably requested all information, records and
documents relating to  Taxes imposed with respect to the Business, the Assets
or the Assumed  Liabilities;   (iv) provide timely notice to the other in
writing of any pending or  threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to
Taxes for which the other  may have a liability under this Section 8.2;  
51     (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received 
from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information 
request with respect to any such Tax;   (vi) timely sign and deliver such
certificates or forms as may be  necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise  reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports
with respect to, Taxes  described in Section 8.2(a)(iv) (relating to sales,
transfer and similar  Taxes); and   (vii) timely provide to the other party
powers of attorney or  similar authorizations necessary to carry out the
purposes of this Section  8.2.   Section 8.3 Employees and Employee
Benefits.   (a) Offers of Employment. The employment of all Business
Employees will be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Buyer will offer employment effective as of the Effective Time to all
Business Employees, including each such employee on medical, disability,
family or other leave of absence as of the Effective Time except those
Business Employees who at the Effective Time are receiving long-term
disability benefits under any Business Plan, which Business Employees will be
offered employment by Buyer provided that they report for active employment
within six months after the date on which they began receiving long-term
disability benefits. Buyer will condition its offers of employment to each of
the individuals listed in Schedule 8.3(a) on such individual\'s execution of
an agreement, in form reasonably satisfactory to Seller, releasing all claims
and waiving all rights under such individual\'s Employment Agreement with
Seller or any Company, and Buyer shall have no liability with respect to any
such Employment Agreement other than with respect to severance obligations up
to the amount described in the second sentence of Section 8.3(b). Within ten
business days prior to the Effective Time, Seller will provide to Buyer a
list showing the names of each then employee of the Business who is on leave
of absence (and such list shall be updated as of the Closing Date). The
offers of employment to be made by Buyer effective as of the Effective Time
shall in each case provide (i) at least the same base wages, annual base
salary and annual base rate of bonus potential at target performance levels
(determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (other than
employee benefits, which are subject to Section 8.3(c)) as the base wages,
annual base salary and annual base rate of bonus potential at target
performance levels (determined as a percentage of annual base salary) (but
excluding any equity-based compensation) provided to each such Business
Employee on the Cut-Off Date and (ii) with respect to any Business Employee
who is a participant in the Severance Pay Plan, employment at a location not
more than fifty miles from the Business Employee\'s current location. The
employees who accept such offers of employment are referred to as
"Transferred Employees." Nothing in this Section 8.3(a) shall obligate Buyer
to continue the employment of any such Transferred Employee for any specific
period or at any specific level of compensation or responsibilities.   (b)
Individual Employment Agreements. As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume
Seller\'s and each Company\'s obligations under all individual employment,
termination, retention, severance or other similar contracts or agreements
with any current or former employee of the Business listed in Schedule
8.3(b). Notwithstanding anything in this   52    agreement to the
contrary, with respect to any Business Employee who is a party to an
Employment Agreement with Seller or any Company (whether or not
such Employment Agreement has been listed on any schedule to this Agreement),
(i) Buyer shall be responsible for any severance benefits payable to such
Business Employee in accordance with Section 8.3(d) (without regard to such
Business Employee\'s Employment Agreement with Seller or any Company) and
(ii) Seller shall be responsible for any severance benefits payable to such
Business Employee under such Business Employee\'s Employment Agreement with
Seller or any Company that is in excess of the severance benefits payable by
Buyer pursuant to clause (i).   (c) Buyer\'s Employee Benefit Plans
Generally. As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available to each
Transferred Employee employee benefits (other than benefits under Buyer\'s
employee benefit plan which is a defined benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 414(j) of the Code) that are at least comparable to the benefits that
are made available to an employee of Buyer who performs comparable services
or undertakes comparable responsibilities for Buyer and who has completed the
same length of service with Buyer. After the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided in the following subsections of this Section 8.3, the
following shall apply:   (i) Buyer shall give each Transferred Employee
service credit under  Buyer\'s DC Plan or Welfare Plans (collectively,
"Buyer\'s Plans") or  personnel policies that cover the Transferred Employee,
including any  vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of
eligibility,  vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits for  the Transferred Employee\'s service with Seller and its
Affiliates prior to  the Effective Time on the same basis as Buyer credits
service for its own  employees and, with respect to Buyer\'s Welfare Plans,
shall allow such  Transferred Employees to participate in each such Welfare
Plan of Buyer  without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting
periods,  evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not
imposed on  the Transferred Employee by the corresponding Welfare Plans of
Seller in  which such Transferred Employee was a participant immediately
prior to the  Effective Time and shall credit the Transferred Employee with
any expenses  that were paid by the Transferred Employee under the Welfare
Plans of  Seller for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other 
applicable limits under Buyer\'s Plans. To the extent any Transferred 
Employee or eligible dependent of any Transferred Employee is hospitalized 
as of the Effective Time under any Business Plan providing medical  benefits,
such person will continue to be covered under the medical  coverage provided
by such Business Plan until the date such Transferred  Employee or such
eligible dependent is released from the hospital, and  Seller shall be
responsible for any expenses associated with such extended  hospital stay
payable under any Business Plan that are incurred after the  Effective
Time.   (ii) No portion of the assets of any trust or other fund
maintained  by Seller for the purpose of paying benefits under any of the
Business  Plans will be transferred to Buyer or any Buyer\'s Plan.   (d)
Severance Benefits. (i) If any Transferred Employee is involuntarily
terminated by Buyer in the fiscal year that includes the Cut-Off Date, Buyer
will provide to the Transferred Employee severance pay under a Buyer\'s Plan
in an amount that is at least equal to   53    the specified amount of
severance pay payable to such Transferred Employee under the severance plans
or practices listed in Schedule 5.15(f) (the "Business Severance
Practices").   (ii) Buyer and Seller agree that, with respect to any
Business Employee terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 8.3(a), if
Buyer\'s offer of employment satisfies the requirements of Section 8.3(a),
Buyer will not be obligated to pay any severance with respect to such
Business Employee as a result of such termination by Seller. Buyer and Seller
agree that, with respect to any Transferred Employee whose employment
terminates after Closing, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be treated as if they were a "change of control" under the Severance
Pay Plan. If any such Transferred Employee would have been entitled to
severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan as a result of termination
under such circumstances, Buyer will provide to such Transferred Employee the
severance pay and other benefits provided under the Severance Pay Plan in
lieu of any severance to which such Transferred Employee would be entitled
under any Buyer\'s Plan.   (e) Vacation Pay and Holidays. Buyer shall credit
to each Transferred Employee all unpaid vacation and holiday pay for calendar
year 2005 that the Transferred Employee is entitled to use for calendar year
2005 but has not used as of the Effective Time and shall assume all liability
for the payment of such amounts pursuant to the Seller vacation and holiday
pay policies listed in Schedule 5.15(e) to the extent such vacation and
holidays are taken in calendar year 2005; provided, however, that no credit
under this Section 8.3(e) shall duplicate credit under Section 8.3(c).  
(f) Post-Leave Employment. (i) Seller and the Business Plans shall retain the
liability for all long-term disability benefits payable to any Business
Employee who is receiving or is entitled to receive long-term disability
benefits under the terms of any Business Plan at the Effective Time and shall
continue to provide such benefits in accordance with the terms of such plan
until the Business Employee is no longer eligible for such benefits,
(ii) Buyer or a Buyer\'s Plan shall provide short-term disability benefits to
any Transferred Employee who is receiving or is eligible for such benefits
under a Business Plan at the Effective Time until the date such Transferred
Employee would no longer be eligible for such benefits under such Business
Plan or the date on which the Transferred Employee qualifies for long-term
disability benefits under a Business Plan, whichever comes first, and, if
such a Transferred Employee qualifies for long-term disability benefits under
a Business Plan, Buyer shall provide such long-term disability benefits to
such Transferred Employee under Buyer\'s Plans and (iii) Buyer\'s Plans will
govern the determination of what, if any, short-term and long-term disability
benefits will be paid to any Transferred Employee whose disability occurs
after the Effective Time (or which reoccurs after the Effective Time). If any
Transferred Employee is on any form of leave of absence on the Effective Time
(including any leave subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or
comparable state law), Buyer shall reinstate such Transferred Employee to
active employment upon the expiration of the leave to the extent such
reinstatement is required by any applicable law or regulation or by Buyer\'s
personnel policies and shall satisfy any other obligation with respect to
such Transferred Employee as required under any applicable law or regulation
or Buyer\'s personnel policies.   (g) Medical and Dental Plan Liabilities.
Seller shall, or shall cause the applicable Business Plan to, pay any
benefits or expenses covered by the group medical and   54    dental
plans included within the Business Plans that were incurred with respect to
services performed for any Business Employee or any dependent or
former dependent of any Business Employee prior to the Effective Time but
have not been paid by the Business Plans prior to the Effective Time. Except
as provided in Section 8.3(c)(i), Buyer shall, or cause the applicable
Buyer\'s Plan to, assume and pay any medical or dental benefits covered under
the applicable Buyer Plan that are incurred with respect to services
performed for any Transferred Employee or any Transferred Employee\'s
dependents after the Effective Time.   (h) COBRA Coverage. Effective as of
the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide (or cause a Buyer\'s Plan to provide)
all entitlements under Code Section 4980B, Part 6 or 7 of Title I of ERISA or
any similar state law (collectively, "COBRA") to Transferred Employees and
eligible dependents of Transferred Employees with respect to any event which
requires the provision of such entitlements and which occurs after the
Effective Time. Seller shall provide (or cause the applicable Business Plan
to provide) all entitlements under COBRA to Business Employees and eligible
dependents of Business Employees with respect to any event which requires the
provision of such entitlements and which occurs on or before the Effective
Time.   (i) Retirement and 401(k) Plans.   (i) Buyer will have no
liability for benefits payable under the Saks  Incorporated 401(k) Retirement
Plan ("Seller\'s DC Plan"). Seller shall  take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary to fully vest Transferred  Employees under Seller\'s DC
Plan and all other Business Plans that are  deferred compensation or
supplemental retirement plans.   (ii) Buyer currently maintains one or more
qualified defined  contribution plans ("Buyer\'s DC Plan") that contains all
provisions  necessary for the acceptance of direct rollovers (in the form of
cash and  notes relating to plan participant loans not in default) of
"eligible  rollover distributions" as defined in the Code and applicable
regulations  that Transferred Employees are eligible to receive from
Seller\'s DC Plan.  Buyer\'s DC Plan will contain provisions to permit any
such direct rollover  to include the promissory note or notes representing
any plan loans  outstanding and not in default to the Transferred Employee
under Seller\'s  DC Plan on the date of the direct rollover, and Buyer, the
Companies and  Seller will cooperate with each other to enable such direct
rollovers to  occur before such loans become defaulted. Seller agrees not to
place any  such loans in default for at least 90 days following the Cut-Off
Date.   (iii) If a Transferred Employee is making contributions to
Seller\'s  DC Plan which are eligible for matching contributions by Seller 
immediately before the Effective Time, such Transferred Employee shall be 
eligible for matching contributions under Buyer\'s DC Plan if such 
Transferred Employee elects to participate in Buyer\'s DC Plan and Buyer 
(based on the advice of legal counsel) reasonably determines that such 
Transferred Employee can be eligible for such matching contributions  without
jeopardizing the qualified status of Buyer\'s DC Plan under Section  401(a)
of the Code.   55     (j) Retained Business Plans. Seller will retain
any and all liabilities and obligations with respect to benefits payable to
or with respect to any individual under the Business Plans and other employee
benefit policies and practices of Seller except to the extent that such
liabilities and obligations are expressly assumed by Buyer under this Section
8.3.   (k) Workers\' Compensation Liabilities. Seller shall be
responsible for the cost and expense of all workers\' compensation claims
asserted and arising out of an injury sustained by Business Employees prior
to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be responsible for the cost and
expense of all workers\' compensation claims asserted and arising out of any
injury sustained by Transferred Employees on or after the Effective Time or
with respect to injuries which relate to an event or circumstance or events
or circumstances that straddles or straddle the Effective Time, if the date
of the original claim relating to such injury is after the Effective Time,
regardless of the date of injury.   (l) No Third Party Beneficiaries.
Without limiting the generality of Section 13.5(b), none of the preceding
subsections of this Section 8.3 shall confer any rights or remedies upon any
employee or former employee of Seller, the Companies or Buyer, or upon any
other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.   Section 8.4 Insurance; Risk of Loss. (a) Seller will, or will
cause the Companies to, (with respect to the Business and the Assets) keep
insurance policies currently maintained by Seller or the Companies covering
their respective businesses, assets, liabilities and current or former
employees, as the case may be, or suitable replacements therefor, in full
force and effect through the close of business on the Closing Date, and Buyer
shall become solely responsible for all insurance coverage and related risk
of loss based on events occurring after the Closing Date with respect to the
Business. All proceeds of insurance payable (in excess of any deductible,
retention or self-insurance amount) in respect of any event that occurs on or
before the Cut-Off Date, to the extent that the proceeds are for damaged
properties or assets that constitute Assets and would otherwise be payable to
Seller or its Affiliates, shall be received by Seller and (a) to the extent
the damage to the Assets to which the proceeds pertain has not been repaired
or restored or paid for by Seller, shall be paid over to Buyer at the
Closing, or, if no proceeds have been received before the Closing, Seller
shall assign any of its claims thereto to Buyer promptly following the
Closing Date, and (b) to the extent the damage to the Assets to which the
proceeds pertain has been repaired or restored or paid for by Seller, shall
be retained by Seller on or prior to the Closing, or, if no proceeds have
been received before the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to all claims
thereto. Provided that Seller complies with Seller\'s obligations under this
Section 8.4, neither the occurrence of any casualty damage nor the
payment, receipt or collection of insurance proceeds shall be included or
accounted for in any way under the provisions of Section 3.2 or in the
determination of Final Working Capital. To the extent that after the Closing
any party hereto requires any information regarding claim data, payroll or
other information in order to make filing with insurance carriers or self
insurance regulators from another party hereto, the other party will promptly
supply such information.   (b) After the Closing, at the request of Buyer,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure all proceeds of
insurance payable in respect of any claim that is an Assumed Liability and
that arises out of any occurrence on or prior to the Cut-Off Date for which
Seller or any of the Companies is insured under Seller\'s employee practices
policy or   56    automobile liability policy covering the Business or
the Assets. Any insurance recovery in respect of any such claim received by
Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be remitted to Buyer (after deducting
therefrom any deductible, retention or self-insurance amount that has not
previously been paid or reimbursed by Buyer and the full amount of any
expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in procuring such
recovery).   Section 8.5 Consents. Buyer acknowledges that (i) certain
consents (including consents contingent on the fulfillment of certain
conditions), approvals, waivers, agreements, or actions of, or (with or
without lapse of time) notice to, third parties relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required under instruments, contracts,
commitments, agreements or arrangements (including the Leasehold Interests
and Real Estate Agreements) (the "Required Consents"), which Required
Consents have not been obtained or are themselves subject to conditions not
fulfilled as of the Closing, and (ii) certain governmental franchises,
approvals, permits, licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances
and similar rights may be required in order for Buyer to conduct the Business
and own the Assets following the Cut-Off Date in the same manner in which the
Business was conducted and the Assets were owned prior to the Cut-Off Date.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 2.2 or this Section 8.5 and
subject to compliance with Sections 2.2 and 7.3 and this Section 8.5, Seller
and the Companies shall not have any liability whatsoever to Buyer arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Required Consents or any such
governmental franchises, approvals, permits, licenses, orders, registrations,
certificates, variances or similar rights that may be required. Subject to
Seller\'s compliance with Sections 2.2 and 7.3 and this Section 8.5, no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller or any Company contained
herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed
not satisfied, based on (A) the failure to obtain any such Required Consents
or any such governmental franchises, approvals, permits, licenses, orders,
registrations, certificates, variances or similar rights or (B) any lawsuit,
action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
such Required Consents or any such governmental franchises, approvals,
permits, licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances or similar
rights; provided, however, that nothing stated herein shall supersede the
conditions set forth in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 10.1 and 10.2 or the obligations
of Seller under Section 2.2 or 7.3 or this Section 8.5. At the request of
Buyer, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and
cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable manner in connection with Buyer
obtaining, any Required Consents and any governmental franchises, approvals,
permits, licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances or similar
rights; provided, however, that such action shall not include any requirement
of Seller or any of its Affiliates to commence or participate in
any litigation, make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation or
undertake any liability or obligation (in each case financial or otherwise)
to any third party (including any Governmental Body) unless in the case of
any cost or expense incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates, Buyer agrees
to reimburse Seller for such cost or expense arising from any action by
Seller or such Affiliate requested by Buyer.   Section 8.6 Fees and
Expenses. Except as provided in this Section 8.6 and in Section 8.10 or as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the fees and   57    disbursements of counsel,
financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expenses, provided that all expenses incurred in connection with
obtaining any updated title commitments shall be paid by Buyer.   Section
8.7 Gift Cards, Etc; Return Policies. Following the Cut-Off Date, without
recourse to Seller or any Company, Buyer shall manage and honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, all Seller Gift Programs with
respect to all loyalty program awards, frequent shopper awards, gift
certificates, gift cards, merchandise vouchers, coupons and refunds
purchased, issued or earned in connection with the Business on or before the
Cut-Off Date. For the 120-day period following the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall
honor all Seller Return Policies with respect to products sold in connection
with the Business on or before the Cut-Off Date, without recourse to Seller
or any Company.   Section 8.8 HIPAA Confidentiality. Buyer shall enter into
such confidentiality agreements with respect to all Books and Records
relating to the Transferred Employees as may be required under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("HIPAA"). Seller and the
Companies may withhold from Buyer any portions of such Books and Records that
contain protected health information on Transferred Employees or their
dependents to the extent Seller and the Companies reasonably determine based
on advice of counsel that disclosure of such information to Buyer would
violate HIPAA. Seller and the Companies will cooperate with Buyer to the
extent that, in connection with making offers of employment to Business
Employees, Buyer seeks any release of records from any Business Employee as
may be required under HIPAA. To the extent permitted by Requirements of Law,
Seller will provide information relating to Business Employees to the extent
Buyer reasonably requests such information and such information is necessary
for Buyer to make offers of employment to Business Employees.   Section 8.9
Non-Solicitation of Employees. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
(a) for a period of one year from the date of this Agreement, solicit the
services, as employee, consultant or otherwise, (or cause or seek to cause to
leave the employ of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries) any Transferred
Employee or (b) for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement,
solicit the services, as employee, consultant or otherwise, (or cause or seek
to cause to leave the employ of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries)
any Transferred Employee at or above the level of store manager in the
Business; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with
respect to any Transferred Employee as to whom conversations were initiated
by such Transferred Employee after such Transferred Employee was discharged
from or resigned employment with Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or (ii)
with respect to any public advertisement or general solicitation (or any
hiring pursuant thereto) that is not specifically targeted at Transferred
Employees. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to cooperate with the other party
to correct any inadvertent breach of this Section 8.9 by Seller or any of its
Affiliates.   Section 8.10 SEC Financials. (a) Seller shall deliver to
Buyer within 60 days following the Closing Date, (i) the audited balance
sheet of the Business as of January 29, 2005 and the related statements of
income, shareholders\' equity and cash flows of the Business for the fiscal
year ended January 29, 2005, in a form that, at the time of delivery, Seller
reasonably believes to have been prepared in accordance with GAAP as required
by Regulation S-X (collectively, the "SEC Financials"), together with
supplemental quarterly information, and (ii)   58    an unqualified
report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") on the SEC Financials, together
with PWC\'s consent to include the SEC Financials in Buyer\'s SEC filings.
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for up to $300,000 of the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses paid by Seller to PWC in connection with
the financial statements and related matters contemplated by this Section
8.10, and Seller shall be responsible for such costs and expenses in excess
of $300,000. Each of Seller and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is
their intention for the SEC Financials and the related supplemental quarterly
information to be prepared in accordance with (A) GAAP on a basis consistent
with the principles historically applied by Seller and (B) the requirements
of Regulation S-X.   (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give to Buyer and any of its Affiliates such assistance
as shall reasonably be requested by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
connection with any private placement or any registration or registered
offering of any security or any periodic report required by applicable
Requirements of Law. Any out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller in connection
with the foregoing shall promptly be reimbursed by Buyer.   Section 8.11
Mortgages and Other Encumbrances. Prior to Closing or within a reasonable
time thereafter, Seller shall obtain either a release or discharge of (or

over) any mortgage, deed of trust or deed to secure debt granted by Seller or
any Company and encumbering Seller\'s or any Company\'s interest in the Owned
Real Estate. Seller shall, at the reasonable request of Buyer,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to obtain the
release of (or obtain the commitment of a title insurance company to provide
title insurance over) any judgment liens on Real Estate reflected in the
current title commitments set forth on Schedule 1.1(c). Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer to sign the necessary releases to obtain the release of
any other Encumbrances on the Assets; provided, however, that such action
shall not include any requirement of Seller or any of its Affiliates to make
any payments or offer or grant any accommodation or undertake any liability
or obligation (in each case financial or otherwise) to any third party
(including any Governmental Body) unless in the case of any cost or expense
incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates, Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
for such cost or expense arising from any action by Seller or such Affiliate
requested by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the failure to obtain any release, discharge or commitment pursuant
to this Section 8.11 shall not be a condition to Buyer\'s obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing contained
in this Section 8.11 shall relieve Seller of its obligations under, or be
deemed to satisfy the condition set forth in, Section 9.6.   Section 8.12

any warranty or the inaccuracy of any  representation of Seller contained in
this Agreement or the certificate  delivered by or on behalf of Seller
pursuant to Section 9.5 (for purposes  of this Section 11.1(a)(i), other than
with respect to Sections 5.20 and  5.23, such representations and warranties
shall be read without reference  to qualifications as to materiality,
including the words "material" and  "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein);   (ii) any breach by Seller of, or failure by Seller to perform,
any  of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement; and  
(iii) the Excluded Liabilities;  provided, however, that Seller shall be
required to indemnify and hold harmless under Section 11.1(a)(i) with respect
to Losses and Expenses incurred by Buyer Group Members only to the extent
that:   (x) the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by Buyer Group Members 
related to each individual claim exceeds $65,000 (in which event, subject  to
clauses (y) and (z) below, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for the full  amount
of such Loss and Expense (including the initial $65,000));   (y) the
aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (other than  Losses and Expenses
excluded by clause (x) above) exceeds $10,000,000 (in  which case, subject to
clause (z) below, Seller shall indemnify Buyer only  for all Losses and
Expenses in excess of $10,000,000); and   61     (z) the aggregate
amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to  Section 11.1(a)(i) shall

thereafter), except that the indemnification by Seller shall continue as
to:   (i) the covenants of Seller set forth in Sections 8.9 and 13.6, 
which shall survive for 180 days following the period of time set forth 
therein;   (ii) the representation set forth in Section 5.3(a) and the 
covenants of Seller set forth in Articles II and III and Sections 8.2,  8.3,
8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.8, 8.11 and 13.12, which shall survive until the  expiration
of the relevant statutory period of limitations applicable to  the underlying
claim, giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension  thereof; and  
(iii) any Losses or Expenses of which any Buyer Group Member has  validly
given a Claim Notice to Seller in accordance with the requirements  of
Section 11.3 on or prior to the date such indemnification would  otherwise
terminate in accordance with this Section 11.1(b), as to which  the
obligation of Seller shall continue solely with respect to the  specific
matters in such Claim Notice until the liability of Seller shall  have been
determined pursuant to this Article XI, and Seller shall have  reimbursed all
Buyer Group Members for the full amount of such Losses and  Expenses that are
payable with respect to such Claim Notice in accordance  with this Article
XI.   Section 11.2 Indemnification by Buyer. (a) From and after
the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group
Member from and against any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by such
Seller Group Member in connection with or arising from:   (i) any breach of
any warranty or the inaccuracy of any  representation of Buyer contained in
this Agreement or the certificate  delivered by or on behalf of Buyer

qualifications as to materiality, including the  word "material" set forth
therein);   (ii) any breach by Buyer of, or failure by Buyer to perform, any

required to indemnify and hold harmless under Section 11.2(a)(i) with respect
to Losses and Expenses incurred by Seller Group Members only to the extent
that:   (x) the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by Seller Group
Members  related to each individual claim exceeds $65,000 (in which event,
subject  to clauses (y) and (z) below, Buyer shall indemnify Seller for the
full  amount of such Loss and Expense (including the initial $65,000));  
(y) the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses (other than  Losses and
Expenses excluded by clause (x) above) exceeds $10,000,000 (in  which case,
subject to clause (z) below, Buyer shall indemnify Seller only  for all
Losses and Expenses in excess of $10,000,000); and   (z) the aggregate
amount required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to  Section 11.2(a)(i) shall not
exceed $60,000,000.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the limitations
set forth in clauses (x), (y) and (z) above shall apply with respect to
Buyer\'s indemnification obligations relating to Section 6.2(a).   (b) The
indemnification provided for in Section 11.2(a) (excluding the
indemnification provided for in Section 11.2(a)(iii), which shall
survive indefinitely) shall terminate 12 months after the Closing Date (and
no claims shall be made by any Seller Group Member under Section 11.2(a)
thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as
to:   (i) the covenants of Buyer set forth in Section 13.6, which shall 
survive for 180 days following the period of time set forth therein;   (ii)
the representation set forth in Section 6.2(a), the covenants  of Buyer set
forth in Articles II and III and Sections 7.7, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3  8.5, 8.6, 8.8,
8.12 and 13.12, which shall survive until the expiration of  the relevant
statutory period of limitations applicable to the underlying  claim, giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof; and   (iii) any
Losses or Expenses of which any Seller Group Member has  validly given a
Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements  of Section 11.3 on
or prior to the date such indemnification would  otherwise terminate in
accordance with this Section 11.2(b), as to which  the obligation of Buyer
shall continue solely with respect to the specific  matters in such Claim
Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been  determined pursuant to
this Article XI, and Buyer shall have reimbursed  all Seller Group Members
for the full amount of such Losses and Expenses  that are payable with
respect to such Claim Notice in accordance with this  Article XI.   Section
11.3 Notice of Claims. Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall give promptly to
the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the
"Indemnitor") a notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to the claim for   63    indemnification hereunder and
shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method
of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision
of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed
hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based; provided,
however, that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in
equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will
be sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced.
The failure to give notice as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall
have been materially prejudiced by such failure.   Section 11.4
Determination of Amount. (a) In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall
be deducted any insurance recovery in respect thereof (and no right of
subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer). Each party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to make any such insurance recovery. Buyer
and Seller agree that, for purposes of computing the amount of any
indemnification payment under this Article XI, any such
indemnification payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes. If Seller is required to indemnify a Buyer Group
Member pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1, and the cost, expense or
liability for which the indemnification is sought under Section 11.1 has
provided any Buyer Group Member with a Tax benefit actually saved or
recovered, the amount of such Tax benefit that has been realized or received,
after taking into consideration all costs and expenses incurred in obtaining
such Tax savings, shall reduce Seller\'s liability to indemnify a Buyer Group
Member under Section 11.1.   (b) After the giving of any Claim Notice
pursuant to Section 11.3, the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Article XI shall be
determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed
final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal
shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof
in establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.   Section
11.5 Third Person Claims. (a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party shall notify
the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the third Person
claim within five business days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of
written notice of the third Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within 10 business days after
the Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitor relating to the
third Person claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be
physically served with a complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint
within five business days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the
Indemnitor within 10 business days after the receipt of such complaint copies
of notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the third Person claim. The failure to give notice as
provided in this Section 11.5 shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially
prejudiced by such failure.   64     (b) In the event any legal
proceeding shall be threatened or instituted or any claim or demand shall be
asserted by any Person in respect of which payment may be sought by one party
hereto from the other party under the provisions of this Article XI, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
such claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be
forwarded to the Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall
contain a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection
herewith upon which such claim is based, the facts giving rise to an alleged
basis for the claim and (if then known) the amount of the liability asserted
against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event of the initiation
of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the
Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of
notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel
of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any proceeding, claim or demand which relates to any loss,
liability or damage indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of
its choice and at its expense. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of
any such legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor
elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or demand (or fails to assume the
defense of such proceeding, claim or demand within a reasonable time period),
and the Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals with any such
proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel of its
choice, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such
proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any
such proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to
perform obligations or to admit liability without the consent of the other
party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. After any final judgment
or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to
appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by
the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter
and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified
Party by wire transfer, certified or bank cashier\'s check within 10 business
days after the date of such notice.   Section 11.6 Limitations. (a) In any
case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any amount in
respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has indemnified it
pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over
to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full
amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnitor to
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any
amount expended by the Indemnitor in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.   (b) EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THIRD-PERSON CLAIMS, IN
NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
(INCLUDING LOSS OF REVENUES OR PROFITS), EXEMPLARY OR   65    PUNITIVE
DAMAGES ARISING UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY OR ARISING UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED BY
AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ANY PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.   (c) Except
for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and injunctive and
provisional relief (including specific performance), if the Closing occurs,
this Article XI shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto for
breaches of this Agreement (including any covenant,
obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of
the sale of the Assets contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action of such party
against the other party arising under this Agreement or under any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement as a matter of equity or under or based
upon any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation (including those relating to Environmental
Laws) or arising under or based upon common law or otherwise, except that
this Section 11.6(c) shall not limit the remedies of a party with respect to
a claim based on fraud.   Section 11.7 Mitigation. Each of the parties
agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses and
Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and Expenses that are
indemnifiable hereunder.   ARTICLE XII  TERMINATION   Section 12.1
Termination. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:   (a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;   (b) by
Seller upon 10 business days\' notice to Buyer if any of the conditions in
Article X shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the Closing and shall
not have been waived in writing by Seller, provided that Seller\'s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(b) shall not be
available to Seller if Seller\'s failure to fulfill any of its obligations
contained in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the conditions of Article X to be capable of fulfillment at
the Closing;   (c) by Buyer upon 10 business days\' notice to Seller if any
of the conditions in Article IX shall have become incapable of fulfillment at
the Closing and shall not have been waived in writing by Buyer, provided
that Buyer\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
12.1(c) shall not be available to Buyer if Buyer\'s failure to fulfill any of
its obligations contained in this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the conditions of Article IX to be capable of
fulfillment at the Closing;   66     (d) by Buyer or Seller if any court
or other Governmental Body having jurisdiction over Buyer or Seller shall
have issued a final and non-appealable order, decree or ruling permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the purchase and sale of any
material portion of the Assets; or   (e) by Buyer or Seller if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before August 1, 2005 (or such later date as
may be agreed to in writing to Buyer and Seller); provided, however, that
either party may by written notice to the other party delivered on or before
August 1, 2005 extend such date until any date prior to December 31, 2005 if
the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before August 1, 2005 shall
have resulted from the failure of the condition set forth in Sections 9.1 and
10.1 and provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 12.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any of its obligations contained in this Agreement has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or prior
to the aforesaid dates.   Section 12.2 Notice of Termination. Any party
desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1 shall give
written notice of such termination to the other party to this Agreement.

to this Article XII, all further obligations of the parties under
this Agreement (other than this Section 12.3 (Effect of Termination), Section
8.6 (Fees and Expenses), and Article XIII (Miscellaneous), which provisions
shall each survive such termination) shall terminate; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 12.3 shall relieve any party from any liability for a
willful breach of this Agreement.   ARTICLE XIII  MISCELLANEOUS  
Section 13.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing only for
the period during which an indemnification claim is permitted to be made
pursuant to Article XI, after which time such representations and warranties
shall terminate and the parties shall have no rights or remedies thereafter
with respect to any breach of such representations or warranties.   Section
13.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law
provisions) of the State of New York.   Section 13.3 No Public Announcement.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall, without the approval of the other, make any
press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such
party shall be so obligated by law, in which case the other party shall be
advised and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures
necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with SEC
disclosure obligations or the rules of any United States or foreign stock

setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in any schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in
any   69    representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item in any schedule hereto is intended to
imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in
the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in any schedule is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of this Agreement.   Section 13.9 Waivers.
Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its
performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit
thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the
purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing
by an authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party
hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be
construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the
validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach.   Section 13.10 Partial Invalidity. Wherever
possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the
provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.   Section 13.11 Execution
in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to Seller and Buyer.   Section 13.12 Further Assurances. From time
to time following the Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and
transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to
more effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in
possession of, any part of the Assets; provided, however, that Section 2.2
shall govern with respect to approvals, consents and waivers required in
connection with the transfer of Contracts, Warranties and Purchase Orders.
From time to time following the Closing, Buyer shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, to Seller such other instruments of
assumption as Seller may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary
to evidence the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.   Section
13.13 Disclaimer of Warranties. Seller makes no representations or warranties
with respect to any projections, forecasts or forward-looking information
provided to Buyer. There is no assurance that any projected or forecasted
results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATE
DELIVERED BY   70    SELLER PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.4(c), SELLER IS
SELLING THE ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO FITNESS, NONINFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor any of its
representatives or any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any memoranda,
charts or summaries heretofore made available by Seller or its
representatives to Buyer or any other information which is not included in
this Agreement or the Schedules hereto, and neither Seller nor any of its
representatives or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability
to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person resulting from the
distribution of any such information to, or use of any such information
by, Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their agents, consultants,
accountants, counsel or other representatives.   Section 13.14 Specific
Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.   Section 13.15 Waiver of Jury
Trial. Each party hereto waives the right to a trial by jury in any
litigation, proceeding or other legal action in connection with or relating
to this Agreement, any Company Ancillary Agreement, any Seller Ancillary
Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.   71     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have
caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above
written.   SAKS INCORPORATED   By: /s/ DOUGLAS E. COLTHARP
