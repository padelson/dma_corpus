<TABLE>
<S>                                                      <C>

                                                          ---------------
                  Base Price                             $ 255,700,000.00
</TABLE>

       The Notional Interest shall be allocated to the Petroleum and Natural Gas
       Rights.

<PAGE>


                                      -11-



       The Purchaser  shall be  solely liable for  any and all sales and similar
       taxes  imposed by  provincial  or federal  legislation in  respect of the
       acquisition  of the  Assets pursuant  hereto  (including,  if applicable,
       British Columbia Social Services Tax).  If the Vendor  is required by law
       to collect such taxes,  the Purchaser  shall pay such taxes to the Vendor
       at Closing.  The Vendor shall  remit the taxes  collected by it  pursuant
       to this  Clause  to the appropriate  authorities in  accordance  with the
       applicable legislation.

       After Closing,  the Purchaser will be responsible for,  and indemnify and
       save the  Vendor harmless in  respect of,  any amounts  of GST  and sales
       and similar taxes  (including interest and penalties) which the Purchaser
       is liable to  pay in  respect  of the  acquisition of the Assets pursuant
       hereto which are in excess  of the  amounts collected  by the Vendor from
       the Purchaser at Closing on account of such taxes.

3.04   The Vendor acknowledges that  the Purchaser has paid the Vendor a deposit
       of five (5%)  percent of the Base Price  which shall  be deemed to accrue
       interest at the Prime Rate from  (and including) the date  hereof to (but
       excluding)  the Closing Date.  The  Deposit  Amount  shall  be applied in
       accordance with the following terms:

       (a) if Closing occurs, the Deposit Amount paid shall be applied to
           payment of the Purchase Price;

       (b) if Closing  does not  occur due  to a breach of this Agreement by the
           Purchaser,  the Deposit Amount  shall be  forfeited  to the Vendor on
           account of the damages  suffered  by the Vendor  as a  consequence of
           such breach.  The Parties  agree that  an amount equal to ten percent
           (10%) of the Base Price constitutes their genuine pre-estimate of the
           damages  which  will be  suffered  by the  Vendor  by virtue  of such
           breach; and

       (c) if Closing  does not occur  for any reason or circumstance other than
           that described in  Subclause 3.04(b),  the  Vendor  shall  refund the
           Deposit Amount to the Purchaser.

3.05   The Purchase  Price  and  the GST  and other  taxes  payable  at  Closing
       pursuant to  Clause 3.03 less  the Deposit  Amount  shall be  paid by the
       Purchaser  to  the   Vendor  at  the   Closing  Time,   per  the  written
       instructions of Vendor, by wire  transfer of immediately  available funds
       to the Vendor.

       shall occur  at the  Closing Time  and be  effective as  of the Effective
       Time. The Vendor will  be responsible to cause  the payment  of all costs
       incurred  prior  to  the   Effective  Time  and  the  Purchaser  will  be

            attributable  to  the Assets  which  accrue  at the  time  that  the
            Petroleum Substances are processed, compressed, treated, gathered or
            transported therein;

       (e)  amounts payable  by the  Parties on account of royalties and similar

            Parties in respect of the custom processing, compression, treatment,
            gathering or  transportation  of Petroleum  Substances produced from

            comprised in the Assets, taxes levied with respect  to the Assets or
            operations in respect  thereof  and  prepaid expenses  will be costs
            attributable  to the  Assets and  will be  apportioned on a per diem
            basis as of the Effective Time;

       (g)  amounts payable  by a  Party to  an operator under a joint operating
            agreement   on   account  of  the  operator's  recoverable  overhead
            (including,  where  a Party  is the  operator,  the  amount  of  the
            recoverable overhead attributable to such  Party's working interest)
            shall be costs  related to  the Assets which accrue in the period to

       (l)  except as  provided in paragraph(k), no adjustments shall be made in

 4.03   An interim accounting  of the adjustments  required under Clause 4.02 in
        respect of the period from the  Effective Time to  the Closing Date will
        be made at Closing,  based on the  Vendor's good faith estimate of costs
        paid by the Vendor prior to Closing and  revenues received by the Vendor
        prior to Closing.  The Vendor  shall provide  a statement  setting forth
        such estimates  not later  than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing
        and shall assist  the Purchaser  in verifying  the amounts  set forth in
        such statement.

4.04    The Parties  shall make  further adjustments  in accordance  with Clause
        4.02  following  the  Closing as  and when  they  are  ascertained.  The
        Parties  shall  meet  approximately  one hundred  and twenty  (120) days
        after the Closing  Date to finalize,  to the extent reasonably possible,
        the adjustments  pursuant to  Clause 4.03.  In  any  event,  subject  to
        Clause 4.05, the Parties shall not be obligated to make an adjustment in
        accordance with Clause 4.02 more than one (1)  year after Closing unless
        such adjustment has been  specifically  requested,  by  written  notice,
        within such period.

4.05    During the  one (1)  year period following the Closing Date, a Party may
        audit the books, records and  accounts of the other Party respecting the
        Assets,  for the  purpose of  effecting  adjustments  pursuant  to  this
        Article.  Such audits  shall be  conducted upon reasonable notice to the
        Party being audited and at the cost of the auditing Party.

4.06    Notwithstanding  Clause 4.04,  the Parties  will be  required to make an
        adjustment in accordance  with Clause 4.02 more than  one (1) year after
        Closing if:

        (a)  the adjustment is required by a Crown royalty audit commenced prior
             to or within four (4) years after Closing and a written request for
             the adjustment is given by one Party to  the other Party within 120
             days of its receipt of the results of the audit;

        (b)  the  adjustment is  required  by a  joint venture  audit  commenced
             within the  term permitted under  the governing Title and Operating
             Document and a written request  for the adjustment  is given by one
             Party to the other  Party within one hundred  and twenty (120) days
             of its receipt of the final results of the audit; or

        (c)  the adjustment  is required  by a  13  month  adjustment  generated
             within the  term permitted under the  governing Title and Operating
             Documents and  written request for such  adjustment is given by one
             Party to the other  Party within one hundred  and twenty (120) days
             of its  receipt  of the  notice of  the 13  month  adjustment  (for
             purposes of the foregoing, a "13 month adjustment"  is a payment or


<PAGE>


                                      -14-


             refund which  arises when payments or  revenues under  an agreement
             are initially based upon an estimate of annual costs or revenues or
             both and  an adjustment  is made  following  the  annual  period to
             reflect differences between the estimates and actual amounts).

4.07    An adjustment payable by a Party after Closing pursuant hereto which is
        not paid within  thirty (30) days  of a written request for payment from
        the other Party,  shall bear  interest at the  Prime Rate payable by the
        paying Party  to the  other Party  from the end  of such thirty (30) day
        period until the adjustment is paid.

4.08    The Vendor shall continue to invoice joint  interest owners for billable
        costs  attributable  to the  operations  pertaining  to the  Assets  for
        periods prior to the Closing  Date and  for the  month in  which Closing
        occurs and the Vendor  shall be entitled  to overhead  recoveries in its
        capacity as an operator for such  periods (including the  month in which
        Closing occurs).  Subsequent  joint interest  billings shall be prepared
        and  distributed  by the  Purchaser.  For  a  period  of  one year after
        Closing, the Parties shall  provide reasonable assistance  to each other
        in the collection or  recoupment of  any overpayment  or underpayment of
        joint operations accounts receivable and royalties.

4.09    The Assets do not  include deposits  made by  the Vendor which relate to
        the Assets or cash call  advances,  operating fund  payments or  similar
        advances  made by  the Vendor  to an  operator  under a  joint operating
        agreement. Such amounts shall either be  returned to the  Vendor and (if
        required) replaced by  the Purchaser  or be transferred by the Vendor to
        the Purchaser,  in which event the  Purchaser shall reimburse the amount
        thereof to the Vendor.

4.10    No item of cost  or revenue will be  accounted for more than once in the
        adjustments made pursuant to this Article.

4.11    After Closing,  either  Party may,  at any time,  refer to arbitration a
        dispute  between the  Parties  respecting  the  requirement  for  or the
        amount of an adjustment pursuant to the provisions of this Article 4.

        industry practices  in western Canada,  to convey,  assign  and transfer
        the Vendor's  title to  the Assets  to the  Purchaser and  to novate the
        Purchaser into the Title and Operating Documents in the  place and stead
        of the Vendor with respect  to the Assets.  The Purchaser shall bear all
        costs incurred  in registering  such  conveyances  and  registering  any
        further assurances required to convey the Vendor's  title to  the Assets

5.03    The Vendor shall provide the  Purchaser with  originals of the Files and
        Records within one (1) day  following the Closing Time. The Vendor shall

6.   PURCHASER'S TITLE REVIEW
     ------------------------

6.01    Between the  date this Agreement is fully executed and the Closing Time,
        subject to contractual  and fiduciary obligations and limits, the Vendor
        shall provide the Purchaser and  its nominees  reasonable access  to the
        Vendor's records, files  and documents directly relating  to the Assets,
        at the Vendor's  office during normal business hours, for the purpose of
        the Purchaser's  review  of the  Assets and  the Vendor's title thereto,
        including, without limitation, the Title and Operating Documents.

6.02    The Purchaser  shall  conduct its  review of  the Vendor's  title to the
        Assets with reasonable diligence. Not later than ten  (10) days prior to
        the  Closing  Time  (determined without  reference to any  change in the
        Closing Time  pursuant to  Clause  6.04), the  Purchaser shall  give the
        Vendor written notice (the "Purchaser's Title Defects Notice")  of Title
        Defects which the Purchaser does  not waive.  Such notice shall  specify
        such  Title Defects  in reasonable detail,  the Assets directly affected
        thereby, the Purchaser's requirements  for the  rectification  or curing
        thereof and  the Purchaser's  estimate  of the reduction in the value of
        the Assets  resulting therefrom.  The Vendor  shall thereupon diligently
        make reasonable  efforts to cure  or remove such Title Defects not later
        than the  Closing Time  (determined  without reference  to any change in
        the Closing Time pursuant to Clause 6.04).

6.03    Insofar as the Title Defects described in  the Purchaser's Title Defects
        Notice  have not been  cured by  the Closing  Time  to  the  Purchaser's
        reasonable  satisfaction,  the Purchaser  may elect,  subject  to Clause
        6.04, at or  before the  Closing Time  (determined without  reference to
        any  change in the  Closing Time  pursuant to Clause 6.04), by notice to
        the Vendor, to do one of the following:

        (a)  waive the  uncured Title Defects and proceed with the completion of
             the transaction;

        (b)  if the  reduction in  the value  of the  Assets resulting  from the
             uncured Title Defects which it does not  waive is  more than  5% of
             the Base  Price,  require that  the  Base  Price be  reduced by the


<PAGE>


                                      -16-


             amount that the reduction in the value of the Assets resulting from
             such uncured and unwaived Title  Defects is greater  than 5% of the
             Base Price and,  in such event,  the Base Price shall be reduced by
             such amount,  provided that  if the  reduction in  the value of the
             Assets resulting from the uncured,  unwaived Title  Defects exceeds
             20% of the Base Price, the Vendor will have the right, at or before
             the Closing Time,  to terminate this  Agreement in its  entirety in
             accordance with Article 13 and the Deposit Amount shall be returned
             to the Purchaser; or

        (c)  if the  reduction in  the value  of the  Assets resulting  from the
             uncured  Title  Defects  that the  Purchaser does  not waive  is in
             excess of  20% of the  Base Price,  terminate this Agreement in its
             entirety in accordance with Article 13 and the Deposit Amount shall
             be returned to the Purchaser.

        Failure by the Purchaser to  make such election at or before the Closing
        Time shall  be deemed  to be an election pursuant  to Subclause 6.03(a).
        If the reduction in the value of the  Assets resulting  from the uncured
        and unwaived  Title Defects  is equal  to or  less than  5% of  the Base
        Price, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived the Title Defects.

6.04    If there is a dispute in relation to Clause 6.03 regarding the existence
        of a Title Defect,  whether it  has been  cured or  the reduction in the
        value of the Assets resulting from a Title Defect, either Party may,  at
        any time prior to the occurrence of Closing as then scheduled, refer the
        determination thereof  to arbitration in accordance with  Article 14 and
        the following:

             Defect, the arbitrator shall be a  recognized oil and gas lawyer in
             private practice in Calgary,  Alberta who does not represent either
             Party;

        (b)  if the arbitration is with respect to the reduction in the value of
             the Assets resulting from a Title Defect, the arbitrator shall be a

             carrying on business in Calgary, Alberta;

        (c)  each  Party  shall  be  required  to  submit  a  written  statement
             respecting the matter to the arbitrator not later than two Business
             Days after  the arbitrator  is appointed,  including  such  Party's
             proposed resolution and if a Party fails  to do so, the  arbitrator
             shall be required to accept the proposal of the other Party;

        (d)  the Purchaser's  submissions to the  arbitrator shall be consistent
             with the elections and  notices provided  by it pursuant to Clauses
             6.02 and 6.03,  both as to  the existence of Title  Defects and the
             reductions in the value of the Assets resulting therefrom;

        (e)  the arbitrator shall be instructed to render its decision not later
             than five (5) Business Days after its appointment;

        (f)  the Closing Time shall be postponed until  10:00 a.m. on  the third
             Business  Day after the  decision of  the arbitrator is rendered to
             the Parties;

        (g)  if,  after  application  of the  decision  of the  arbitrator,  the
             reduction in the  value of  the Assets  resulting from  the uncured
             Title Defects  which the  Purchaser does not waive at or before the
             Closing Time  (determined without reference  to any  change  in the
             Closing Time pursuant to  Clause 6.04) is  greater than 20%  of the
             Base Price  and at or  before the  Closing Time (determined without
             reference to  any change  in the  Closing Time  pursuant to  Clause
             6.04)  a  Party had  elected  pursuant  to  Subclause  6.04(c),  to
             terminate  this  Agreement  in its  entirety,  this Agreement shall
             terminate in its  entirety in  accordance with  Article 13  and the
             Deposit Amount shall be returned to the Purchaser; and

        (h)  if the arbitrator  accepts the proposal of the Vendor, the Notional
             Interest  shall be computed  until the  date upon which the Closing
             actually occurs and the Purchaser  shall pay the  fees and expenses
             of the arbitrator and if the arbitrator selects the proposal of the
             Purchaser, the Notional Interest shall be calculated only until the
             date that the Closing would have  occurred but for such arbitration
             and the Vendor shall pay the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.

        promptly serve all  notices as  are required  in respect  of the ROFR or

             Assets pursuant to Clause 7.02; and

             purpose for  which they  are being used,  reasonable wear  and tear
             excepted, and to the  knowledge of the Vendor,  the Vendor  has not
             received any  notice that  the Tangibles operated by third parties,
             if any, are not in good and  operable condition for the purpose for
             which they are being used, reasonable wear and tear excepted;

        (r)  Drilling Obligations:  To the knowledge of the Vendor,  no material
             obligations  have  accrued  pursuant  to  the  Title and  Operating
             Documents that  may be satisfied  by the  drilling  of a well,  the
             payment of compensatory  royalty or the surrender of some or all of
             the interests granted, reserved  or otherwise conferred pursuant to
             the Title and Operating Documents, other than obligations that have
             been satisfied (by means  other than by the payment of compensatory
             royalties) or have been permanently waived;

        (s)  Areas  of  Mutual  Interest:  There  are  no  active area of mutual
             interest provisions in  any of the Title and Operating Documents or
             other agreements or documents to which the Assets are subject; and

        (t)  Production  or Other  Penalties:  Excepting  production  limits  of
             general application  in the oil and gas industry, none of the Wells
             is subject to  production or  other penalties  imposed by the Title
             and Operating Documents or by any other agreements and documents to
             which the Assets are subject, or by the Regulations,.

8.03    The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Vendor that:

        (a)  Investment Canada:  the Purchaser is a Canadian for purposes of the
             Investment Canada Act.; and

        (b)  Financial Capacity:  the Purchaser  has made necessary arrangements
             so that at the  Closing  Time  the  Purchaser  will have  available
             sufficient  funds so  that it is able to pay the amounts payable by
             it at Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

8.04     The Vendor  makes no  representations  or warranties  to the  Purchaser
         other  than those expressly  enumerated in Clauses  8.01 and 8.02.  The
         Vendor does  not warrant  or make  representations  or warranties  with
         respect to:

        (a)  except as  specifically set forth in  Subclause (a) of Clause 8.02,
             title to the Assets;

        (b)  the quantity or quality of  Petroleum  Substances  recoverable from
             the Lands;

        (c)  any estimates of the value of the Assets or the revenues applicable
             to future production from the Lands;

        (d)  any engineering,  geological  or other interpretations or  economic
             evaluations respecting the Assets;

        (e)  the rates of  production of  Petroleum  Substances from  the Lands;

        (f)  the quality,  condition or  serviceability of  any of the Assets or
             the suitability of their use for any purpose ; or

        (g)  except  as  set  forth  in  Subclause  8.02(j),  any  Environmental
             Liabilities.

        Further  without  restricting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  the
        Purchaser   acknowledges  that   it  has   made  its   own   independent
        investigation, analysis, evaluation and inspection of the Assets and the
        state  and  condition  thereof and  that it  has relied  solely  on such
        investigation, analysis,  evaluation and inspection as to its assessment
        of the condition, quantum and value of  the Assets and is purchasing the
        Assets on an "as is, where is" basis.

8.05    Each Party  acknowledges that the  other may rely on the representations
        and warranties made by  such Party  pursuant to  Clauses 8.01,  8.02 and
        8.03. The representations and warranties contained in Clauses 8.01, 8.02
        and 8.03 shall  be true at  the Effective Time  and at the Closing Time,
        and  the  representations  and  warranties of  both the  Vendor  and the


<PAGE>


                                      -23-


        Purchaser  shall continue  to be  in full  force and  effect  and  shall
        survive the Effective Time for a period of one (1) year, for the benefit
        of the Party for which such representations and warranties were made. In
        the absence of fraud,  however,  no claim or  action shall be  commenced
        with respect to a breach of any such representation or warranty, unless,
        within such period,  written notice specifying such breach in reasonable
        detail has been  provided to the Party which made such representation or
        warranty.

9.   LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION
     -----------------------------

9.01    Subject to other provisions of this Article 9 and provided Closing has
        occurred and the Vendor has received payment from the Purchaser of the
        Purchase Price, as adjusted, pursuant to Clause 4., the Vendor shall:

        (a)  indemnify and save harmless the Purchaser and its Other Indemnitees
             from and against all Losses and Liabilities which the Purchaser and
             its  Other  Indemnitees   suffer,  sustain,  pay  or  incur   as  a
             consequence of  a breach of  a representation  and warranty made by
             the Vendor in Clause 8.01 or 8.02 or a breach by the  Vendor of any
             of the covenants made by it in this Agreement; and

        (b)  be liable for,  and indemnify and  save harmless the  Purchaser and
             its Other Indemnitees from and against, all Claims made against the
             Purchaser and its Other Indemnitees as a consequence of a breach of
             a representation  and warranty made by the Vendor in Clause 8.01 or
             8.02 or a breach by the Vendor  of any of the covenants  made by it
             in  this  Agreement  and  all  Losses  and  Liabilities  which  the
             Purchaser and its  Other Indemnitees suffer,  sustain, pay or incur
             as a consequence of such Claims;

        except  to  the   extent  reimbursed  (or  reimbursable)   by  insurance
        maintained by the Purchaser or caused by  the gross negligence or wilful
        misconduct  of the  Purchaser or  its Other  Indemnitees.  The indemnity
        granted by the Vendor herein, however, is not a title warranty and shall
        not provide any remedy in respect of Losses suffered by the Purchaser or
        its Other  Indemnitees or  its successors  or  assigns as  a result of a
        failure of  title  to the  Assets  or an  encumbrance or  Burden  on the
        Assets.

9.02    The Purchaser shall:

        (a)  indemnify and  save harmless the  Vendor and  its Other Indemnitees
             from and against all  Losses and  Liabilities which the  Vendor and
             its  Other  Indemnitees   suffer,   sustain,  pay  or  incur  as  a
             consequence of a  breach of a  representation and  warranty made by
             the Purchaser in Clause  8.01 or 8.03 or a breach by the  Purchaser
             of any of the covenants made by it in this Agreement;

        (b)  be liable for,  and indemnify and save  harmless the Vendor and its
             Other Indemnitees  from and  against,  all Claims made  against the
             Vendor and its Other Indemnitees  as a consequence of a breach of a
             representation and warranty made by the Purchaser in Clause 8.01 or
             8.03 or a breach by the Purchaser  of any of the  covenants made by
             it in this  Agreement  and all  Losses and  Liabilities  which  the


<PAGE>


                                      -24-



             Vendor and its Other Indemnitees  suffer, sustain, pays or incur as
             a consequence of such Claims; and

        (c)  if Closing occurs,  be liable for,  and indemnify and save harmless
             the Vendor and its Other  Indemnitees from and against,  all Claims
             made  against  the Vendor and  its Other  Indemnitees  by a  person
             (other than a Party) in respect of a  matter relating to the Assets
             which  occurs on  or after  the  Closing  Date  and  all Losses and
             Liabilities  which the  Vendor and  its Other  Indemnitees  suffer,
             sustain,  pay or  incur as a  consequence of such Claims other than
             anything directly related to or connected with the 3-32 Well;

        except  to  the  extent  reimbursed  (or   reimbursable)  by   insurance
        maintained by  the Vendor  or caused  by the  gross negligence or wilful
        misconduct of the Vendor.

9.03    The Purchaser is not relying upon any  representation or warranty of the
        Vendor as to the  condition,  environmental or otherwise, of the Assets,
        except  as  is   specifically  made  pursuant  to   Subclause   8.02(j).
        Notwithstanding Clause 9.01,  but subject to the Purchaser's right under
        this  Article  9 in  respect  of  the  representation  and  warranty  in
        Subclause  8.02(j),  the  Purchaser  further  agrees  that,  if  Closing
        occurs, the Purchaser shall:

        (a)  be solely liable and responsible for; and

        (b)  indemnify and  save the  Vendor and its  Other Indemnitees harmless
             from any  and all  Losses they  suffer,  sustain,  pay or  incur in
             respect of

         all Environmental  and Reclamation Liabilities (whether related to acts
         or omissions  occurring  before,  on  or  after  the  Effective  Time),
         including, without  limitation, damage from  or removal of hazardous or
         toxic substances,  pollution,  clean-up,  abandonment  of the Wells and
         reclamation , but excluding anything  directly related to or  connected
         with the 3-32 Well.

9.04     The indemnification obligations of Vendor under Clause 9.01 are subject
         to the following restrictions and limitations:

        (a)  The  Purchaser shall  not be  entitled to seek indemnification from
             the  Vendor  pursuant  to  Clause  9.01  in  respect  of  any  act,
             omission,  circumstance  or  other  matter  actually  known  to the
             Purchaser prior  to or at Closing  or any  matter disclosed  in the
             Data Room.

        (b)  No claim by the Purchaser shall be made against the Vendor pursuant
             to Clause 9.01 in  respect of Vendor's breach of any representation
             or  warranty in  Clause 8.01  or 8.02  or a  covenant contained  in
             Clause  10.01,  10.02  10.03  or  unless  the  aggregate of  all of
             Purchaser's Losses  in respect of all of  breaches of the  Vendor's
             representations  or warranties  in  Clauses  8.01 and  8.02 and the
             covenants contained in Clauses 10.01,  10.02 and 10.03  exceeds the
             Indemnity Threshold. If the total amount of all such Losses exceeds
             the  Indemnity  Threshold,   then  the  Vendor's   obligations  for


<PAGE>


                                      -25-



             Purchaser's Losses under Clause 9.01 shall be limited to the amount
             by which  the aggregate amount  of all of  such Losses  exceeds the
             Indemnity Threshold.

        (c)  In no event  shall the  Vendor be  liable  for  Purchaser's  Losses
             pursuant to Clause 9.01 after Closing in respect of all of breaches
             of the Vendor's representations and  warranties in Clauses 8.01 and
             8.02 and the covenants  contained in Clauses 10.01, 10.02 and 10.03
             on an aggregate basis for more than the Base Price.

        (d)  The Purchaser  shall not  be entitled  to seek indemnification from
             the Vendor pursuant  to Clause 9.01  in respect of a  breach of the
             Vendor's representations or warranties  in Clause 8.01 or 8.02 or a
             covenant  contained in  Clause  10.01,  10.02 or  10.03  unless the
             Purchaser shall  have  provided  the Vendor  with a  notice of  its
             claim in respect thereof within 12 months after the Closing Date.

9.05    The Vendor  shall not  be entitled  to  seek  indemnification  from  the
        Purchaser  pursuant  to  Clause  9.02  in  respect  of  breaches  of the
        Purchaser's  representations  or warranties  in Clause  8.01  unless the
        Vendor shall have  provided the Purchaser with  a notice of its claim in
        respect thereof within 12 months after the Closing Date.

9.06    Notwithstanding  anything to  the contrary  set forth in this Agreement,
        neither  Party  shall  have any  liability  to the  other Party  for any
        incidental,  special, indirect  or consequential damages suffered by the
        other Party or its successors or assigns.

9.07    A Party's  sole remedy  for a misrepresentation or breach of a warranty,
        covenant or other  agreement contained  in this  Agreement is limited to
        the indemnity  contained  in  Clause  9.01 or 9.02  (as  applicable)  as
        limited by the other provisions of this Article 9.

9.08    The following  procedures shall be applicable to any claim by a Party or
        any of its Additional Indemnitees (the "Indemnitee") for indemnification
        pursuant to  this Agreement  from the  other Party (the "Indemnitor") in
        respect of a claim by a third party:

        (a)  upon the  third party claim being made against or commenced against
             the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall within 10 Business Days of its
             receipt  thereof provide  notice thereof  to  the  Indemnitor.  The
             notice shall describe  the third party  claim in  reasonable detail
             and  indicate   the  estimated  amount,   if  practicable,  of  the
             indemnifiable  Losses  that  has been  or may  be sustained  by the
             Indemnitee in respect thereof.  If the Indemnitee  does not provide
             notice to the Indemnitor  within such 10 Business Day period,  then
             such failure shall  only lessen or limit the Indemnitee's rights to
             indemnity  hereunder  to the  extent that the  defence of the third
             party claim was prejudiced by such lack of timely notice;

        (b)  if the  Indemnitor  acknowledges  to the Indemnitee in writing that
             the  Indemnitor  is responsible  to  indemnify  the  Indemnitee  in
             respect of  the third  party claim pursuant  hereto, the Indemnitor
             shall have the right to do either or both of the following:

              (i)   assume  carriage  of the  defence of  the third party  claim
                    using legal  counsel  of its  choice and  at its  sole cost;
                    and/or


<PAGE>


                                      -26-



              (ii)  settle the  third party  claim  provided the Indemnitor pays
                    the  full  monetary  amount  of   the  settlement   and  the
                    settlement does not impose any restrictions  or  obligations
                    on the Indemnitee;

        (c)  the Indemnitee and  the Indemnitor  shall co-operate with the other
             in the defence of the third party claim, including making available
             to  the  other  Party,  its   directors,  officers,  employees  and
             consultants whose assistance, testimony  or presence is of material
             assistance in evaluation and defending the third party claim;

        (d)  the Indemnitee  shall  not enter into any settlement, consent order
             or other compromise with respect  to the third  party claim without
             the prior written  consent of  the Indemnitor  (which consent shall
             not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  unless the  Indemnitee
             waives its rights to indemnification in respect  of the third party
             claim;

        (e)  upon payment  of the  third party  claim, the  Indemnitor  shall be
             subrogated  to all claims the Indemnitee may have relating thereto.
             The Indemnitee  shall give  such  further assurances and co-operate
             with  the  Indemnitor  to  permit  the  Indemnitor  to pursue  such
             subrogated claims as reasonably requested by it; and

        (f)  if  the   Indemnitor   has   paid  an   amount  pursuant   to   the
             indemnification  obligations   herein  and   the  Indemnitee  shall
             subsequently be  reimbursed from any source in respect of the third
             party claim  from any  other Person,  the Indemnitee shall promptly
             pay the amount of the  reimbursement  (including interest  actually
             received) to  the Indemnitor,  net of  Taxes required to be paid by
             the Indemnitee as a result of any such receipt.

10.      MAINTENANCE OF BUSINESS
         -----------------------

10.01    Between the date hereof and the Closing Time, the Vendor shall,  to the
         extent that the  nature of  its  interests  permit  and  subject to the
         Title and Operating  Documents:

        (a)  maintain the  Assets in  a proper and  prudent manner in accordance
             with good oil and gas industry practices and in material compliance
             with the Regulations;

        (b)  pay or cause  to be paid  all costs relating  to the Assets as they
             become due;

        (c)  perform and comply with  all covenants and conditions  contained in

             documents to which the Assets are subject;

        (d)  not enter into  or authorize any material contractual commitment or
             transaction or any material  variation of  existing commitments  or

        (e)  conduct its business relating to  the Assets in the  normal course,
             consistent with its past practices.

         Vendor shall  maintain the property damage  insurance respecting of the
         Assets currently  in effect and  all other insurance  it is required to
         maintain pursuant to the Title and Operating Documents.

10.02    During the  period from  the date of  execution of this Agreement until
         Closing Time, the Vendor shall not,  without the prior  written consent
         of the Purchaser,  assume any obligations or commitments or  propose or
         initiate  any  operations  (in  either  event  to the  extent exceeding
         $50,000 for any one item) with respect to the Assets, unless and to the
         extent that the Vendor reasonably determines that  such expenditures or
         actions are necessary for the  protection of life or property, in which
         case the Vendor shall  promptly notify the  Purchaser of such intention
         or  actions  and  the  Vendor's  estimate  of the  costs  and  expenses
         associated therewith.

10.03    The Vendor  shall  permit  the Purchaser  and  its  legal  counsel  and
         authorized representatives  to have  access to the Assets to the extent
         the Vendor has the  right to provide such  access and  to  the Vendor's
         books,  records and files,  in each  case,  upon  reasonable notice and
         during  normal   business  hours   prior  to-Closing  for  purposes  of
         performing  due diligence with  respect  to  the  Assets  for  purposes
         hereof. The provisions  of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
         to be  applicable  to any  information  made  available  by  the Vendor
         pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

10.04    Following Closing:

        (a)  the Vendor  shall hold  its  title  to an  Asset in  trust for  the
             Purchaser until  all  necessary  notifications,  registrations  and
             other steps required to transfer such  title to the  Purchaser have
             been completed; and

        (b)  the Vendor  shall represent  the Purchaser  in all  matters arising
             under  a  Title  and  Operating  Document  until  the  Purchaser is
             substituted as a party thereto in the place of the Vendor,  whether
             by novation, notice of assignment or otherwise and,  in furtherance
             thereof:

             (i)    all payments  relating to  the Assets received by the Vendor
                    pursuant to the  Title and  Operating  Document,  other than
                    those to which the Vendor is entitled under Article 4, shall
                    be received  and held  by the  Vendor as  a  trustee for the
                    Purchaser and the Vendor promptly remitted to the Purchaser;

                    Assets as the Vendor may reasonably request.

10.05   If Closing occurs,  the Vendor shall be deemed to have been the agent of
        the Purchaser with respect to the  maintenance of the Assets pursuant to
        this Article  and the  Purchaser shall  be deemed  to have  ratified all
        actions  which the Vendor takes  or refrains  from taking as  authorized

        Indemnitees  suffer,  sustain, pay  or incur  as a  consequence  of such

        the gross negligence  or wilful  misconduct  of the Vendor  or its Other
        Indemnitees.   An  action  or  omission  of  the  Vendor  or  its  Other
        Indemnitees  shall  not  be  regarded  as  gross  negligence  or  wilful
        misconduct, however, to the extent it was done or omitted  to be done in
        accordance with the instructions of or with the concurrence of the
        Purchaser.

        thereof in accordance with the  Regulations and good oilfield  practices

        other minor  deficiencies  in the  application the  Vendor shall  within
        five (5) Business Days correct  the application and amend and  re-submit
        an application  for the  EUB License  Transfer  and the  Purchaser shall

        Non-Defaulting  Party  as  soon  as   possible  and  indemnify  the Non-
        Defaulting  Party for  the amount and costs of any draws on the security
        plus interest thereon at the Prime  Rate plus 2% from the date such draw
        is made  until such  indemnification is  made. In  addition to all other
        rights  to enforce  such reimbursement otherwise  available to  the Non-
        Defaulting Party,  it shall have the right to set-off the amount of such
        reimbursement  or  indemnification  (including  interest)  against other
        monies due to the Defaulting Party pursuant to this Agreement.

        on Closing occurring.

18.02   Purchaser covenants and agrees to use and disclose  Personal Information
        only for those purposes for which the Personal Information was initially

        holding interests  in the Purchaser's  joint properties  on a  view-only
        basis. The Purchaser  shall take all  reasonable actions to  prevent the
        disclosure to  third parties of the Seismic Data that is licensed to the
