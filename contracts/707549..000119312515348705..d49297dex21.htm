WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of

provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") will

VII_ to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived (other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

Company or Merger Sub 1 under the DGCL in connection with the First Merger
and, thereafter, (b) a certificate of merger with respect to the Second Merger
(the " _Second Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with
the DSOS as provided under the DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or
publications required to be made by the First Surviving Corporation or Merger
Sub 2 under the DGCL in connection with the Second Merger. The First Merger

by the Company and Parent and specified in the First Certificate of Merger
(such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the " _First Effective
Time_ "). The Second Merger shall become effective at such time as the Second
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the DSOS or on such other date and
time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in

Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.6 _Plan of Reorganization_. The Parties intend that, for U.S.

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock and Allocation_. At the First Effective
Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or holders of any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub 1, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time (other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section
2.1(c)_ and other than any Dissenting Shares (collectively, " _Excluded
Shares_ ")) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash
and shares of Parent Stock based on Elections made by the holders of Company
Shares (but subject to _Section 2.1(f)_, _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6_)
as follows:

(i) Each such Company Share that is a Cash Election Share shall be converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount (such amount, the " _Per Share
Cash Consideration_ ") equal to the sum of (A) $32.00 (such amount, the "
_Average Cash Per Share_ ") and (B) the product of (x) 0.5 (such number of
shares, the " _Average Parent Stock Per Share_ ") multiplied by (y) the VWAP
of Parent Stock. The Per Share Cash Consideration shall be subject
to proration as set forth in Section 2.1 _(a)(iv)_.

(ii) Each such Company Share that is a Stock Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of Parent Shares (such number,
the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ") equal to the sum of (A) the Average
Parent Stock Per Share and (B) the quotient of (x) the Average Cash Per
Share divided by (y) the VWAP of Parent Stock. The Per Share Stock
Consideration shall be subject to proration as set forth in _Section
2.1(a)(v)_.

 

(iii) Each such Company Share that is an Undesignated Share or a Mixed
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the combination
(such combination, the " _Per Share Mixed Consideration_ ") of (A) the Average
Cash Per Share and (B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the Average Parent
Stock Per Share.

 

(iv) In the event that the number of Cash Election Shares exceeds the Cash
Election Number, then:

 

(A) each Stock Election Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and

(B) each Cash Election Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive both (x) an amount in cash equal to the quotient of
the Available Cash for Cash Election divided by the aggregate number of Cash
Election Shares (such amount, the " _Satisfied Per Share Cash Consideration_
") and (y) a number of Parent Shares equal to (i) the Per Share Cash
Consideration minus the Satisfied Per Share Cash Consideration divided by (ii)
the VWAP of Parent Stock.

 



-4- (v) In the event that the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds
the Stock Election Number, then:

(A) each Cash Election Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

(B) each Stock Election Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive (x) the number of Parent Shares equal to the
quotient of the Available Stock for Stock Election divided by the aggregate
number of Stock Election Shares (the " _Satisfied Per Share Stock
Consideration_ ") and (y) an amount in cash equal to (i) the Per Share Cash
Consideration minus (ii) the product of the VWAP of Parent Stock and the
Satisfied Per Share Stock Consideration.

 

(vi) The Exchange Agent shall make all computations, in consultation with
Parent and the Company, as to the allocation and the proration contemplated
by this _Section 2.1(a)_, and any such computation shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company stockholders. Parent and the Company may agree to make
such rules as are consistent with this Agreement for implementation of the
provisions of this _Section 2.1(a)_ as shall be necessary or desirable to
fully effect such provisions.

From and after the First Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the Per
Share Stock Consideration, Per Share Cash Consideration or Per Share Mixed
Consideration (subject to the proration and adjustment of the Per Share Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 _(a)(iv)_ and the Per Share Stock
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(v)_) and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Stock, if any, pursuant to _Section 2.6_ (the " _Fractional
Share Consideration_ "), into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_, together with the amounts, if any, payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ (such amounts, the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ").

(b) _Election Procedure_.

 

(i) _Election Forms and Types of Elections_. An election form in such form and
substance as designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Election Form_ ") shall be delivered by the Company with the Joint
Proxy Statement to each holder of record of Company Shares as of the Company
Record Date and to each holder of a vested Company RSU. Parent shall make
available one or more Election Forms as may be reasonably requested by any
Person who becomes a holder of record of Company Shares or holder of a vested
Company RSU after the Company Record Date and prior to the Election
Deadline. Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_, each
Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect (an "
_Election_ ") to receive (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration (a " _Stock
Election_ ") with respect to all of such holders Company Shares, (B) the Per
Share Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") with respect to all of such
holders Company Shares, or (C) the Per Share Mixed Consideration (a " _Mixed
Election_ ") with respect to all of such holders

 



-5-  Company Shares. Any Company Shares (other than Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_) with respect to which the
holder (or indirectly the beneficial owner) shall not have submitted to the
Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline shall be deemed to be " _Undesignated Shares_ " under this
Agreement.

 

(ii) _Proper and Timely Election_. Any Election shall have been properly made
and effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time on the fourth
business day after the Condition Satisfaction Date (or such other time and
date as the Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_
"); _provided_ , that (A) at least three business days prior to the Election
Deadline, Parent shall publish a press release announcing the Election
Deadline and (B) promptly following the close of trading on NASDAQ on the
business day immediately preceding the day of the Election Deadline, Parent
shall publish a press release announcing the VWAP of Parent Stock. An Election
Form shall be deemed properly completed only if an Election is indicated for
each Company Share covered by such Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form by delivery of
a revocation or new Election Form that is actually received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is timely
revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the Company Shares represented by such
Election Form shall automatically become Undesignated Shares unless and until
a new Election is properly made with respect to such Company Shares on or
before the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, Parent shall have discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms. Any decisions of Parent required by
the Exchange Agent made in good faith in determining such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, all
Company Shares owned by any Company Subsidiary, Parent, the Merger Subs or
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) _Treatment of Merger Sub 1 Capital Stock_. At the First Effective Time,
each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub 1 shall be
automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. 

(e) _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or
holders of any securities of the First Surviving Corporation or of Merger Sub
2,

(i) Each share of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
therefor; and

 

(ii) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation.

 



-6- (f) _Adjustment_. Any number or amount herein that is based upon the price of
the Parent Stock or the number or fraction of shares of Company Common Stock
or Parent Stock, as the case may be, and the Average Cash Per Share and/or
Average Parent Stock Per Share, as applicable, shall be adjusted appropriately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock or Parent Stock, as applicable), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the First
Effective Time.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub 1
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the exchange agent in connection with the First Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the
holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose of receiving and holding
their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented thereby. At or promptly after the First
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub 1 shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Per
Share Stock Consideration, and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of Per Share Cash
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section
2.2(f)_ to be paid in connection with the First Merger (such evidence of book-
entry shares of Parent Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each
case, for the sole benefit of the former holders of Company Shares. In the
event that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate
amount of all Per Share Cash Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and
any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub
1 to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount
which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall
make, delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then

 



-7-  publicly available), and (2) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation (at
the election of Parent) on the earlier of (A) one year after the First
Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the First Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Ultimate Surviving Corporation to, cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated
Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose
Company Shares each were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares
have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable
in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with  _Section
2.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to
be delivered within ten business days following the later to occur of (x) the
First Effective Time or (y) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
First Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_, without
interest thereon.

 



-8- (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the First Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect
to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the First Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust; No Liability_. At any
time following 12 months after the First Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund and
the Exchange Trust that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement
is pending subject only to the Exchange Agents routine administrative
procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Ultimate Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Subs, or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Per Share Merger Consideration, dividends, or other amounts properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof (such affidavit
to be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent), the
Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_, and any dividends or
other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section
2.2(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Parent Entities or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date after the
First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Stock
issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each

 



-9-  case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the First Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such shares of Parent Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
First Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Stock.

 

Section 2.3 _Dissenter s Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held
by holders of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and are entitled to demand, and have
properly demanded, appraisal of such Company Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section
2.1_, but instead at the First Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in
accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood and acknowledged
that at the First Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the
right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent
afforded by the Appraisal Rights); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall automatically converted
into and shall represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. " _Proposed Dissenting Shares_ " means Company Shares whose
holder provides a demand for appraisal to the Company prior to the Company
Special Meeting and does not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement,
in each case in accordance with the Appraisal Rights.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received
prior to the First Effective Time by the Company for appraisal of any Company
Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Appraisal Rights,
and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parents expense, to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. 

(a) As of the First Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit
representing a right to receive Company Common Stock, including any
restricted stock unit that

 



-10-  vests subject to the achievement of Company performance goals under any
Company Equity Plan (the " _Company RSUs_ ") that is not then vested and is
held by an individual who will continue in the service of Parent or the
Ultimate Surviving Corporation at the First Effective Time (a " _Continuing
Service Provider_ ") shall be substituted by Parent into a Parent RSU in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_. Each substituted Parent RSU shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting and economically
equivalent terms (including rights to dividend equivalents in cash) and
conditions as applied to the applicable Company RSUs immediately prior to the
First Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including
any necessary changes to any issuance provisions, provided for or permitted in
the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award agreement or in such
Company RSUs, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the
First Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Stock underlying each
such Parent RSU as so substituted shall be equal to the product of (i) the
number of Company Shares underlying the applicable Company RSUs multiplied by
(ii) the Per Share Stock Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole
number. To the extent a Company RSU was exempt from or compliant with Section
409A of the Code immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the
substitution of each Company RSU shall occur in a manner so as to remain
exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code, and this _Section
2.4_ shall be construed consistent with such intent. Each payment with
respect to a Parent RSU as to which payments will be made in installments is
and will be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(b) Any share of Company Common Stock underlying a Company RSU that is vested
as of the First Effective Time (taking into account any acceleration of
vesting that occurs by the First Effective Time under the applicable award
agreement or other Contract with the award holder), but as to which such
underlying share of Company Common Stock has not been issued by the First
Effective Time, will be issued as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time and will be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock for purposes of
_Section 2.1_ and shall receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided in  _Section 2.1_ based on an Election Form submitted by the
holder thereof, subject to applicable tax withholding. Any shares of Company
Common Stock underlying any Company RSU that has failed to vest as of the
First Effective Time and that is held by an individual who is not a
Continuing Service Provider shall be cancelled at the First Effective Time
without payment of any consideration.

 

(c) As of the First Effective Time, each outstanding stock option award
representing a right to purchase Company Common Stock that was
granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan and that is outstanding and
exercisable as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount of cash (without interest) equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of the Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) (A) the Per
Share Cash Consideration, less (B) the exercise price per share attributable
to the Company Stock Option. As soon as practicable (and in no event more than
30 calendar days) following the First Effective Time, the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a
Company Stock Option the consideration (if any) required to be paid to any
such holder pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_, subject to Section 2.5.

 



-11- (d) Not later than 15 days prior to the First Effective Time, the Company
shall send a notice to all holders of Company Stock Options, which notice
shall notify such holders that (i) Parent, the First Surviving Corporation and
the Ultimate Surviving Corporation will not be assuming any Company Stock
Options at or following the First Effective Time or substituting new options
therefor, (ii) all unvested Company Stock Options shall become vested and
fully exercisable as of and effective immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, and (iii) all Company Stock Options that are not exercised prior to the
First Effective Time will be cancelled and paid the consideration in the
manner set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_.

 

(e) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions and
take such other steps as are reasonably necessary for the treatment of the
Company RSUs and Company Stock Options as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_.

(f) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event more
than 10 business days following the Closing Date, Parent will file an
appropriate Registration Statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form with
respect to the offering of the Parent Shares issuable upon vesting of the
Parent RSUs (the " _S-8 Registration Statement_ ") and will use reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the S-8 Registration Statement
thereafter for so long as any of such Parent RSUs remain outstanding.

(g) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to (i) terminate the Amended and Restated 1997 KLA-
Tencor Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (ii) provide that any "
_Offering Period_ " (as defined in the Company ESPP) that would otherwise be
in progress on the Closing Date will be shortened in accordance with Section
18 of the Company ESPP, and the last day of each such Offering Period shall be
at least 10 business days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Final Purchase
Date_ "), with purchases made on the Final Purchase Date contingent upon the
occurrence of the First Effective Time, and (iii) avoid the commencement of
any new Offering Period under the Company ESPP at or after the Final Purchase
Date and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
First Effective Time. Any Company Shares acquired under the Company ESPP prior
to or on the Final Purchase Date will be treated as outstanding Company
Shares for purposes of _Section 2.1_ (including with respect to the
Election).

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. The Parent Entities, the First Surviving
Corporation and the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall each be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts that are required to be withheld or
deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

 



-12- Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Stock shall be issued upon the surrender or transfer for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent will
relate to such fractional shares of Parent Stock, and such fractional shares
of Parent Stock will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of
a stockholder of Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Shares converted pursuant to the First Merger who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Stock (after taking into
account all Company Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, from the Exchange Agent, at Parents election,
either (i) a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Stock
representing that holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of the aggregate of
the fractional shares of Parent Stock which would otherwise have been issued
under this _Article II_ (the " _Excess Shares of Stock_ ") or (ii) cash in
accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_ below. The sale of the Excess Shares of
Stock shall be (i) executed on NASDAQ and (ii) made at such times, in such
manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its
reasonable discretion. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with this _Section 2.6_, the Exchange Agent shall hold the net proceeds in
trust (the " _Exchange Trust_ ") for those holders. All commissions, fees,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with
the sale of the Excess Shares of Stock shall be paid by Parent and the
Ultimate Surviving Corporation. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Certificates and
Book Entry Shares in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall make that amount available to those holders, without interest.
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the net proceeds to which
each holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled by
multiplying the aggregate amount of the net proceeds by a fraction of which
(X) the numerator is the amount of the fractional shares of Parent Stock to
which such holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares is entitled (after
taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) and (Y) the denominator is the aggregate amount of fractional shares
of Parent Stock to which all holders of Certificates and Book Entry Shares are
entitled.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.6(b)_, Parent may elect, at
its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay to the Exchange
Agent an amount in cash in United States dollars, to be deposited promptly
following the Effective Time, sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each
holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Parent
Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled by (ii) the
closing price for a share of Parent Stock on NASDAQ on the first business day
immediately following the First Effective Time. In such event, all references
in this Agreement to the net proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares of
Stock and similar references shall be deemed to refer to the payments
calculated in the manner set forth in this _Section 2.6(c)_.

 



-13- Section 2.7 _Further Assurances_. At and after the First Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
the Merger Subs, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or the Merger Subs, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Ultimate Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in,
to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Ultimate Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Mergers.

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Reports filed on or after June 30,
2015 and prior to the date of this Agreement (including exhibits and other
information incorporated by reference therein, but excluding any amendment
thereto made after the date of this Agreement or any forward looking
disclosures set forth in any "risk factors" section, any disclosures in any
"forward looking statements" section and any other disclosures included
therein to the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in nature);
_provided_ that the exclusion of this clause (i) shall not apply to the
representations set forth in _Section 3.3_ or (ii) with respect to each
section and subsection within this _Article III_, the corresponding section
or subsection of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company

disclosure with respect to any other Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and the Merger Subs as set forth below.

 

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete

proceeding therefor may be brought), (ii) Parent or the Parent Subsidiary, as
applicable, is not in default under any Parent Material Contract, has not
committed or failed to perform any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the Parent Material Contract,

(i) to the knowledge of Parent, Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have
obtained all export licenses and other approvals required for their exports
of products, software and technologies from the U.S., except as would not
result in a liability that is material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,

(ii) to the knowledge of Parent, Parent and each Parent Subsidiary are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of such applicable export
licenses or other approvals.

Section 4.18 _Affiliate Transactions_. Other than compensation payable

of 5% or more of the outstanding Parent Stock, on the other hand.

Section 4.19 _Vote Required_. The Parent Stockholder Approval is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of Parents capital stock necessary
to authorize the issuance of Parent Shares in the First Merger as contemplated

Section 4.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Parent Board of Directors received an opinion from Goldman,
Sachs and Co. (the " _Parent Financial Advisor_ ") to the effect that, as of the
date hereof and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and
assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid
by Parent pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
Parent. Parent will make available to the Company a copy of the written
opinion promptly following the execution of this Agreement for informational
purposes only.

 

Section 4.21 _Merger Subs_. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the consummation of this
Agreement and the Transactions, neither Merger Sub has incurred any
obligations or liabilities, has engaged in any business or activities of any
type or kind whatsoever or has entered into any Contracts or arrangements
with any person or entity.

Section 4.22 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Subs
or any entity controlled, directly or indirectly through any person or
persons, by Parent (other than any Parent Plans) beneficially owns any Company
Shares.

 

Section 4.23 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the
executed Bridge Commitment Letter from Goldman Sachs Bank U.S.A. and any
related fee letters (redacted as to economic terms only, including fee
amounts, _provided_ that no redaction covers terms governing the aggregate
amount, conditionality, availability, or termination of the debt financing
contemplated therein). The Bridge Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement, and no such
amendment or modification of the Bridge Commitment Letter is contemplated as
of the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has
entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to the
financing of the Transactions, other than as set forth in the Bridge
Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto that could adversely
affect the availability, aggregate amount, conditionality or termination of
the Financing on the Closing Date. The commitments contained in the Bridge
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The
Bridge Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
each other party thereto, to provide the financing contemplated thereby
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and,
subject to the qualifications that: (i) such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
other similar laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors and (ii) that

 



-48-  equitable remedies, including specific performance and injunctive relief,
are discretionary and subject to equitable defenses, and may not be ordered.
Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and
other amounts that are due and payable prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would reasonably constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Bridge
Commitment Letter. Parent has no reason to believe that it or any other
party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the
Bridge Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions and as expressly set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter and any
related fee letters. Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the
Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on the Closing Date or (ii) the
Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date.

(b) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Bridge Commitment
Letter and the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder, in each case, solely to the extent the breach of such
representation, warranty or obligation would materially affect the
satisfaction by Parent of the Financing Conditions, Parent has, or will have
at Closing, all funds necessary to consummate the Transactions, including the
making of all required payments in connection with the Transactions
(including payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration and Fractional Share
Consideration and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and
associated costs and expenses of the Transactions required on or prior to the
Closing Date). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by Parent
or any of its affiliates be a condition to any of Parent or the Merger Subs
obligations hereunder. The Company agrees that a breach of this
representation and warranty shall not result in the failure of a condition
precedent to Companys obligations under this Agreement, if (notwithstanding
such breach) Parent is willing and able to consummate the Transactions on the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms hereof.

Proposal, then in either event the Company and its Representatives may take
the following actions after the Company gives notice to Parent of its intent

Competing Proposal or any material amendment thereto, any inquiries that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal, or any initial
inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected
to make any Company Competing Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and
confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the

any oral terms) material to understanding a Company Competing Proposal which
is received by the Company from any Person relating to such Company Competing
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
discussions relating to, and material terms (including any amendments or

contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening Event if, and only if,
(i) the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to make
a Company Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of
Directors under applicable Law ( _provided_ , that the actions of the Company
Board of Directors in making such determination and such determination shall
not themselves constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or a violation of
_Section 5.5(c)_), (ii) the Company has provided Parent with a written notice
of such 

 



-57-  determination and that the Company Board of Directors intends to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to the
applicable Company Intervening Event) ( _provided_ that the giving of such
notice and actions of the Company Board of Directors in authorizing and
disclosing (to the extent legally required) such notice shall not themselves
constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or a violation of _Section
5.5(c)_) and (iii) during the four business day period commencing, if Parents
receipt of such notice is prior to 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on the date of
Parents receipt of such notice, or, if such receipt is after 3:00 p.m.
Pacific Time, on the business day first following the date of Parents receipt
of such notice, the Company has made its Representatives reasonably
available for the purpose of engaging in discussions and negotiations with

regarding a possible amendment to this Agreement and has considered in good
faith any proposals made by Parent, and after taking account of Parents
proposals, if any, the Company Board of Directors again makes the
determination set forth in _Section 5.3(e)(i)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3_ or _Section 5.5_ to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may in response to its receipt of a
_bona fide_ written Company Competing Proposal make a Company Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to, substantially concurrently
with such termination, enter into a definitive written agreement providing for
such Company Competing Proposal pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ if, and only if,
(i) the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor
that (x) such Company Competing Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, and (y) the failure to make such Company Change of Recommendation
or to terminate this Agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors
under applicable Law ( _provided_ , that the actions of the Company Board of
Directors in making such determination and such determination shall not
themselves constitute a Company Change of Recommendation, a violation of
_Section 5.5(c)_ or a termination of this Agreement), (ii) the Company has
provided Parent with a written notice of such determination and that the
Company Board of Directors intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation or that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement,
together with a copy of the proposed form of each material agreement to be
entered into in connection with such Company Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Company Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that
the giving of such notice and actions of the Company Board of Directors in
authorizing and disclosing (to the extent legally required) such notice shall
not themselves constitute a Company Change of Recommendation, a violation of
_Section 5.5(c)_ or a termination of this Agreement) and (iii) during the
four business day period commencing, if Parents receipt of such notice is
prior to 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on the date of Parents receipt of such
notice, or, if such receipt is after 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on the business

Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members
of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law; _provided_ that any
such disclosure referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to a Company
Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Change of Recommendation
unless (x) the Company Board of Directors expressly reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such disclosure or (y) such disclosure is a "stop,
look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _further_ that

Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of
the Company and the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 5.5(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 5.5(a)_. For
purposes of this _Section 5.5_, any information concerning or related to the
Company, its affiliates or the Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have
been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to

Company Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a

to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Special Meeting may not be
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for
which the Company Special Meeting was originally scheduled (other than any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law, including
adjournments or postponements to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable

Statement is provided or made available to the stockholders of the Company or
to permit dissemination of information that is material to stockholders voting
at the Company Special Meeting and to give the stockholders of the Company
sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or other

Parent Change of Recommendation as permitted by  _Section 5.4_.

date for which the Parent Special Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Stock
to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,
Parent shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Special Meeting; _provided_ that the
Parent Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more
than 30 days after the date for which the Parent Special Meeting was

reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided or made available to the
stockholders of Parent or to permit dissemination of information which is
material to stockholders voting at the Parent Special Meeting and to give the
stockholders of Parent sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or
amendment or other information). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the issuance of the
Parent Stock in the First Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the
approval thereof.

 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on the
same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the First Effective Time or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section

Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to afford to the other Party and to
the Representatives of such other Party reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively,
to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other Party all information (financial
or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
Party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required by this _Section 6.1_ to provide the
other Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to
disclose information (i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii)
the disclosure of which would violate any Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in
violation of any Law) or (iii) that is subject to any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such access and information shall be disclosed
or granted, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent to the extent
reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust
Laws subject to prior execution of a common interest or joint defense
agreement in customary form. Each of the Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to permit the
inclusion of all Financing Sources (including convertible or equity-linked
debt) (and representatives of such Financing Sources) in the term
"Representative" as such term is defined therein.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party

 



-66-  from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent
could be material to the Company, the Ultimate Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (ii) of any legal proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge,
threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise
relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to
the Transactions, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or
impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, or that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impede the consummation of the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or
give rise to any right to terminate under  _Article VIII_.

(d) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent (i) a complete and correct copy of the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended to the date of delivery, of each Company Subsidiary
that is a not "significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of
Regulation S-X of the SEC) and (ii) a complete and correct copy of each of the
Company Plans that are listed in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter but which were not made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement.

Severance Plan, using reasonable best efforts to deliver such report within
30 days after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to each
current or former Worker who is reasonably likely to be a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.280G-1), within a reasonable period prior to the Closing Date.

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable after
the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the
other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date
hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and

-67-  necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority in
order to consummate the Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations,
consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals, including defending or contesting any
claim, suit, action or other proceeding brought by a Third Party, including
any Governmental Authorities, that would otherwise prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to
make all necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings required (and
thereafter make any other required submissions and respond as promptly as
practicable to any requests for additional information or documentary
material) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (A) with the DOJ
and the FTC on a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions, (B) with the German Federal Cartel Office (
_Bundeskartellamt_ ), (C) in China, and (D) in the jurisdictions set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Specified Antitrust Authorities_ "). The Parties agree to
make the filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 30 days after the execution of this Agreement (unless another date is
mutually agreed between the Parties), and make the filings contemplated by
clauses (B), (C) and (D) of the preceding sentence as promptly as practicable,
and will endeavor to make such filings within 60 days after the execution of
this Agreement (unless another date is mutually agreed between the Parties).
The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Authority, by promptly providing
copies to the other Party of any such written communications, and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions;  _provided_
, _however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit the
other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone
call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Authority, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person ( _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to
remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to

 



-68-  comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns), and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the
FTC or any other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person
meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or other
Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary will be required to (i) divest, dispose of or
hold separate any assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) agree to divest, dispose or hold separate
any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or (iii) agree to or enter into any license or condition or
commit to take any action that limits in any manner its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets or businesses of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the extent
such license, condition or action is not commercially reasonable or materially
impacts in an adverse manner the benefits to be derived by Parent from the
Transactions. The Company (x) will not, in connection with obtaining
regulatory approval of the Transactions, take or agree to take any action
identified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence
without the prior written consent of Parent and (y) if so requested by Parent,
will use reasonable best efforts to effect any license, divestiture,
disposition or hold separate of any of the Companys assets or businesses
necessary to obtain clearances or approvals required for the Closing under the
Antitrust Laws, _provided_ that such action is conditioned on the consummation
of the Mergers. The Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, regarding the form and
content of any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either
Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law
prior to their submission.

(c) Except as set forth in  _Section 6.2(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain all consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third
parties (other than Governmental Authorities, which are the subject of
clauses (a) and (b) above) necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation
of the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties required to be
provided by them prior to the First Effective Time;  _provided_ that, without
consulting with Parent, the Company shall not incur any significant expense or
liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement or agree to
any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain such
consents or certificates.

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company have agreed upon the initial
joint press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement, and will
issue such press release promptly following the execution of this Agreement.
Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor
Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Transactions or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it
is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to the Transactions or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable

 



-69-  under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other
Party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement in
advance and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.3_ to provide any such
review or comment to Parent in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Company Competing Proposal or a Company Change of Recommendation and matters
related thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not be required by
this _Section 6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to the Company in
connection with the receipt and existence of a Parent Competing Proposal or a
Parent Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3_, (i) Parent and the Company
may make press releases or public announcements concerning this Agreement or
the Transactions that consist solely of information previously disclosed in
all material respects in previous press releases or announcements made by
Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.3_, and (ii)
Parent and the Company may make public statements in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in all material
respects in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the Company and Parent and do not reveal material, non-public
information regarding the other Parties, this Agreement or the Transactions.

Section 6.4  _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For
not less than six years from and after the First Effective Time, the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent agrees to cause the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law; provided such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, in
connection with such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or
other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any
Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or
provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights
to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
First Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For six

 



-70-  years after the Effective Time, the Ultimate Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing
Documents and (ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Transactions). Parent shall
cause the Ultimate Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period
of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the First Effective Time (the
" _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing
policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the
best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company may prior
to the First Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage
with respect to DandO Insurance (which may include provision of Side B coverage)
with an aggregate cost not to exceed $2,500,000, and Parent shall cause any
such tail policy coverage to be maintained in full force and effect for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the
final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Ultimate
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.4_. The rights and obligations under this _Section 6.4_
shall survive consummation of the Mergers and shall not be terminated or
amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the
written consent of such Indemnified Party.

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and
the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize
the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other
Transactions.

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Subs_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause each of the Merger Subs, the First Surviving Corporation
and the Ultimate Surviving

 



-71-  Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Transactions, including the Mergers, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) As a result of the Mergers, at the Second Effective Time, each of the
then-current employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
become employees of the Ultimate Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") by operation of Law.

 

(b) _Base Salary_. Effective as of the Second Effective Time and until the
earlier of (i) December 31, 2016 and (ii) the termination of the Continuing
Employees service (the " _Protection Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Ultimate Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates or
successors (collectively, the " _Parent Employers_ "), to maintain each
Continuing Employees base salary or base hourly wage, as applicable, as in
effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time.

 

(c) _Short Term Target Bonus Opportunity_.

 

(i) During the Protection Period, Parent shall cause the Parent Employers to
assume, honor and fulfill the Companys obligations to each Continuing
Employee under those Company Plans that (x) are short term cash incentive

which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the First
Effective Time with respect to the performance period that is ongoing as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time under such Company Plan.

 

(ii) If the First Effective Time occurs prior to the end of the Companys 2016
fiscal year, and Parent expects to have a Continuing Employee participate in
short term cash incentive plan of the Parent Employers commencing January 1,
2017 (i.e., the beginning of Parents compensation year), then Parent shall
cause the Parent Employers to adopt a short term cash incentive arrangement
for such Continuing Employee for the period beginning on the first day of what
would have otherwise been the start of the Companys 2017 fiscal year through
December 31, 2016.

 

(d) _Health, Welfare and 401(k) Benefits_. During the Protection Period,
Parent shall cause the Parent Employers to permit each Continuing Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) to participate (i) in those Company Plans
that (x) are health, welfare and Code Section 401(k) plans listed on Section
3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (y) were in effect at the First
Effective Time or (ii) in the same type of health, welfare or Code Section
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by the Parent Employers for the benefit of
similarly situated employees of the Parent Employers, on the same terms and
conditions as apply to such Parent Employer employees, in each case of (i) and
(ii), other than with respect to retiree health and welfare plans and defined
benefit plans.

 

(e) _Service Credit_. Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Parent Employers to recognize and take into account
with respect to each

 



-72-  Continuing Employee his or her period of employment with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including any current or former affiliate of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or any predecessor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits, and
vesting of benefits, under the employee benefit plans maintained by the Parent
Employers for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or
other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, Code Section 401(k) plans or other
defined contribution retirement plans, severance practices, and health and
welfare plans, except that the Parent Employers shall not be required to
recognize and take into account such service (i) for purposes of determining
any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree health
or welfare plan, (ii) for purposes of vesting credit for any awards granted
under any long term incentive programs after the First Effective Time, (iii)
to the extent the Company did not recognize such period of employment under a
plan or program of a similar type maintained, sponsored by or contributed to
by the Company prior to the First Effective Time, or (iv) if such recognition
of service would result in a duplication of benefits.

(f)  _Waiver of Limitations_. During the Protection Period, Parent shall
cause the Parent Employers to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to
the Continuing Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan
of the Parent Employers made available to the Continuing Employees during the
Protection Period (except to the extent such periods, requirements,
limitations or exclusions were applicable under the Company Plans immediately
prior to the First Effective Time), and (ii) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements under the health and welfare benefit plans of the
Parent Employers made available to the Continuing Employees with respect to
such Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability
requirements were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under
the Company Plans of a similar type immediately prior to the First Effective
Time.

(g) _Severance_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation to, assume, honor and fulfill the terms of the Companys Executive
Severance Plan and 2010 Executive Severance Plan. The Company shall have taken
all actions necessary to ensure that each and every severance benefit plan or
practice governed by ERISA and covering any Continuing Employee prior to the
First Effective Time will be terminated as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and no Parent Employer will have any liability in respect of
any such ERISA severance plan or practice from and after the First Effective
Time with respect to any Continuing Employee. From the First Effective Time
through the first anniversary of the First Effective Time, the Parent
Employers shall ensure that each Continuing Employee is covered by the
severance plans and practices of the Parent Employers that are applicable to
similarly situated Parent Employer employees, except to the extent that the
Company did not provide severance plans or practices to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time or if such coverage
would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(h) _Vacation_. At the First Effective Time, the Parent Employers will
recognize and honor each Continuing Employees accrued but unused vacation or

(i) _No Third Party Rights_. This _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this _Section 6.7_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this  _Section 6.7_. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated
as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (ii) give any third party any
right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ or (iii)
require Parent or any Parent Employer to maintain any particular Company Plan
or other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or any other employee or
service provider of the Company or any of its affiliates any right to
continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Ultimate Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Ultimate Surviving Corporation or any
affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee or any other service
provider, at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

 



-73- Section 6.8 _Termination of Company Plans_. If requested by Parent at least 10
days prior to the Closing, then effective as of no later than the day

Effective Time, adopt a resolution providing in substance that the
dispositions by the Company Insiders of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) in exchange for
shares of Parent Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b)
under the Exchange Act in accordance with Rule 16b-3 and interpretations of
the SEC thereunder. Thereafter and, assuming that the Company delivers to
Parent the Company Section 16 Information in a timely fashion prior to the
First Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in
any event prior to the First Effective Time adopt a resolution providing in
substance that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Stock in
exchange for Company Common Stock and derivative securities with respect to

Party prompt oral notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of that
Party against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective directors relating to the Mergers, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, and will provide the other Party with updates and such
information as such other Party will reasonably request with respect to the
status of the litigation and discussions between the parties to such
litigation (unless the provision of such updates and information could
reasonably be expected to result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). The
Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of and
settlement discussions with respect to any such litigation and will not make
any payment or settlement offer prior to the First Effective Time with
respect to any such litigation unless Parent will have

 



-74-  consented in writing to such payment or settlement, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, except that Parent shall not be obligated to consent
to any settlement which does not include a full release of Parent and its
affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the
First Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates. In the event of,
and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ and _Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2_ or _Section 6.2_, the
provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall control.

 

Section 6.11 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall

Section 6.12 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable

director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and effective upon the First Effective Time.

 

Section 6.13 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Mergers, taken together, to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the Parties shall (and each of the Parties
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to
take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the
Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties intend to report and,
except to the extent otherwise required by Law, shall report, for all tax
purposes, the Mergers, taken together, as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions described in _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.3(e)_,
respectively (collectively, the " _Tax Opinions_ "). The appropriate officers
of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company shall execute and deliver to Jones
Day, counsel to Parent, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, counsel to the Company, certificates substantially in the forms
set forth in Section 6.13 of the Parent Disclosure Letter and Section 6.13 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, respectively (the " _Representation Letters_
"). Each Representation Letter shall be dated on or before the date of such
Tax Opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material
respect.

Section 6.14 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the First
Merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of

Section 6.15 _The Company s Financing Cooperation_. The Company agrees to,
and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such
assistance (and to use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective personnel and advisors to provide such assistance) with the
Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent, including using reasonable
best efforts with respect to: (a) participation in, and assistance with, the
marketing efforts related

 



-75-  to the Financing, including participation, including by senior management of
the Company, in, and assistance with, the preparation of presentations,
meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and meetings (including one-on-one meetings or conference calls with
parties acting as agents or arrangers for, and prospective lenders of and
investors in, the Financing); (b) delivery to Parent and its Financing
Sources as promptly as reasonably practicable of the Financing Deliverables,

to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for the
Financing, including (i) offering documents and memoranda, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, confidential information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents for any portion of such Financing and (ii)
materials for rating agency presentations; (c) cause its independent auditors,
accountants and external and internal counsel (including local counsel) to
cooperate with the Financing consistent with customary practices, including by
providing customary review of interim financial statements as provided in
Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, "comfort letters" (including
customary "negative assurances"), opinions of counsel (which shall be limited
to opinions concerning the Company of a type customarily delivered by counsel
to target companies and shall not include opinions regarding enforceability
or similar matters) and customary assistance with the due diligence activities
of Parent and the Financing Sources, and customary consents to the inclusion
of audit reports in any relevant marketing materials, registration statements
and related government filings; (d) ensuring that the Financing benefits from
the existing lending relationships of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; and (e) causing to be timely filed with the SEC all required
periodic and other reports. For purposes of clarity, such assistance shall
include (A) if requested by Parent, using reasonable best efforts to assist
Parent in obtaining prior to Closing payoff letters from the Companys
lenders in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent with respect
thereto and (B) making all requisite notices with respect to the Companys
outstanding Indebtedness regarding the change in control contemplated hereby.
The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between the Company and
Parent (or its affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and its affiliates
may share customary projections with respect to the Company and its business
with the Financing Sources identified in the Bridge Commitment Letter, and
that Parent, its affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such
information with potential Financing Sources in connection with any marketing
efforts in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that the recipients of
such information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors
or officers or other personnel shall be required by this _Section 6.15_ (i)
to take any action or provide any assistance that unreasonably interferes
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) to adopt
resolutions or give consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Financing or the Debt Financing Documents; or (iii) to execute or deliver any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the
Closing or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate,
document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing

 



-76-  (other than a payoff letter with respect to the Credit Agreement) with
respect to the Financing. Parent shall (1) promptly upon written request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing the
assistance contemplated by this _Section 6.15_ and (2) indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers, personnel and advisors from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the
Financing or any assistance or activities in connection therewith, except to
the extent arising from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or
intentional misrepresentation of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.16 _Parent s Financing Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take,
or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and do,
or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be done, all things necessary
to obtain the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter, including with respect
to: (i) maintaining in effect the Bridge Commitment Letter and complying with
its obligations thereunder; (ii) participation by senior management of Parent
in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and
meetings with rating agencies; (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions to the Financing (including the Financing Conditions) that are
within Parents control; (iv) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt
Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Bridge Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto); and (v)
drawing up to the full amount of the Financing and causing the Financing
Sources to fund the Financing in accordance with its terms on the Closing
Date in the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.2_ and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would
be satisfied, in each case to the extent the Financing is needed to
consummate the Transactions, it being understood that nothing herein shall
prevent Parent from substituting other financing for all or a portion of the
Financing in accordance with this _Section 6.16(a)_ upon terms and
conditions that would not have any of the effects specified in the penultimate
sentence of this _Section 6.16(a)_ (any such financing upon such terms and
conditions an " _Alternative Financing_ "). Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice of any material breach or threatened breach by any party to the
Bridge Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware. Without limiting
Parents other obligations under this _Section 6.16_, if a Financing Failure
Event occurs, Parent shall (i) immediately notify the Company of such
Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) in consultation with
the Company, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an
Alternative Financing on terms (including conditionality, structure,
covenants and pricing) not materially less beneficial in the aggregate to
Parent, with lenders reasonably satisfactory to Parent, in an amount, when
added with cash and marketable securities of Merger Subs and Parent,
sufficient to consummate the Transactions, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, and (iii) obtain, and when obtained,
provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment letter that
provides for such Alternative Financing. Parent shall not, without the
Companys prior written consent, agree to any amendment or modification to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Bridge Commitment Letter or
any Debt Financing Document unless, in each case, the terms and conditions
thereof, as so amended, modified or waived, are in the aggregate at least as
favorable

 



-77-  to the Company and Parent as those contained therein prior to giving effect
to such amendment, modification or waiver; _provided_ that, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the following amendments, modifications and
waivers shall be understood to result in terms and conditions that are in the
aggregate less favorable to the Company and Parent: (i) any amendment,
modification or waiver that could reasonably be expected to (x) materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or the Merger Subs to timely consummate
the Transactions or (y) make the timely funding of the Financing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less
likely to occur, (ii) any amendment, modification or waiver of the conditions
to obtaining the Financing, unless such amendment, modification or waiver
results in conditions that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent
(or that are more favorable to the Company and Parent) to such conditions to
obtaining the Financing immediately prior to such amendment, modification or
waiver, (iii) any amendment, modification or waiver that reduces the amount of
the Financing or (iv) any amendment, modification or waiver that materially
and adversely affects the ability of Parent or its affiliates to enforce their
rights against the other parties to the Bridge Commitment Letter or such Debt
Financing Documents;  _provided_ , that Parent shall have the right to
substitute Alternative Financing for all or any portion of the Financing
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 6.16(b)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Merger Subs may replace or
amend the Bridge Commitment Letter solely to (i) add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Bridge Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, (ii) to reassign titles to
such parties who have not executed the Bridge Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, or (iii) to waive any closing conditions by any lenders or their
agents. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
its efforts to obtain the Financing.

(b) Parent shall have the right to substitute Alternative Financing for all or
any portion of the Financing and to reduce the aggregate commitments under
the Bridge Commitment Letter by an amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of the Alternative Financing so substituted; _provided_ , that to the
extent any such Indebtedness has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption
right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier of the consummation
of the Transactions on the Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or
the Outside Date (for purposes of clarity, as it may be extended pursuant to
this Agreement). Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute
commitments in respect of any Alternative Financing or other equity financing
for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative 
_bona fide_ third-party financing sources so long as (i) the terms thereof
would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the
timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing materially less likely to occur, (ii) the conditions to the
Financing set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter would not be expanded or
modified in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
Closing,  _provided still further_ , that any such substitute financing shall
not obligate the Company prior to the Closing as a surety, guarantor or
indemnitor or require the Company to extend credit to any Person, (iii) the
aggregate amount of funds made available to Parent is in an amount sufficient
to consummate the Transactions, including the making of all required payments
in connection with the Transactions (including payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration and Fractional Share Consideration and all other amounts to be
paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the
Transactions required on or prior to the Closing Date, and (iv) the terms of
any alternative financings do not materially and adversely affect the ability
of Parent to enforce

 



-78-  its rights against the other parties to the Bridge Commitment Letter with
respect to any remaining commitments (or Replacement Financing, (as defined
below)) or such Debt Financing Documents with respect to any remaining
commitments (or Replacement Financing Documents (as defined below)) (any such
Indebtedness or equity financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iv), the " _Replacement Financing_ "; the definitive documentation
for any such Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing Documents_
"). The representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of
Parent and the Merger Subs contained in this Agreement with respect to the
Financing and the Bridge Commitment Letter shall apply equally to any
Replacement Financing and Replacement Financing Documents. Parent acknowledges
and agrees that obtaining the financing contemplated by this  _Section
6.16_, or any other financing, is not a condition to the Closing, and affirms
its obligations to consummate the Transactions (subject to the conditions
contained in _Article VII_ of this Agreement) irrespective and independently
of the availability of any such financing.

Section 6.17 _Parent Board Representation_. Prior to the First Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint two members of the Company Board of Directors to
serve as members of the Parent Board of Directors effective as of immediately
after the First Effective Time to serve until the next annual meeting
of Parents stockholders in accordance with the Parent Governing Documents.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to identify such individuals (or any substitutes),
which individuals shall be subject to the recommendation of the Nominating
and Governance Committee of the Parent Board of Directors.

jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable Adverse Law or Order
permanently restraining, permanently enjoining or otherwise permanently

there has been a breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or any
Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
conditions in _Article VII_ not being satisfied (assuming that the date of
such determination is the Closing Date and that such breach is not curable
prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not
been cured within the earlier of (i) 45

 



-82-  calendar days after the receipt of notice thereof by the defaulting Party

consummated by the Outside Date;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if the First Effective Time shall not
have occurred by 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on July 20, 2016 (the " _Outside

Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." All references in this Agreement to "Sections,"
"Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement
and Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. References herein to a Person are also to such Persons successors
and permitted assigns. All references in this Agreement to "$" or other
monetary amounts refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided
for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. As used in
this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of contents and headings set forth in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not
affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision hereof. All references herein to the
Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the
context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented
by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by e-mail of a .pdf, .tif, .jpeg or similar attachment ("
_Electronic Delivery_ ") in two or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any such counterpart, to the
extent delivered using Electronic Delivery shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party shall raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such Party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_, Parent and
the Merger

 



-106-  Subs shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement)
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in _Section 6.4_ and the last sentence of _Section
6.15_, neither this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended
to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder; _provided_ that the Financing Sources shall be express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 9.9(b)_ and _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section
9.11(a)_, _Section 9.11(b)_, and _Section 9.15_, and each of such Sections
shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and the
Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of
such Sections.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Mergers is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Mergers are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of
itself and each Company Related Party) and each of the other Parties hereto
agrees that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether
based upon contract, tort or otherwise) against a Financing Source that is in
any way related to this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the
other Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles
(other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations
Law); _provided_ that (i) the interpretation of the definition of Company
Material Adverse Effect or "Target Material Adverse Effect" (as defined in
any commitment letter related to the Financing) and whether or not a Company
Material Adverse Effect or "Target Material Adverse Effect" (as defined in any
commitment letter related to the Financing) has occurred, (ii) the
determination of the accuracy of any "Acquisition Representations" (as
defined in any commitment letter related to the Financing) and whether as a
result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent, the Merger Subs or their respective
affiliates have the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement,
or to decline to consummate the Transactions pursuant to this Agreement and
(iii) the determination of whether the Transactions have been consummated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed
by, and construed and interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that
would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

 



-107- (b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and
only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate
court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such
courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process inside
or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this 
_Section 9.11(b)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and each
Company Related Party) and each of the other Parties hereto (A) agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (B)
submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (C) agrees that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its
address provided in _Section 9.4_ shall be effective service of process
against it for any such action brought in any such court, (D) waives and
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action
in any such court and (E) agrees that a final judgment in any such action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR

 



-108-  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE MERGERS, THE FINANCING AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST
ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 9.12_.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Merger Subs may assign, in their
sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent; _provided_ ,
that no such assignment shall relieve any Parent Entity of any obligation or
liability under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order
of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 9.14_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For purposes of clarity,
each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of
this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred
to in this _Section 9.14_, such Party shall not be required to obtain,
furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any such remedy.

 



-109- Section 9.15 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company (on behalf of itself and each Company
Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger Subs)) agrees that neither it
nor any other Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger Subs)
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any
Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Merger Subs) in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ that, following consummation of the Mergers, the foregoing will
not limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under the Debt Financing
Documents. In addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable for
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including
any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a
tortious nature.
