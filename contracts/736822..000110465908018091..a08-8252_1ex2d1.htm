place (a) at the offices of Sutherland Asbill and Brennan

  



        
   

  



  

LLP, 999 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, 10:00 a.m., local time

 **Section 1.3** ** Effect of the Merger.** At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

 **Section 1.4** ** Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.**
The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior

provided in such Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law, except that

Directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective

shares of capital stock of Matrix:

  



  

### (a) **_Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_**. _ _The capital stock

exchange for those Excluded Shares.

  

### 

  

### (c) **_Consideration; Conversion of Matrix Capital Stock_**. _ _The "
** _Aggregate Merger Consideration_** " shall consist of an amount equal to

solely for purposes of determining the Aggregate Merger Consideration in
connection with consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time (including
with respect to determining the Common Stock Share Valuation under _Section
1.6(c)(vii)_), and without limiting or otherwise impairing the effect of
_Article XI_ for any other purpose, the adjustments contemplated under
_Article XI_ shall not be taken into account.

  



        
   

  



  

#### (i) Each Matrix Shareholder that is not a Dissenting Stockholder shall
receive the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration allocated to such
Matrix Shareholder in accordance with _Sections 1.6(c)(ii)-(vii)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Each share of Series E Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest (the " **
_Series E Per Share Merger Consideration_**"), equal to $0.50, plus the
amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon as of the Effective Time
(the " ** _Series E Share Valuation_**").

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Each share of Series D Stock issued and outstanding immediately

amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon as of the Effective Time
(the " ** _Series D Share Valuation_**").

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Each share of Series C Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted

(the " ** _Series C Share Valuation_**").

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Each share of Series B Stock issued and outstanding immediately

Merger Consideration_**").

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) Each share of Series A Stock issued and outstanding immediately

Merger Consideration_**").

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) Each share of Matrix Common Stock, Series A Stock and Series B
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other

amount of cash, without interest (the " ** _Common Stock Per Share Merger

equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration minus the aggregate of all
amounts to be paid pursuant to _Sections 1.6(c)(ii)_ , _(iii) _and _(iv)_ ;
by (B) the total number of shares of Matrix Common Stock, Series A Stock and
Series B Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than Excluded Shares (the " ** _Common Stock Share Valuation_**
").

  

#### 

  

#### (viii) Any election by a holder of Series E Stock, Series D Stock,
Series C Stock, Series B or Series A Stock (collectively, the " **
_Convertible Preferred Stock_** ") to convert such holders Convertible
Preferred Stock into Matrix Common Stock must be communicated by such holder
to Matrix, if at all, prior to the Closing Date.

  



        
   

  



  

#### (ix) All issued and outstanding shares of Matrix Capital Stock that have
been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided in this _Section 1.6(c) _shall be canceled automatically and
shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented those shares (" ** _Matrix Certificates_**
") shall cease to have any rights with respect to those shares, other than
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Matrix Certificates in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_.

  

#### 

  

 **Section 1.7** ** Treatment of Matrix Options.** Matrix shall take all
necessary actions to cause each Matrix Option outstanding, whether or
not then exercisable or vested, either to be exercised or terminated and
cancelled prior to the Effective Time and without any Liability as of or
after the Effective Time to Matrix, Immucor or any of their Affiliates (other
than as provided in this _Section 1.7_), including obtaining all
necessary consents or approvals from holders of Matrix Options. Each holder
of a Matrix Option, whether vested or unvested, unexercised prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such Matrix
Option, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, a cash
payment (less applicable withholding taxes and without interest) from the
Surviving Corporation, in the case of employee stock options, and from the
Exchange Agent, in the case of other stock options and warrants **** (the "
** _Option Cash Payment_** " and the sum of all such payments, the " **
_Total Option Cash Payments_** "), equal to the product of (a) the excess, if
any, of the Assumed Option Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Matrix Option multiplied by (b) the number of shares
of Matrix Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Matrix Option. No
payment will be due with respect of any Matrix Option with an exercise price
equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration as so determined.
From and after the Effective Time, no holder of a Matrix Option shall have
any rights in respect thereof other than to receive the Option Cash Payment,
if any, due with respect thereto. Matrix will use reasonable best efforts to
cause each holder of a Matrix Option to execute and deliver to Immucor prior
to the Closing a waiver and release form relating to the termination and
cancellation of each Matrix Option, together with an agreement to be bound by
_Section 2.2_, _Article XI_ and the provisions relating to the Shareholders
Agent Committee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Immucor.

  



  

### **Section 1.8** ** Dissenting Shares.** Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding share of Matrix
Capital Stock held by a Person (a " ** _Dissenting Stockholder_** ") who has
not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has
complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders
of Matrix Capital Stock to require appraisal of their shares of Matrix
Capital Stock (" ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as described in _Section
1.6(c)_, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its
shares of Matrix Capital Stock shall be deemed to be converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for 

  



        
   

  



  

### each such share of Matrix Capital Stock in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement (it being understood that if such Dissenting Stockholder
withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its
right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its shares of Matrix
Capital Stock shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such share of Matrix
Capital Stock, without interest).  At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence. Any payments required to be made with respect to the
Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation (and not
by Immucor). Matrix shall give Immucor prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of Matrix Capital Stock received by Matrix, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and shall give Immucor the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. Matrix shall not, without the prior
written consent of Immucor, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

  

### 

  

 **Section 1.9** **Adjustments to Aggregate Merger Consideration.**

  



  

### (a) The amount of the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be subject to
the following adjustments (the " ** _Price Adjustments_** "). The Aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Decreased by an amount equal to any Indebtedness of Matrix or any
Subsidiary outstanding as of the Effective Time, including accrued but unpaid
interest and the amount of any breakage, prepayment penalties or fees payable
in connection with the pay-off of such Indebtedness as of the Effective Time.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Decreased by an amount equal to the amount due or to become due to
Lazard Freres and Co. LLC (" ** _Lazard_** ") from Matrix or any Subsidiary
arising in any way out of the Merger and the engagement by Matrix of Lazard
in connection with the potential sale of Matrix, including fees and expense
reimbursements.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) [Intentionally Omitted]

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Decreased by an amount equal to the excess of (A) the sum of
amounts paid or payable to Dissenting Stockholders _plus_ the amount of any
expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred
or paid by Matrix or the Surviving Corporation after the date of this
Agreement or by Immucor in connection with any proceedings or negotiations
with Dissenting Stockholders over (B) the amounts, calculated for each class
of Matrix Capital Stock to which Dissenting Shares belong, equal to the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration (with Aggregate Merger
Consideration being determined for this purpose without regard to the Price
Adjustment provided for in this _Section 1.9(a)(iv)_) multiplied by the
total number of Dissenting Shares belonging to the class of Matrix Capital
Stock to which such Per Share Merger Consideration applies.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Decreased by an amount equal to the sum of the following with
respect to any current or former member of the Matrix Board of Directors,
officer, employee, leased employee or independent contractor arising as a
result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with
another event): (A) any payment made or to be made in connection with the
Closing pursuant to any non-competition agreements, or

  



        
   

  



  

#### any severance, retention, closing bonus or other payment becoming
due (including any amounts paid pursuant to _Section 5.2(b)(viii)(A)
_and the total amounts payable under the Employee Bonus Plan and the Closing
Bonus Plan in accordance with their terms, but excluding with respect to
Designated Matrix Employees to the extent stated in the proviso in the fifth
sentence of _Section 5.8_); (B) the added cost to Matrix of the amount of
any compensation or benefit the time of payment of which is accelerated or
the vesting of which is accelerated (other than Matrix Options); (C) any cost
or other liability, including the value of any lost tax deduction, that
arises with respect to the payment of any amount that could, individually or
in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code; and (D) the amount of
any Indebtedness forgiven.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) Decreased by an amount equal to the sum of (A) all cash dividends,
if any, paid after the date of this Agreement and (B) all cash redemptions
or other purchases of any Matrix Capital Stock after the date of
this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) Decreased by an amount equal to the Total Option Cash Payments to
be made in cancellation of Matrix Options, as contemplated by _Section 1.7_.

  

#### 

  

#### (viii) Decreased by the amounts required pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)(ii)
_and the first sentence of _Section 6.2(b)(v)_.

  

#### 

  

### (b) Not less than five Business Days prior to Closing, Matrix will
deliver to Immucor a reasonably detailed estimate of the Price Adjustments
(the " ** _Estimated Price Adjustments_** "). Matrix will provide to Immucor
all additional information reasonably requested by Immucor to allow it to
review the calculation and amount of the Price Adjustments, including
verification from third parties as to amounts owed.  Subject to Immucors
review and reasonable approval of the Estimated Price Adjustments, the
Aggregate Merger Consideration to be payable at the Effective Time will be
increased or decreased, as applicable, based on the Estimated Price
Adjustments.

  

### 

  

### (c) Immucor shall be entitled to verify the Estimated Price Adjustments
after the Closing. If it elects to do so, as promptly as practicable and in
any event within 60 days after the Effective Time, Immucor shall deliver to
the Shareholders Agent Committee Immucors calculation of the Price
Adjustments (exclusive of any unresolved adjustments in respect of any
Dissenting Shares), which shall reflect in reasonable detail the differences
between Immucors calculation and the Estimated Price Adjustments. If there
are any Dissenting Shares, Immucor shall supplement its calculation of the
Price Adjustments within 20 days after the final resolution of all
obligations in respect of Dissenting Shares. If Immucor does not deliver its
calculations within the timeframes set forth in this _Section 1.9(c)_, the
Estimated Price Adjustments shall be the final Price Adjustments and
shall become final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this _Section
1.9_. Immucor will provide to the Shareholders Agent Committee all additional
information reasonably requested by the Shareholders Agent Committee to allow
it to review Immucors calculation of the Price Adjustments. Immucors
calculation of the Price Adjustments shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto, subject to the process of objection provided below in this
_Section 1.9_.

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) If the Shareholders Agent Committee disagrees with Immucors
calculation of the Price Adjustments, then the Shareholders Agent Committee
may, within 20 days after delivery of Immucors calculation of the Price
Adjustments, deliver a notice (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** ") to Immucor,
setting forth the Shareholders Agent Committees calculation of the Price
Adjustments and specifying, in reasonable detail, those items or
amounts affecting the calculation as to which it disagrees and the reasons
for such disagreement. If, prior to the conclusion of such 20-day period,
the Shareholders Agent Committee notifies Immucor in writing that it will not
provide a Dispute Notice, or if a Dispute Notice is not delivered within such
20-day period, Immucors calculation of the Price Adjustments shall become
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto for all purposes of this
_Section 1.9_.

  

### 

  

### (e) If the Shareholders Agent Committee delivers a Dispute Notice as
provided above, Immucor and the Shareholders Agent Committee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts. If they do not resolve all disputed items or amounts set forth in
the Dispute Notice within 15 days after delivery of such Dispute Notice, the
remaining disputed items and amounts will be submitted to BDO Seidman, LLP or
such other nationally  recognized independent accounting firm in the U.S. as
mutually agreed to by Immucor and the Shareholders Agent Committee (the " **
_Independent Accountants_** ") for resolution of such disputed items and
amounts.  Immucor and the Shareholders Agent Committee will have the
opportunity to present their positions with respect to such disputed items
and amounts to the Independent Accountants, and such disputed items and
amounts shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants in accordance with
the requirements of this _Section 1.9_; provided that the Independent
Accountants may not resolve a disputed amount outside the range defined by
the values of such amount requested by each of the Shareholders Agent
Committee and Immucor. The Independent Accountants shall prepare a written
report setting forth the resolution of such disputed items and amounts and
calculating the revised amount of the Price Adjustments, which shall
be delivered to each of Immucor and the Shareholders Agent Committee
promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after such disputed items and
amounts are submitted to the Independent Accountants.  Such revised amount
shall not reflect any difference from the amount of Immucors calculation of
the Price Adjustments other than differences required to reflect the
resolution of such disputed items and amounts by the Independent Accountants.
The revised amount of the Price Adjustments set forth on the Independent
Accountants written report shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto. The procedures set forth in this Agreement for resolution of
disputes concerning the Price Adjustments shall be final and binding on all
of the parties, and shall not be subject to appeal of any kind. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be borne by the party
whose determination of the Price Adjustments is farthest in difference from
the revised amount of the Price Adjustments set forth in the Independent
Accountants written report, with the expenses of the Shareholders Agent
Committee incurred during the process of any dispute hereunder funded from
the amounts in the Expenses Fund. Each of Immucor and the Shareholders Agent
Committee shall execute a reasonably acceptable engagement letter, if
requested to do so by the Independent Accountants, and shall
provide reasonable access to their respective employees who are responsible
for financial matters, and Immucor shall provide reasonable access to the
books and records of Immucor and its subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation.

  



        
   

  



  

### (f) Upon the final determination of the Price Adjustments in accordance
with this _Section 1.9_:

  

### 

  

#### (i) If the Aggregate Merger Consideration as calculated at the Effective
Time is greater than the Aggregate Merger Consideration when calculated with
the final Price Adjustments, then Immucor and the Shareholders Agent
Committee will execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within five Business
Days after such final determination, instructions for the payment of the
difference to Immucor out of the Escrow Fund.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If the Aggregate Merger Consideration as calculated at the
Effective Time is less than the Aggregate Merger Consideration when
calculated with the final Price Adjustments, then Immucor shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to deliver to the Shareholders Agent Committee, within
five Business Days after such final determination, for distribution by them
to the Matrix Shareholders and holders of Matrix Options as an increase to
the Aggregate Merger Consideration, cash (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) in an amount equal to the difference. Payment by the
Surviving Corporation to the Shareholders Agent Committee pursuant hereto
shall fully discharge all obligations of Immucor, the Surviving Corporation,
Matrix and their respective Affiliates to make payments to the Matrix
Shareholders and holders of Matrix Options as a result of Price Adjustments.

  

#### 

  

### **Section 1.10** ** Additional Post-Closing Consideration
Adjustments.**  The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced by (a)
the amount, if any, of Covered Damages payable to an Immucor Protected
Party pursuant to _Article XI_ and (b) upon final resolution of a Pending
Claim, the aggregate of the amounts, if any, of the Covered Damages payable
to an Immucor Protected Party pursuant to such resolution.

#### (iii) __Unregistered Transferees__. If any Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be issued or paid to a Person other than the Person in

### (f) **_Investment of Exchange Fund_**. _ _The Exchange Agent shall invest
the Exchange Fund as directed by Immucor.  Any interest and other income

Matrix Certificate.

  

### 

  

 **Section 2.2** ** Escrow.**

  



  

### (a) There shall be withheld from the cash that would otherwise be
included in the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to each holder of
Matrix Capital Stock (the " ** _Matrix Shareholders_** ") pursuant to _Section
1.6(c) _and the amounts payable to each holder of Matrix Options as
contemplated by _Section 1.7_ who agrees to be bound by this _Section 2.2_
as further contemplated by _Section 1.7_ (" ** _Participating Option
Holders_** "), cash in an amount resulting in $15.0 million (such cash being
withheld, together with any additional amounts to be withheld pursuant to
_Sections 6.2(b) _and _6.2(h)_ , the " ** _Escrow Fund_** "). To determine
the amount of cash to be withheld from each Matrix Shareholder and each
Participating Option Holder (the " ** _Escrow Amount Per Share_** "), the
amount of the Escrow Fund will be divided by the sum of the number of shares
of Matrix Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, plus
the number of shares of Matrix Capital Stock represented by the Matrix
Options held by the Participating Option Holders (such sum, the " ** _Total
Fund Shares_** "). The amount to be withheld from the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable to each Matrix Shareholder (the " ** _Individual Escrow
Amount_** ") will be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Matrix
Capital Stock owned by such Matrix Shareholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Escrow Amount Per Share and the amount to be withheld
from the cash payable to each Participating Option Holder as contemplated by
_Section 1.7_ will be determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Matrix Capital Stock represented by the Matrix Options, if any, of that
Participating Option Holder converted to cash as contemplated by _Section
1.7_ by the Escrow Amount Per Share.

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### (b) Immucor shall deliver an amount equal to the Escrow Fund to an
institution reasonably acceptable to Immucor and the Shareholders Agent
Committee as escrow agent (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** ") instead of the
Exchange Agent. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Fund as the exclusive
source of funds for the payment after Closing of any amount owed to Immucor
pursuant to _Section 1.9_ or _Article XI_. Any interest earned on the Escrow
Fund shall be retained in the Escrow Fund.

  

### 

  

### (c) By their approval and adoption of this Agreement and by their
acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Matrix Shareholders
will be conclusively deemed to have consented to, approved and agreed to be
bound by: (i) the obligations under _Section 1.9_ and _Article XI_ in
respect of post Effective Time adjustments to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration; (ii) the Escrow Agreement; and (iii) the appointment of the
Shareholders Agent Committee and the terms of _Article X_.

  

### 

  

### (d) There shall also be withheld from the Aggregate Merger Consideration
and from amounts payable to holders of Matrix Options as contemplated by
_Section 1.7_ the amount of $250,000 (the " ** _Expenses Fund_**
"), allocated to each Matrix Shareholder and each Participating Option Holder
pro rata based on the number of Total Fund Shares of each. The Expenses Fund
shall be paid over to the Shareholders Agent Committee instead of the
Exchange Agent as an advance on expenses that it may incur in performing its
duties as such and may be held and applied by it in the manner it considers
appropriate. Upon paying the Expenses Fund over to the Shareholders Agent
Committee as herein provided, neither Immucor nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any further obligations or any Liability with respect thereto. Upon the
termination of the Escrow Agreement and the release of all funds thereunder,
the balance, if any, in the Expenses Fund shall be released to the Matrix
Shareholders and the Participating Option Holders pro rata based on the
number of Total Fund Shares held by each immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The interest accrued on the Escrow Fund shall be reported to the Matrix
Shareholders and Participating Option Holders for Tax purposes on the same
pro rata basis.

true, correct and complete list of all agreements (the " ** _Third
Party Intellectual Property Licenses_** "), other than for
Commercially Available Software, (i) under which Matrix uses or has the right

### (c) The Intellectual Property owned by Matrix (the " ** _Owned
Matrix Intellectual Property_** ") together with the Intellectual
Property licensed by Matrix from others (the " ** _Licensed Matrix
Intellectual Property_** ") is all of the Matrix Intellectual Property and is

### (d) Matrix owns **** all of the Owned Matrix Intellectual Property and,
except as otherwise reflected in _Section 3.13(d) of the Disclosure Letter_,
has all right, title and interest in and to such Owned Matrix Intellectual
Property free and clear of Liens. Other than Third Party Intellectual
Property Licenses, there are no agreements that restrict or limit the use by
Matrix of the Matrix Intellectual Property. With respect to Matrixs rights

pursuant to an agreement or license which is one of the Third Party
Intellectual Property Licenses; each such agreement or license is enforceable
against Matrix and, to the Knowledge of Matrix, the other party thereto;

such license or agreement, which default or breach would constitute or
may constitute grounds on which any material license or agreement can
be terminated, suspended, varied or revoked as a result of such default or
breach by Matrix without the consent of Matrix; there has not occurred any
event which, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default; **** and, to the Knowledge of Matrix, none of
such third party licensors is in default under or in breach of any such
license or agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Matrix has taken reasonable steps to protect and maintain the Matrix

proceeding or other proceeding before any registration authority in any
jurisdiction, and all registrations and applications for the Owned Matrix
Intellectual Property are in full force and effect in all material respects
and have not been abandoned or withdrawn.

  

### 

  

### (f) All Trade Secrets are owned by Matrix free and clear of all Liens,
except as otherwise disclosed in _Section 3.13(f) of the Disclosure Letter_.
Matrix has taken all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and preserve

any Person. All use and disclosure by Matrix of Trade Secrets owned by
another Person have been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement with
such Person which is one of the Third Party Intellectual Property Licenses.

scope of their employment and constitutes "work made for hire" (as that term
is defined under Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101) with
Matrix being the person for whom the work was prepared. Matrix has secured
and has a policy to secure valid written assignments from all Persons who
contribute or have contributed to the creation or development of any of the
Owned Matrix Intellectual Property, of the rights to such contributions that
Matrix does not already own by operation of law. No employee, independent

### 

  

### (h) The use of the Matrix Intellectual Property and the conduct of the
Business of Matrix, including the manufacture, use, provision and sale of
Matrixs products and services therein, does not infringe upon,
misappropriate, violate or conflict in any way with any Intellectual Property
or other right held by any Person. Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(h)
of the Disclosure Letter_, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Matrix, threatened assertion or claim, and there has been no such assertion
or claim in the last six (6) years, asserting that Matrixs use or
exploitation of any Matrix Intellectual Property or the conduct of the
Business of Matrix infringes upon, misappropriates, violates or conflicts in
any way with the rights of any Person. Matrix is not **** a party to any
action or proceeding that involves a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of (i) any Intellectual Property of any Person or (ii) any
Matrix Intellectual Property.

  

### 

  

### (i) The Owned Matrix Intellectual Property and the Licensed Matrix
Intellectual Property, and Matrixs rights with respect thereto, including
its respective rights to use any of the Matrix Intellectual Property, are
valid and enforceable. Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(i) of the
Disclosure Letter_, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Matrix, threatened assertion or claim, and there has been no such assertion
or claim in the last six (6) years, challenging the validity or
enforceability of, or contesting Matrixs rights with respect to, any of the
Matrix Intellectual Property or any agreement relating to the Matrix
Intellectual Property.

  

### 

  

### (j) There is no basis on which any third party (other than a licensor
under a Third Party Intellectual Property License) could claim rights in, or
challenge the enforceability of, the Matrix Intellectual Property on any
equitable basis, including laches, equitable estoppel or implied license.

  

### 

  

### (k) To the Knowledge of Matrix, except as set forth in _Section 3.13(k)

**** given any notice of infringement to any third party with respect to any
Matrix Intellectual Property.

  

### 

  

### (l) All reagents, together with their current licensing status and the
amount of the research or commercial royalties or licensing fees payable for
the use of such reagents used (i) in the products currently sold or

Letter_ and (ii) in the products currently in development or

### contemplated by Matrix to be sold or distributed in the future, are set
forth in _Section 3.13(l)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter_. All such reagents
are made by Persons who are not Affiliates of Matrix. Some or all of such
reagents **** are protected by Patents or other Intellectual Property of such
un-Affiliated Persons and may require payment of royalties or licensing fees,
or other additional costs (all of which are disclosed in _Sections 3.13(l)(i)
and (ii) of the Disclosure Letter_) beyond those needed to purchase such
reagents for research use if the reagents are used in commercialized
products, or if regulatory approval for sale of products is obtained. All
royalties and licensing fees paid by Matrix for the use of reagents were
properly classified under the applicable agreement or arrangement as being
paid for research or commercial use, as applicable.

 **Section 5.8** ** Certain Employee and Employee Benefit Matters.**
 Matrix will cooperate with Immucor in allowing Immucor to interview
and otherwise evaluate Matrixs employees prior to the Effective Time. Except
as prohibited by Law, Matrix will provide Immucor prior to Closing with such
information about the employees as Immucor may reasonably request. Not
less than ten Business Days before Closing, Immucor will provide Matrix with
a list of those employees, if any, who Immucor does not wish to retain after
the Effective Time (" ** _Designated Matrix Employees_** "). Matrix
will take all actions necessary to terminate the employment of the Designated
Matrix Employees as of the Effective Time in accordance with all applicable
Laws. All severance and other costs and liabilities related to such
terminations of employment will be the responsibility of Matrix Shareholders
and shall reduce the Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.9(a)(v)_;  ** _ _provided__** ,  ** _ _however__** , that the Aggregate
Merger Consideration will not be so reduced by an amount equal to the
aggregate amount, as certified by Immucor prior to the Effective Time, the
Designated Matrix Employees would have been entitled to receive as severance
pay under Immucor policies had they been employees of Immucor as of the
Effective Time, assuming the Designated Matrix Employees had with Immucor the
same period of service and compensation that they have with Matrix. At the
direction of Immucor prior to Closing, Matrix shall take all action required
to terminate or amend the Matrix 401(k) plan to make it consistent with the
Immucor 401(k) plan before Closing. In addition, Matrix will take all
actions necessary to terminate all employment agreements, change of control
agreements and other agreements with officers, directors or employees
pertaining to employment (other than confidentiality, inventions, non-
solicitation and non-competition agreements in favor of Matrix, including
employment agreements but only to the extent employment agreements contain
confidentiality, inventions, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements
in favor of Matrix) as of the Effective Time. All termination and other
costs and liabilities that relate to the arrangements contemplated by the
foregoing sentence, including with respect to the termination of those
arrangements, will be the responsibility of Matrix Shareholders and shall
reduce the Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)(v)_.
Following the Closing, Immucor shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
all amounts due under the Employee Bonus Plan and the Closing Bonus Plan.

  



  

 **Section 5.9** ** Termination of Matrix Shareholder Agreements.**  Matrix
shall take all necessary actions required to terminate all agreements of the
Matrix Shareholders with respect to any rights whatsoever of the Matrix
Shareholders in the Matrix Capital Stock (collectively, " ** _Matrix
Shareholders Agreements_** ") including any rights granted therein with
respect to the exchange of Matrix Capital Stock for securities issued in any
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination
or similar transaction, and all such Matrix Shareholders Agreements shall be
terminated prior to or effective as of the Effective Time.

  



  

 **Section 5.10** ** Taxes.**

  



  

### (a) **_To be Filed by the Matrix Shareholders_**. The Shareholders Agent
Committee will be responsible, at its expense, for causing the preparation of
Matrixs Tax Returns for the taxable periods ending on the day before the
Closing Date, but Immucor will file such returns without any changes thereto.
As provided in _Section 5.10(c) _below, the

  

### 

  

### 38   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Matrix Shareholders will bear all such taxes, and the Matrix Shareholders
will also bear all the Taxes they and Matrix incur as a result of the Merger.
Matrix will not make any election or take any action or position on any Tax
Return filed after the date of this Agreement for or relating to any period
ending on the day before the Closing Date with respect to any item of income,
deduction or credit of Matrix that is inconsistent with any previous position
or prior reporting without the consent of Immucor (which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless required by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (b) **_To be Filed by Immucor_**. Immucor will be responsible for filing
Matrixs Tax returns (i) for any taxable period beginning before and ending
on or after (and including) the Closing Date (a " ** _Straddle Period_** ")
and (ii) for all Tax Returns of Matrix for taxable periods beginning on or
after the Closing Date.  As provided in _Section 5.10(c) _below, the
Matrix Shareholders will bear all Taxes for the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the day before the Closing Date as determined in accordance
with _Section 5.10(d) _below, but Matrix will be responsible for Taxes for
the other portions of Straddle Periods and for returns contemplated by clause
(ii) in the foregoing sentence.

  

### 

  

### (c) **_Matrix Shareholders  Payments with Respect to Taxes_**. The
aggregate amount of the Taxes on Tax Returns attributable to periods ending
on the day before the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Periods
ending on the day before the Closing Date as determined in accordance with
_Section 5.10(d) _below (the " ** _Specified Taxes_** ") is a Covered Loss
to be satisfied pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(ii)(A) _without being subject
to arbitration or other challenges by the Matrix Shareholders.

  

### 

  

### (d) **_Allocation of Taxes for Straddle Periods_**. For purposes of
_Sections 5.10(b) _and _(c) _above, whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of the Matrix Shareholders and Matrix for a Straddle
Period, the determination of the Taxes of Matrix for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the day before the Closing
Date (borne by the Matrix Shareholders) and the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on or after the Closing Date (borne by Matrix) will be
determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable
years or periods, one of which ended at the close of business on the day
before the Closing Date and the other of which began at the opening of
business on the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit of Matrix for the Straddle Period will be allocated between such two
taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that
the books of Matrix were closed at the close of business on the day before
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, will be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods
on a daily basis.

  

### 

  

### (e) **_No IRC § 338 Election_**. The Matrix Shareholders and Immucor
hereby acknowledge and agree that no election pursuant to Code § 338 will be
made by Matrix or Immucor or the Matrix Shareholders in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) **_Review of Tax Returns_**. Any Tax Return prepared by the
Shareholders Agent Committee for periods ending on the day before the Closing
will be submitted to Immucor at least fifteen (15) days before its due date
for its review.

  

### 

  

### 39   

      
 

  



  

### (g) **_Refunds_**. The net operating loss represented in _Section
3.15(g)_ is an important consideration for Immucor.  Immucor will be
entitled to any refund of Taxes with respect to a taxable period ending or
before the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (h) **_Tax Audits_**. Immucor will promptly notify the Shareholders Agent
Committee upon its receipt of any notice of pending or threatened Tax audits,
examinations or assessments with respect to taxable periods ending on the day
before or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period. Immucor will have
the right to control any Tax audit or administrative or other proceeding
relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.  The
Shareholders Agent Committee will be entitled to participate at their expense
in any Tax audit or administrative or other proceeding relating to Taxes
attributable to the period ending on or before the Closing Date or to the
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the day before the Closing Date. If a
proposed settlement of any audit or other proceeding relating to the period
ending on or before the Closing Date or to a Straddle Period would have a
material adverse effect on the Matrix Shareholders or Matrix for any period
ending on or before the Closing Date, such settlement may not be entered into
without the consent of the Shareholders Agent Committee (which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

### 

  

### (i) **_Cooperation on Tax Matters._** Immucor, Merger Sub, and the
Shareholders Agent Committee will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with any Tax matters
relating to Matrix (including the provision of reasonably relevant records or
information).

  

### 

  

 **Section 5.11** ** New Subsidiary License and Operating Agreement.**

New Subsidiary shall be amended, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the
rights and obligations of Matrix with respect to its ownership of membership
interests in New Subsidiary as set forth in _Exhibit C_.

  



  

 **Section 5.12** ** Trade Secrets Protocol.** Prior to Closing, Matrix
shall disclose to Immucor in reasonable detail the Trade Secrets included in
Matrix Intellectual Property related to those steps for producing encoded
micro-particle bead libraries and assembling them in chips, as follows: (a)
making the beads, (b) staining the beads, (c) attaching BSA to the beads, (d)
attaching oligonucliotides to the BSA, (e) assembling functionalized beads on
wafers in random arrays, (f) segmenting the wafers along etch lines into
chips, and (g) quality control; and the Trade Secrets included in Matrix
Intellectual Property related to the manufacture and process of the raw
wafers used in the aforementioned chips. The disclosure process contemplated
by this _Section 5.12_ for the manufacture of polystyrene beads will take
place over a period of at least three days. At least one day (currently
intended to be the first day) will be dedicated to the set up of the process;
at least one day (currently intended to be the second day) will be dedicated
to the actual manufacture of beads; and at least one day (currently intended
to be the third day) will be dedicated to measurement of the beads for proper
size and consistency and quality control. Disclosure sessions will be
scheduled by mutual consent of Matrix and Immucor, but not prior to the
termination of the HSR Waiting Period unless Matrix agrees otherwise.

  



  

 **Section 5.13** ** Actions to Avoid and Notices of Breaches of
Representations and Warranties.** Through the Closing, (a) each party will
inform the other promptly in writing of

result in a breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants;
and (b) without limiting the foregoing, consistent with applicable Law
(including antitrust laws), Matrix will inform Immucor promptly of any issues
or events that arise after the date of this Agreement and that are material
to Matrixs Business or prospects.

Schedule, any discrepancies or omissions noted in the minute books and stock

#### and, if applicable, the reasons it has determined it cannot issue a
standard capitalization opinion as to Matrix in form, scope and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Immucor.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Matrix shall have delivered to Immucor waivers and releases as
contemplated by the last sentence of _Section 1.7_ duly executed by each
holder of a Matrix Option.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Immucor shall be reasonably satisfied that the Final Payment
Schedule fully and accurately reflects all outstanding shares of Matrix

report referred to in clause (i) above, Immucor will not be able to refuse to
close if the conditions set forth in this _Section 6.2(h)_ are not
satisfied unless such failure (together with all Breaches and other events
and circumstances) rises to the level of or results in a Matrix Material
Adverse Effect; (y) Immucor will be entitled to withhold from the Aggregate
Merger Consideration and include in the Escrow Fund an amount reasonably
estimated by it to provide it adequate security for the failure of the
conditions set forth in this _Section 6.2(h)_, and identified possible

of one year. For purposes of the conditions set forth in this _Section
6.2(h)_ only, if any failure or breach clearly can be remedied or cured by
payment of a known amount of money, the failure or breach will not be
considered in determining whether or not a Matrix Material Adverse Effect has
occurred and Immucor will be entitled to withhold that amount from the
Aggregate Merger Consideration and include it in the Escrow Fund.

 **TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT**

  



  

 **Section 8.1** ** Termination and Abandonment.** This Agreement may be
terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) By mutual written consent of the Parties;

  



  

(b) By Immucor if any event shall have occurred as a result of which any
condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ is no longer capable of
being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to
Immucor if the condition to its obligation to perform became incapable of
fulfillment due to its failure, or the failure of Merger Sub or any of
Immucors other Affiliates, to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement in
any material respect;

  



  

(c) By Matrix, if any event shall have occurred as a result of which any
condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.3_ is no longer capable of being
satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available
to Matrix if the condition to its obligation to perform became incapable
of fulfillment due to its failure, or the failure of any of its Affiliates,
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement in any material respect;

  



  

(d) By Immucor or Matrix, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
the date six months after the date the HSR Waiting Period commences;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party whose breach of this Agreement has
resulted in the Closing not having occurred on or before said date shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(d)_; _provided further_ , that if the HSR Waiting Period has expired
during such six-month period of time but one or more other conditions have
not yet been satisfied, either Immucor or Matrix may extend such period for
up to ten (10) additional Business Days by notice to the other party given
prior to the expiration of the six-month period.

  



  

(e) By Immucor, if the condition set forth in the first sentence of _Section

 **Section 8.2** ** Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative.** The Parties
acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby are special, unique, and of extraordinary character, and
that, in the event that any Party violates or fails and refuses to perform
any covenant made by it herein, the other Party or Parties will be without
adequate remedy at Law. In the event that any party violates, fails or
refuses to perform any covenant made by it herein, the other Party or Parties
may, in addition to any remedies at Law, institute and prosecute an action in
a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such
covenant or seek any other equitable relief, including without
limitation, the right to require the other party to consummate the
transactions consummated herein. No exercise

other remedy available to such Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Matrix shall be entitled to
specific performance, including the right to require Immucor to consummate
the transactions consummated herein, only if all conditions to closing set
forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_  have been satisfied (other than _Section
6.2(c)_ which nonetheless must be satisfied in connection with Closing).

  



  

 **Section 8.3** ** Rights and Obligations upon Termination.** If this
Agreement is not consummated for any reason, each Party will destroy
or redeliver all documents, work papers, and other materials of any Party
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or
after the execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the same, except to the
extent previously delivered to third parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all information received by any Party
hereto with respect to the business of any other Party shall not at any time
be used for the advantage of, or disclosed to third parties by, such Party to
the detriment of the Party furnishing such information; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section 8.3_ shall not apply to any documents, work
papers, material or information which is a matter of public knowledge or
which heretofore has been or hereafter is published in any publication for
public distribution or filed as public information with any Governmental
Entity.

  



  

 **Section 8.4** ** Effect of Termination.** Except for the provisions of
_Sections 5.4_ , _5.6_ , _8.3_ , this _8.4_ , and  _8.5_ , and _Article IX_,
which shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in the event of the
termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to this _Article
VIII_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no further effect,
without any liability on the part of any Party hereto or its respective
officers, directors or stockholders;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that this Agreement is terminated by Immucor pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_, then Matrix shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after being notified of such by Immucor, pay Immucor all of the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Immucor or
Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 8.5** ** Investment upon Termination under Certain

of the failure of Immucor or any of its Affiliates to fulfill any
warranty, representation, covenant or other obligation under this Agreement
in any material respect, or (d) Immucor terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, Matrix shall, as its sole and exclusive remedy, have the
option to issue to Immucor, and upon the exercise of such option Immucor
shall have the obligation to purchase, Matrix Capital Stock as provided in
this _Section 8.5_; _provided_  that to exercise such option Matrix shall so
notify Immucor in writing within thirty (30) Business Days after such
termination and Immucor shall have thirty (30) Business Days after its

The Matrix Capital Stock to be issued will be Series E Stock or if a later
series of Matrix preferred stock is then being offered to
potential investors, such later series of stock.  The number of shares to be
issued in exchange for such Investment Amount shall be equal to the
Investment Amount divided by a value per share determined by dividing (x) the
equity value of Matrix as determined below by (y) the fully diluted number of
shares of Matrix Capital Stock outstanding as of the date of termination,
taking into account any anti dilution rights that may be triggered by the
issuance of Matrix Capital Stock to Immucor pursuant to this _Section 8.5_.
The equity value of Matrix for purposes of this _Section 8.5_ shall be an
amount equal to the amount that would have been the Aggregate Merger
Consideration if the Merger had been consummated on the date of termination.
In consideration of the Investment Amount, Matrix shall issue and deliver
the determined number of shares of Matrix Capital Stock free and clear of all
preemption rights, claims, contractual restrictions and other Liens. Such
shares shall when delivered be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement and except as otherwise expressly provided in the last sentence of
Section 8.2, Matrixs right to require the investment and receive payment of
the Investment Amount from Immucor pursuant to this _Section 8.5_, whether
or not Matrix elects to exercise that right, shall be the sole and exclusive,
direct or indirect, remedy of Matrix and its Subsidiaries against Immucor,
Merger Sub, and any of their respective former, current or
future stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, members, stockholders,
Affiliates or assignee of any of the foregoing (each, a " ** _Immucor
Affiliate_** ") for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, including in the event Immucor or Merger Sub
breaches its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
obligations under this Agreement, and upon payment of the Investment Amount,
none of Immucor, Merger Sub, or any Immucor Affiliate shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger

Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the Matrix
Shareholders, any provision of this Agreement may be amended if such
amendment is in writing and signed by Matrix, Immucor and Merger Sub;
provided, however, that, after receipt of approval of the Merger by the
Matrix Shareholders, if any such amendment shall, in the reasonable judgment
of either Immucor or Matrix, by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules and regulation of a stock exchange require further

  



        
   

  



  

approval of the Matrix Shareholders, the effectiveness of such amendment
shall be subject to the approval of the Matrix Shareholders in accordance

 **Section 9.4** ** Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement

good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated to the extent
possible.

waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or

the performance of this Agreement, no transfer or assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations under this Agreement prior to the
Closing may be made by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties (which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably) and any
attempted transfer or assignment without that required consent shall be void.

  



  

 **Section 9.7** ** Time of the Essence; Computation of Time.**  Time is of

the Laws of the State of New York (except as it relates to corporate law
involving Immucor, Merger Sub or Matrix, in which case it shall be governed
by the Laws of the State of Georgia or Delaware, as the case may be, and
except as it relates to the procedures for the Merger, in which case it shall
be governed by the DGCL), without giving effect to any Laws of such State
that would make such choice of Laws ineffective. Each Party hereto hereby
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State Court sitting
in Manhattan for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such
proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by
jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

 **Section 9.10** ** Entire Agreement.** This Agreement (with its Exhibits
and the Disclosure Letter) contains, and is intended as, a complete statement
of all the terms of the arrangements among the Parties with respect to the
matters provided for herein and therein, and supersedes any
previous agreements and understandings among the Parties with respect to
those matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of September
20, 2007 by and between Immucor and Matrix.

  



  

 **Section 9.11** ** Indemnification by Immucor.** If the Closing
occurs, Immucor shall indemnify and hold the Matrix Shareholders harmless
from and against any and all liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses
(including attorneys and other professional reasonable fees and costs)
suffered or incurred by the Matrix Shareholders which result from or arise
out of (i) the Breach of any representation or warranty made by Immucor or
Merger Sub in this Agreement or (ii) any breach, violation or failure to
perform of any covenant or agreement made by Immucor or Merger Sub in this
Agreement. Immucor shall not be required to indemnify the Matrix Shareholders
unless the Shareholders Agent Committee gives notice to Immucor of the facts
that the Shareholders Agent Committee determines are a basis for
indemnification on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time.
Further, Immucor shall not be required to indemnify the Matrix Shareholders
until the aggregate amount of the losses described in the first sentence of
this _Section 9.11_ incurred or suffered by the Matrix Shareholders exceeds
$200,000 and then Immucor shall indemnify the Matrix Shareholders only up to
an aggregate amount of such losses not in excess of $5,000,000.  Subject to
the foregoing provisions set forth in this _Section 9.11_, any
indemnification obligation of Immucor or Merger Sub to the
Matrix Shareholders under this _Section 9.11_ shall be satisfied by
payment of the amount of such obligation to the Shareholders Agent Committee;
_provided_ ,  _however_ that the amount of any such payment due to the
Shareholders Agent Committee may be offset against the amounts of any Covered
Damages payable to Immucor or Merger Sub as contemplated by _Article XI_. If
the Closing occurs, except with respect to Immucors obligations under
_Article I_ regarding payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, its
obligations under _Article XI_ and its obligations with respect to the
Escrow Fund, the remedies provided in this _Section 9.11_ constitute the
sole and exclusive remedies for recoveries against Immucor or Merger Sub for
breaches of the

  



        
   

  



  

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Immucor or Merger
Sub in this Agreement and for any other acts or omission relating to the
acquisition by Immucor of Matrix.

majority of the persons who would participate in the meeting and provides
information as to how those who cannot attend the meeting in person can
participate by telephone in a manner in which all the other attendees,
including others participating by telephone, can hear each other. Any such
written consent may be circulated by any member of the Shareholders Agent

members are participating, and decisions need not be unanimous but will
require the affirmative vote of at

  



        
   

  



  

### least a majority of the members. Written consents need not be unanimous
but will be effective when signed by at least a majority of the members. If a
member does not participate in a decision (whether by attendance at a meeting
or by signing a written consent), then such member will be given prompt
notice of the action taken.

  

###

be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken (or not taken) by
the Shareholders Agent Committee under any Transaction Document that appear
to have been taken in accordance with this Agreement without any duty of
inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing or other communication and
without any obligation of inquiry of any of the Matrix Shareholders.

  

### 

  

 **Section 10.5** ** Successors.** If a member of the Shareholders
Agent Committee resigns or ceases to function in his capacity as such for any
reason whatsoever, then the other members will promptly appoint a successor

the Matrix Shareholders who own (or owned) at least 51% of the Matrix Capital
Stock may appoint a successor; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if for
any reason no successor has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing
provision within 45 days, then any member of the Shareholders Agent Committee

successor. The Matrix Shareholders may at any time and for any reason remove
any one or more members of the Shareholders Agent Committee by written
consent of the Matrix Shareholders who own (or owned immediately before the

consent. The appointment of a successor pursuant to the foregoing will be by
a written instrument (i) that is signed by the requisite number of persons or
by a judge or clerk of a court competent jurisdiction and (ii) that sets
forth the explanation of how such persons satisfy the foregoing voting
requirements, and promptly thereafter a copy of such instrument will be given
to Immucor and the other members of the Shareholders Agent Committee.

Fund otherwise available for distribution to the Matrix Shareholders.

  

### 

  

 **Section 10.9** ** No Implied Agency or Partnership.** No party other
than the Shareholders Agent Committee is the agent or representative of any
other party.  Except as provided with respect to the Shareholders Agent
Committee, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to make a party liable

any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ shall survive until
the expiration of the period during which a claim for indemnification against
Immucor or Merger Sub may be made pursuant to _Section 9.11_. Notice must be

hereof qualified only by the disclosures in the section of the Disclosure
Letter specified by such Section), in order to preserve the benefit of the
bargain otherwise represented by this Agreement, agrees that neither the
survival of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, nor
their enforceability, nor any remedies for breaches of them will be affected
by any knowledge of a party regardless of when or how such party acquired
such knowledge, specifically including knowledge of a breach obtained after
the signing of this Agreement and before the Closing occurs.

  



  

 **Section 11.2** ** Covered Damages.** The Aggregate Merger Consideration
is subject to reduction as provided in this _Section 11.2_ for Covered

into after the date of this Agreement as described in clause (C) above are

representation or warranty made by Matrix in _Section 3.13_ either as of the

into after the date of this Agreement as described in clause (C) above are
deemed Third Party Intellectual Property Licenses to the extent they would
otherwise be included in such defined term had they been entered into on or

Effective Time with respect to which Immucor gives notice to the Shareholders
Agent Committee prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Time,
authorizing Immucor or any of its Affiliates to use the Intellectual Property
of any Person not an Affiliate of Immucor which is entered into based on the
determination by Immucor that in its judgment, exercised in a commercially
reasonable way, the license or royalty agreement is necessary or appropriate
to settle or resolve any claim or potential claim that is or upon assertion
would be or otherwise involve a Covered Loss under _Section 11.2(b)(i)_,
_(ii)_ or  _(iii)_. Without limitation, Immucors judgment will have been
exercised in a commercially reasonable way if it reasonably determines that
the license or royalty agreement is necessary or appropriate taking into
account the strengths and weaknesses of the positions on the Intellectual
Property, the potential costs of any litigation, arbitration, claim or other
controversy, the potential for disruption in the marketplace and the
potential costs of the license or royalty agreement, but disregarding the
adjustments to the Aggregate Merger Consideration provided for in this 
  _Section 11.2(b)_.

  

#### 

  

 **Section 11.3** ** Certain Limitations.** Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  

### 

  

### (a) **_Time Limitations_**. The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall
not be reduced by any Covered Damages unless Immucor or Merger Sub gives
notice to the Shareholders Agent Committee of the facts that Immucor or
Merger Sub determines are a basis for claiming such reduction:

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### (i) in the case of Covered General Damages, except as otherwise provided
in _Section 6.2(h)(iv)_ or  _11.3(a)(ii)(B)_ , on or before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) in the case of (A) Covered IP Damages (including with respect to
Covered License Fees) or (B) Covered General Damages arising out of or
related to any Breach (and, in the case of a Third Party Claim, any alleged
Breach) of any representation or warranty made by Matrix in _Section

#### 

  

### (b) **_Basket for Covered General Damages_**. There shall be no reduction

be reduced by the total amount of Covered General Damages. The foregoing
limitation does not apply to: (i) any Covered Loss with respect to, as a
result of, or involving a Breach of, a representation or warranty in
_Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.14_ , _3.15_ or _3.26_ ; or (ii)
any Covered Loss resulting in reduction to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Sections 11.2(a)(ii)_ through _(v)_ ; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the matters described in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) will not be taken into account in determining whether Covered
General Damages exceed $200,000.

  

### 

  

 **Section 11.4** ** Distributions from the Escrow Fund.**
Distributions from the Escrow Fund shall be made to the Shareholders Agent
Committee, for the benefit of the Matrix Shareholders, as follows:

Protected Party with respect to such Pending Claim), (iii) any Covered IP
Damages that have been deducted from the Escrow Fund before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, (iv) any Covered IP Damages subject to a
Pending Claim (in the amount reasonably estimated by an Immucor Protected
Party with respect to such Pending Claim), as of the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, and (v) any Covered IP Damages with respect to Covered

 **Section 11.5** ** Procedures.** All claims for adjustment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration under this _Article XI_ will be asserted
and resolved in accordance with the following procedures:

  

### 

  

### (a) **_Notice of Facts Forming Basis for Claim_**. Notice must be given
of facts that are the basis of a claim for adjustment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration under this _Article XI_ by the Immucor Protected Party
claiming such adjustment (" ** _Claimant_** ") to the Shareholders Agent
Committee before the expiration of the applicable time period specified in
_Section 11.3(a)_.

  

### 

  

### (b) **_Defense of Third Party Claims_**.

  

### 

  

#### (i) _Generally_. If a claim or demand for adjustment of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration is based upon an asserted liability or obligation to a
person not a party nor a successor or assign of a party (a " ** _Third Party
Claim_** "), then (and without limiting the obligations under _Section
11.5(a)_), the Claimant will undertake in good faith to give prompt notice of
any such Third Party Claim to the Shareholders Agent Committee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a failure to provide such prompt notice of a Third Party
Claim shall not prejudice any right to adjustment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration under this Agreement except to the extent that the Shareholders
Agent Committee is prejudiced by such failure. The Shareholders Agent
Committee will

  



        
   

  



  

#### defend such claims or actions at its expense with counsel chosen and
paid by it and will give written notice (the " ** _Notice of Defense_**
") to the Claimant within 30 days after the date such notice of a Third
Party Claim is deemed received that acknowledges that it is defending the
claim and that identifies the lawyer retained for the defense. If the
Shareholders Agent Committee defends a matter that involves a person with
whom Immucor has a business relationship, the Shareholders Agent Committee
will undertake such defense in a manner that has due regard for Immucors
relationship with such person. The Claimant will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim or action and to employ lawyers of
its choice for such purpose at its own expense.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Control of Defense; Exceptions, etc_.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 11.5_: (A) the Claimant will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim or action and to employ lawyers of
its choice for such purpose at its own expense; and (B) the Claimant will be
entitled to assume control of the defense of such claim and the Shareholders
Agent Committee will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers retained
by the Claimant (excluding the fees and expenses of the Claimants lawyers
before the date of such assumption of the defense), if: (1) the claim is
subject to _Section 11.2(b)_; (2) the claim or action involves any product
manufactured or sold or other work performed before the Closing; (3) the
Claimant reasonably believes that such claim or action could be reasonably
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Claimants assets, business
or reputation; (4) the Claimant reasonably believes that there exists or
could arise a conflict of interest that, under applicable principles of legal
ethics, could prohibit a single legal counsel from representing both the
Claimant and the Shareholders Agent Committee in such claim or action, and
such conflict has not been timely waived; (5) the Shareholders Agent
Committee either failed to give a Notice of Defense or has failed or is
failing to prosecute or defend vigorously such claim or action; (6) criminal
penalties or injunctive relief could be imposed on the Claimant in connection
with such claim or action; or (7) the Shareholders Agent Committee fails or
refuses to acknowledge that the Third Party Claim is a Covered Loss subject
to the Aggregate Merger Consideration adjustment provisions contained in this
_Article XI_.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) _Settlement_. The Shareholders Agent Committee may not settle any
such claims or actions without the consent of the Claimant (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) _Other_. If the Shareholders Agent Committee does not duly give the
Notice of Defense as provided above or is not defending a Third Party Claim
by reason of this _Section 11.5(b)_ or otherwise, then it will be deemed to
have irrevocably waived its right to defend or settle such claims, but it
will have the right, at its expense, to attend, but not otherwise participate
in, proceedings with such third parties. The parties will not be entitled to
dispute the amount of any Covered Loss related to such Third Party Claim
resolved as provided in the foregoing sentence, and such resolved Covered
Loss will be satisfied within three Business Days as provided in _Section
11.5(e)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) _Covered Loss for Covered License Fees_.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Covered Loss involves Covered License Fees and the
Shareholders Agent Committee did not consent or agree to the material terms
of the Reasonable License, then

  



        
   

  



  

#### in responding to the initial claim for reduction of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 11.2(b)(iv)_ with respect to such
Reasonable License, the Shareholders Agent Committee will be entitled to
contest through arbitration as provided in _Section 11.5(d)_, whether
Immucors judgment was reasonably exercised as provided in _Section
11.2(b)(iv)_.

  

#### 

  

### (c) **_Notice of Base or Determined Covered Loss_**. When a Covered
Loss as to which a notice has been timely given in accordance with _Section
11.5(a)_ is paid or is otherwise fixed or determined, then the Claimant will
give the Shareholders Agent Committee notice of such Covered Loss, in
reasonable detail and specifying the amount of such Covered Loss, and the
provision upon which the claim for adjustment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration for such Covered Loss is based (which notice will be in
addition to the notice required under _Section 11.5(a)_, but the notices
under this Section and under _Section 11.5(a)_ hereof may be given
simultaneously and in a single instrument when appropriate and in compliance
with both provisions). If the Shareholders Agent Committee is permitted to
dispute such claim, it will, within 30 days after receipt of notice of the
claim of Covered Loss against it pursuant to this Section, give counter
notice, setting forth the basis for disputing such claim, to the Claimant.
 If no such counter notice is given within such thirty-day period or if the
Shareholders Agent Committee acknowledges such adjustment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then such Covered Loss will be satisfied
within three Business Days as provided in _Section 11.5(e)_. If, within 30
days after the receipt of counter notice by the Claimant, the parties will
not have reached agreement as to the claim in question (during which time the
parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute), then the claim
for adjustment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration will be submitted to and
settled by arbitration as provided below (it being expressly understood and
agreed that if such counter notice is duly given, it is the intention of the
parties that any such claim will be resolved by arbitration as provided in
this _Section 11.5_).

  

### 

  

### (d) **_Arbitration_**. Arbitration will be by a panel of
three arbitrators experienced in the matters at issue, one of which shall be
selected by Immucor, one of which shall be selected by the Shareholders Agent
Committee, and the third of which shall be selected by Immucor and the
Shareholders Agent Committee in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the " ** _Rules_** "). The
arbitration will be held in such place in the New York, New York,
metropolitan area as may be specified by the arbitrators (or any place upon
which the Shareholders Agent Committee, Immucor and the arbitrators may
agree), and will be conducted in accordance with the Rules except as modified
in this _Section 11.5(d)_ and (regardless of any other choice of law
provision in this Agreement) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et
seq.). The claimant will request that the American Arbitration Association ("
** _AAA_** ") appoint a neutral and impartial arbitrator as the third
arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
procedures set forth in this _Section 11.5(d)_, subject to the following:
(i) the AAA will send simultaneously to each party an identical list of at
least nine arbitrator candidates (each of whom will be either a retired judge
with experience in commercial cases or a practicing attorney with at least 15
years experience with large commercial cases and some previous experience as
an arbitrator); (ii) each party will be permitted to strike two names from
the list, will rank the remaining candidates on the list, and will return the
list to the AAA within 15 days of the date of receipt; (iii) if a party does
not return the list within the time specified, all

  



        
   

  



  

### persons named in the list will be considered acceptable; and (iv) from
among the persons who remain on both lists the AAA will invite the acceptance
of the arbitrator with the highest combined ranking to serve as the third
arbitrator. The dispute resolution process will be held at the offices of one
of the arbitrators (or as the parties and the arbitrators otherwise agree),
and will be conducted according to the following provisions of this _Section
11.5(d)_. The parties will submit such factual information and materials as
they may desire to place before the arbitrators and shall respond to
questions as requested by the arbitrators, the arbitrators may hold a one-day
hearing, and the arbitrators will undertake in good faith to issue a report
(which will set forth the determined relief, but need not set forth findings
or explanations of their determination) within 30 days after the dispute is
referred to them. The arbitrators report will be based (to the extent they
consider it appropriate) on such information and on Matrixs accounting and
other records. The arbitrators will not vary the terms of this Agreement, but
rather will strictly apply them to the dispute. The arbitrators will not
award costs or fees to any party. The decision and award of the
arbitrators will be final and binding on the parties as to any matters
submitted under this Section and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. Each party will pay 50% of the arbitrators fees and expenses,
but otherwise each party will pay its own expenses in the arbitration.

  

### 

  

### (e) **_Satisfaction of Obligation for Covered Losses_**. Subject to the
procedures set forth above and in accordance with the deadlines specified in
the preceding subsections, the Matrix Shareholders liability for any Covered
Losses will be satisfied by the Escrow Agents satisfying such Covered Loss
as provided in the Escrow Agreement up to the full amount of the Escrow Fund.
Payments pursuant to the foregoing will be by wire transfer or by check, as
the Claimant may direct; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the absence of
directions within a reasonable period of time, payment may be made by check.

  

### 

  

 **Section 11.6 Certain Rules.**

  



  

### (a) **_General_**. The obligations in this _Article XI_ are for the
benefit of the stated persons, their permitted successors and assigns and
their officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates, and thus, among
other things, includes any Covered Loss incurred or suffered by a successor
owner of an operation or asset of Matrix or replacements of them;
and consistent with the foregoing, Immucor or a successor owner (but not
both) will be entitled to the extent provided in this _Article XI_ to claim
an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration for any Covered Loss
incurred or suffered by a successor owner of any operation or asset of
Matrix.

  

### 

  

### (b) **_Mitigation_**. Each party will use reasonable commercial efforts
to mitigate any Covered Loss that is potentially the basis for an adjustment
to the Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article XI_.

  

### 

  

### (c) **_Other_**. No limitation in this _Article XI_ (including _Sections
11.3_ , _11.5_ and _11.7_ ) applies to any Covered Loss with respect to, as a
result of or involving (i) any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement, whether by act or omission, intended to
mislead the party relying on it or (ii) fraud.

  



         
 

  



  

 **Section 11.7 Exclusive Remedies.** If the Closing occurs, the remedies
provided in this _Article XI_ constitute the sole and exclusive remedies
for recoveries against the Matrix Shareholders for breaches of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement and
for the matters specifically listed in this _Article XI_ as being the basis
for adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration; provided, however,
that neither the foregoing nor anything else in this Agreement will limit the
right of any Immucor Protected Party (a) to enforce the performance of
this Agreement by any remedy available to it in equity, including
specific performance or (b) to any remedy whatsoever with respect to the
Employment Agreements, the Non-Competition Agreements and the New Subsidiary
License. The Shareholders Agent Committee, on behalf of the Matrix
Shareholders, hereby waives any requirement that the party seeking such
equitable relief post a bond or other security.
