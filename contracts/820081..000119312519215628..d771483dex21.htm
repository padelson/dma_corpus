are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions); or (b) such other
time, location and date as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company mutually agree
in writing; _provided_ , _that_ the Closing Date shall not occur prior to the

17

    

_2.4_ _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
will be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time (a) all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving

 _2.5_ _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and
such certificate of incorporation (subject to _Section 6.10(a))_.

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, except that all references to Merger Sub shall be
automatically amended and shall become references to the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws
(subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_).

 

 _2.6_ _Directors and Officers_. The Parties shall take all actions necessary
so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time, in each case, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their
earlier death, resignation or removal, in each case as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and by applicable Law.

_2.7_ _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the securities described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, the following
will occur:

 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be canceled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or
Dissenting Company Shares) will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $60, without
interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in accordance with the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.11_); and 

 



18

    

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock or (B) owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub), in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Owned Company Shares"), will automatically be cancelled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid
therefor.

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), any share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Owned
Company Shares) and that is held by holders of such Company Common Stock who
have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with
respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to any such Company Common Stock held by any such
holder (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, and
holders of such Dissenting Company Shares will be entitled to receive payment
of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses their rights to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Company
Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Per Share Price for such
Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective
Time, any holder of Dissenting Company Shares will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL
and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. Parent shall have the right to direct and control
all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands. Any payments
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ delivered to the Payment Agent pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_ to pay for any shares that are Dissenting Company
Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 



19

    

_2.8 Equity Awards._

 

(a) _Company Options_. Other than as agreed to between Parent and a holder of
Company Options, at the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will
automatically, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Option has not been exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Price over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the
"Option Consideration"). Each Company Option with an exercise price per share
equal to or greater than the Per Share Price will be cancelled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) _Company RSUs_. Other than as agreed to between Parent and a holder of
Company RSUs, at the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will
automatically, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will
become the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal
to (i) the Per Share Price multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (the "RSU Consideration"),
_provided_ that with respect to any Company RSUs that constitute nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that the Company
determines prior to the Effective Time are not eligible to be terminated in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such
payment will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Company Stock Plans that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code.

(c) _Company PSUs_. Other than as agreed to between Parent and a holder of
Company PSUs, at the Effective Time, each Company PSU outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and will become the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest thereon, equal to (i) the Per Share Price multiplied
by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested
Company PSU assuming the greater of (x) target levels of performance and (y)
actual levels of performance, in both cases, are achieved, to be measured,
without any pro-ration, by the Companys Compensation Committee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "PSU Consideration", together
with the RSU Consideration and the Option Consideration, the "Equity Award
Consideration"), _provided_ that, with respect to any Company PSUs that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time are not
eligible to be terminated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plans that will not trigger a Tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(d) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate Equity Award Consideration owed to all holders
of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs (collectively, the "Equity
Award Holders"). As promptly as reasonably practicable but, in any event, no
later than five Business Days after the Closing Date, the Equity Award Holders
will be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll
system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to such holders
in respect of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are
cancelled and converted

 



20

    

 pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, less any required withholding
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_; _provided_ that to the extent any such
amounts relate to a Company RSU or Company PSU that is nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation
will pay such amounts which will accrue interest at the applicable federal
rate from and following the Closing Date at the earliest time permitted under
the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such
Company RSU or Company PSU that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

 

(e) _Further Actions_. The Company shall take all action necessary to effect
the cancellation and conversion of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs upon the Effective Time and otherwise to give effect to this _Section_ __
_ 2.8_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Prior to any such action, drafts of, and
a reasonable opportunity to comment upon, all such resolutions shall be made
available to Parent. No later than three Business Days prior to the date that
the Company provides its calculations as to the achievement of the
performance metrics applicable to the Company PSUs to the Company Board or a
committee thereof, such calculations shall be made available to Parent. The
Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments or adjustments
to such calculations by Parent prior to providing such calculations to the
Company Board or a committee thereof.

_2.9_   _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) select a
nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and
(ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock (other than
holders of Dissenting Company Shares) become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.7_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, such cash shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed
by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more
than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Payment Fund").
To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of
the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_; or (C) all or any portion of the
Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of
Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.7(a)_ for any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment

 



21

    

 Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully available
for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to
make the payments contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_. Any income from
investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and, in any
event, within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares) of one or more
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)) (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share
Price payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share Price, and the
Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares) (the
"Uncertificated Shares") will be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the
payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7_ with respect of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, such record
holder, upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request), will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares by (2) the Per Share Price, and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of
such Certificates and transfer of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_. Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

(d)  _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent shall
transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company
Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.

 



22

    

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting such exchange
present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for
surrender and transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of the Payment Agent,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by
Parent) upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Per
Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares five years after
the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.

 

 _2.10_ _No Further Ownership Rights in_ _Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Price payable therefor in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, or in
the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.7(c)_. The Per Share Price paid to such holder in accordance with the terms
of this _Article II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective 

 



23

    

 Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance
with the exchange procedures of _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

_2.11_ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 _2.12_ _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any
Law in respect of Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid in satisfaction of
the corresponding obligations hereunder.

_2.13_ _No Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

With respect to any Section of this _Article III_ , except (a) as disclosed in
the Company SEC Reports on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date of
this Agreement ((i) without giving effect to any amendment to any such Company
SEC Reports filed on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) and only to the
extent that the relevance of any such disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty set forth in this
_Article III_ is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, other
than with respect to any matters required to be disclosed for purposes of 
_Sections 3.1_ , and _3.7_ , which matters shall only be disclosed by specific
disclosure in the respective corresponding section of the Company Disclosure
Letter and (iii) other than any disclosures (other than historical
facts) contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors" or
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" or in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer, or any other disclosures that
are predictive,

 



24

    

 cautionary or forward-looking in nature); or (b) subject to the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_, as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Letter"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 

 _3.1_ _Organization; Good Standing_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing pursuant to the DGCL. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and
to own, lease or operate its properties and assets, except where the failure
to have such power or authority is not, or would not reasonably expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the

that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the

and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set
forth in its opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting
Company Shares) pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such opinion is for
the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or
Merger Sub). As of the date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been
withdrawn, revoked or modified.

Merger Sub set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ are true and correct, the Company
Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be applicable to the Merger.

_3.4_ _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only vote
or approval of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary

Contract; (c) do not, assuming the Governmental Authorizations referred to
in  _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ are made and obtained and, in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, violate or conflict with any Law applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound; or (d) will not result in the creation of any lien (other than
Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ and
_(d)_ , for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or liens that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

is required on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with (a) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company; (b) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may

 



29

    

 be, each as in effect on the date that such Company SEC Report was filed. As
of its filing date (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded filing), each
Company SEC Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made

in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q with respect to
any financial statements filed on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its

maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" and "internal control over
financial reporting" (in each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i)
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
and other documents that it files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2018, no events, facts or circumstances have
occurred such that management has not been able to complete its assessment
of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and not been able to conclude, after any such assessment, that
such system was effective. Since January 1, 2018, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor
its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received
notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications as of
the date of this Agreement. Since January 1, 2018, neither the Company nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal control over
financial reporting used by the Company and its Subsidiaries that has not been
subsequently remediated; (ii) any fraud that involves the Companys
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the
Company and its Subsidiaries; or (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, any
claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing matters in clauses (i) and
(ii).

 



30

    

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has any commitment
to become, a party to any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited

in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), in each case,

the failure of

 any condition to the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming

the Financing Letters will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. As

caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees and amounts that are
due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the

of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or
financial advisory services to any Person, in each case, in connection with
a transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in
connection with the Merger.

_4.12_ _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their

director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; (ii) the
Company; or (iii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and

all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith) and assuming (a)
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_
(without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications set forth therein), (b) the performance by the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and _Section_
__ _ 5.2_ and (c) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will exceed (A) the value of all
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis), including contingent and other liabilities; and (B) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) on their existing
debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
matured, taking into account refinancing alternatives; (ii) the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will not have an

which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged immediately following the
Effective Time; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on
a consolidated basis) will be able to pay their debts as they mature, taking

Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub

accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, and other forward-looking

the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, or business plans), and that Parent
and Merger Sub have not relied on such information and will have no claim
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, with respect thereto or any rights hereunder with respect
thereto, except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person makes or
has made any representations or warranties with respect to any estimates,
projections, forecasts, or other forward-looking information made available
to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives (including in
certain "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the Transaction).

_4.15_ _Parent and Merger Sub Information._ __ The information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first disseminated to the Company
Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

 _4.16_ _Certain Competing Businesses_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.16_
, as of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Parents Affiliates or

the lines of business in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged.

(financial or otherwise), notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any documentation,
forecasts or other information with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing.

 



45

    

 Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other Person, makes or has made
or is making any other express or implied representation or warranty with

Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, and otherwise

similar procedures designed to limit any potential adverse effect on the
Company from sharing such information.

withdraw, amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner

publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the
Company Stockholders within ten Business Days of commencement thereof pursuant
to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (2) any Acquisition Proposal is publicly

(i) the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board shall
not effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board intends
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify
the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change, including a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event; and

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, (A) the
Company and its Representatives, during such three-Business Day period, has
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters in
such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change and (B) the Company Board has taken into account any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Financing
Letters proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent in
response to the notice described in clause (1) of this _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)(i)_; or

 

(ii) if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ in order to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such

its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;

 

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition

Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that the Company Board
intends to take the actions described in clauses (A) or (B) of _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)(ii)_ and the basis therefor, including the identity of the Person or
Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies
of all material relevant agreements and documents relating to such Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period,
must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to enable Parent to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate the need to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination and (iii) in determining
whether to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the
Company Board has taken into account any adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the Financing Letters proposed by Parent and
other information provided by Parent in response to the notice described in
clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)(3)_, as applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) Parent shall only be entitled to one Notice Period for
each Acquisition Proposal and (y) no revision, amendment, update or
supplement to the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal from the
same Person or Group shall be considered a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section _5.3(e)(ii)(3)_.

 

(f) _N_ _otice_.

(i) From the date of this Agreement until the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within
48 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives receive any written or verbal
Acquisition Proposal. Within 24 hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall notify Parent in writing of each Person that the Company
considers to be an Excluded Party as of the No-Shop Period Start Date. The
Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality or other agreement subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from complying with this _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_.

 

(ii) From the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any
event, within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives (i) receive any
Acquisition Proposal or any _bona fide_ inquiries, offers or proposals that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) are
requested to provide any non-public information in connection with an

Proposal or _bona fide_ inquiries, offers, proposals or requests; and (B) the
material terms and conditions of such offers or proposals (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed Contracts, term sheets or letters of intent). Thereafter, the Company
must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and
material change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or _bona fide_
inquiries, offers, proposals or requests (including any material amendments
thereto) and the status of any related substantive discussions or
negotiations.

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company

connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer),
making a customary "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication) or from making any legally required disclosure to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to applicable securities Laws with regard to the
Transaction or an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the foregoing shall in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that such disclosure would otherwise
have under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , this _Section_ __ _
5.3(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change except in accordance with
_Section 5.3(e)_.

 

 _5.4_ _No Control of the Other Party_ __ _s Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over their own business

other covenants in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, if and to the extent necessary
to obtain clearance of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Laws
applicable to the Merger as promptly as practicable and, in any event, prior

oppose any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated,
any order, judgment, decree, injunction or ruling of any Governmental
Authority that could restrain, prevent or delay any required consents
applicable to the Merger, including by defending through litigation any
action asserted by any Person in any court or before any Governmental
Authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing
properly any adverse decision or order by any Governmental Authority,
it being understood that the costs and expenses of all such actions shall be
borne by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not without the

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the assets, business, financial condition or results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Laws, (i)
promptly notify each other Party of and, if in writing, furnish the others

documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to an
Antitrust Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed with

independently participate in any meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussions
(whether in person, by telephone or otherwise) with or before any Antitrust
Authority in respect of the Merger without giving the other Party reasonable
prior notice of such meeting or substantive discussions and, unless
prohibited by such Antitrust Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate. However, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate
any non-public information provided to any Antitrust Authority as restricted
to "outside counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared with
employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the other Party
without approval of the Party providing the non-public information; _provided_
that each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact any valuation and
related information before sharing any information provided to any Antitrust
Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis, and that the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, in any event, be required to share
information that benefits from legal privilege with the other Parties, even on
an "outside counsel" only basis, where this would cause such information to
cease to benefit from legal privilege. The Parties acknowledge that Parent
shall control and direct, and the Company will reasonably cooperate, subject
to applicable Law, with such direction and control, regarding the filings
(including where to file), strategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if
any), and related Legal Proceedings contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_;
_provided_ that Parent shall in good faith take into account comments or
suggestions of the Company or its Representatives in relation thereto. Neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be permitted, without the
express prior written consent of Parent (in its sole discretion), to commit,
agree, or submit (or offer to commit, agree, or submit) to any actions, terms
or conditions with any Antitrust Authority, or effect any such actions, in
each case in connection with any Antitrust Laws.

 

(d) _Other Actions_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.2(d_ ), Parent and
Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause each of their Affiliates not to, enter

equity syndication with respect to the Transaction or (ii) an acquisition (by
stock purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets, license or
otherwise) of any ownership interest, assets or rights in or of any Person
that, in each case of clauses (i) or (ii), would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or delay the consummation of the
Transaction.

_6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings._

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practical, and in no event later than
twenty Business Days, following the date of this Agreement, the Company (with
the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably
requested by the Company) shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") relating
to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 



58

    

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, other than any Permitted Communications, an "Other
Required Company Filing"), then the Company (with the assistance and
cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by the Company)
shall promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the
SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules of the SEC and NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or
any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

 

(c) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all information concerning
it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. If at any time prior
to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered
by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand,
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the
SEC or its Staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

 

(d) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. Subject to any
restrictions under applicable Law, the Company and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its Staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be,
without first providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such written communication, and each Party shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel.

(e) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its Staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its
Staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case
may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its Staff for
additional information in connection therewith. The Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or its Staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing.

 



59

    

(f) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and no later than four Business Days, following the filing
thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review,
or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement; _provided_ that
in no event shall the Company be obligated to mail the Proxy Statement prior
to the earlier of (x) the Cut-Off Date and (y) the first date from and after
the No-Shop Period Start Date when there is no Person that qualifies as an
Excluded Person.

 

 _6.4_ _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall establish a record date and
duly call and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "Company
Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to duly call and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting on the 20th Business Day
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure, including
adjournment or postponement thereof, and matters required by Law to be voted
on by the Company Stockholders in connection with the adoption of this
Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company
Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to  _Section_ __ _
5.3_ and unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company shall cooperate and keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and
voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement.

 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) if the Company
reasonably believes, after consultations with Parent, it is necessary or
advisable to solicit additional votes in order to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; (ii) if there are holders of an insufficient number of
shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder
Meeting; (iii) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its Staff;
or (iv) in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate
any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders. Unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
the Company will submit this Agreement and the Merger to the Company
Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board has
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

 



60

    

_6.5_ _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to_ _Financing Letters_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or
permit any withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant
to or consent under, the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing if such withdrawal, rescindment,
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing,
including by changing the amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue
discount of the Debt Financing; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or
other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing or expand the information required to be provided by
the Company or expand the information required to be provided by the Company;
(iii) expand, amend or modify any other terms to the Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing or (B)
make the timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur in any respect; or (iv)
adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing
Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (including any right
to seek or obtain specific performance of the Financing Letters). Parent
shall promptly furnish to the Company true and complete copies of any
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, consent or waiver relating
to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements relating to the
Financing; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may amend,
supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter to
add agents, arrangers, lenders and other parties thereto and to confer titles
on and assign roles to such Persons.

 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to use their, respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain
the Financing on a timely basis (but, in any event, no later than the
Effective Time) on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any "flex" provisions in any Fee Letter) set
forth in the Financing Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions therein until the consummation of the
Transaction or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement; (ii)
negotiate, enter into, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and related
Fee Letter on a timely basis on the terms and subject only to the conditions
(including any "flex" provisions in the related Fee Letter) set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee Letter; (iii) satisfy (and cause its
Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions to the Debt Financing
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements related
thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter on or prior to the Effective Time
to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub; (iv) subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_
__ _ 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing; (v) comply
with its covenants or other obligations pursuant to the Financing Letters and
the definitive documents relating to the 

 



61

    

 Financing on or prior to the Effective Time; and (vi) take all actions
within Parent and Merger Subs control to enforce its rights pursuant to the
Financing Letters, including by commencing an appropriate Legal Proceeding
against any such breaching Financing Source to compel such breaching Financing
Source to provide its portion of the Debt Financing at or prior to the time
Closing should occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ hereof. Parent and
Merger Sub shall pay, or cause to be paid, all commitment or other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when they become
due.

 

(c) _Information_. Parent shall (i) keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain
the Financing; and (ii) provide the Company with complete, correct and
executed copies of all definitive agreements and other material documents
related to the Debt Financing (which may be in customary redacted
form removing all fees and other economic terms). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice in writing (but in any event, within three Business Days after
the occurrence or discovery of) (A) of any breach (or threatened breach),
default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default),
cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing, of which Parent
becomes aware; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written
notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (1)
actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or such
definitive agreements; or (2) dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing (which shall not include customary negotiations with respect to the
terms of the Financing); (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any
time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing; and
(D) of the occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Transaction. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of
the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date that the Company delivers a written
request therefor to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to provide any update,
notice or documentation if doing so would violate any material Contract or
Law to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party or is subject or which it reasonably determines in good faith, upon the
advice of counsel, could result in the loss of the ability to successfully
assert attorney-client and work product privileges; _provided_ that Parent and
Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) provide extracts or
summaries of such protected information, (ii) otherwise provide such
protected information in a manner that does not jeopardize the applicable
protection, or (iii) obtain the required consent of any third party necessary
to provide such disclosure.

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and
related Fee Letter, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company in
writing and use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain the
Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from the same or
alternative sources on terms, conditions and costs not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee Letter ( _provided_ that such
terms, conditions and costs would not have any of the effects specified in
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_) and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing
or such unavailable and required portion thereof, as the case may be (the
"Alternate Debt Financing"); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing
commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New
Debt Commitment Letters"), which new letters will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of
any New Debt Commitment Letter (and any fee letter in connection therewith or
other agreements related thereto) to the Company. Any reference in this
Agreement to (X) the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letter" will
be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded
by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, (Y) the "Financing Letters"
shall refer to such documents as otherwise amended or modified in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and (Z) the "Financing" means the financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and
agree that none of the obtaining of the Financing or any permitted alternative
financing is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their obligation to
consummate the Transaction irrespective and independently of the availability
of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(ii)_, if the Financing has not been
obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , to
consummate the Transaction.

_6.6_ _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts,
to provide Parent and the Financing Sources with all customary cooperation as
is reasonably requested by Parent to arrange, syndicate and obtain the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts in:

(i) causing management of the Company to participate (including by making
members of management with appropriate expertise available) in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions (upon reasonable request) with rating agencies
to the extent customary for the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter at times and locations to be mutually agreed upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours;

 



63

    

(ii) providing reasonably and customary assistance to Parent and the Financing
Sources with the preparation of customary rating agency presentations and
bank information memoranda required in connection with the Debt Financing,
including executing customary authorization letters required for the
syndication of the Debt Financing in connection with the distribution of such
materials;

(iii) assisting Parent in connection with the preparation and, subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time, execution and delivery of any pledge
and security documents and other definitive financing documents as may be

that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time;

(iv) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with the financial statements
described in paragraph H of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter and such
other financial and other information as reasonably requested by Parent in the
preparation of a customary confidential information memorandum or other
customary information documents for the syndication of financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; it being understood that Parent
shall be responsible for the preparation of any pro forma financial statements
and marketing materials for the Debt Financing; 

(v) assisting in the taking of all corporate and other actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt

(vi) furnishing at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
and the Financing Sources with all customary documentation and other
information required by U.S. regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the USA PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation to the
extent requested at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ will
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms
of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to
the Effective Time; (ii) enter into any definitive agreement the
effectiveness of which is not conditioned upon the Closing (other than
customary authorization letters required for the syndication of the Debt
Financing); (iii) give any indemnities that are effective prior to the
Effective Time; or (iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination
of the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
or the Company and its Subsidiaries, breach any confidentiality obligations
or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Other than with respect to
customary authorization letters required for the syndication of the Debt
Financing, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Debt Financing will be effective until the Effective Time, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
related to the Debt Financing that is not contingent on the occurrence of the
Closing or that must be effective

 



64

    

 prior to the Effective Time. Other than with respect to customary
authorization letters required for the syndication of the Debt Financing,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ will require the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument,
including any definitive financing document, with respect to any debt
financing or adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and/or
instruments pursuant to which any debt financing is obtained or pledge any
collateral with respect to any debt financing prior to the Closing that is not
conditioned on the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall
require (A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or take any other action under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ that could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such officer or Representative; or (B) the Company Board to
approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the
Effective Time (it being understood and agreed that all such certificate,
opinion and resolution shall be delivered by any officer or board members of
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time). The Company
and its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall not be required to deliver any
legal opinions or solvency certificates prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, as it applies to the Companys obligations
relating to the Debt Financing, shall be deemed satisfied, and the Company
shall not be deemed to have breached or failed to perform or observe any
covenants, obligations or other agreements contained in this Agreement
relating to the Debt Financing, in each case, unless the Debt Financing has
not been obtained as a result of the Companys willful breach of its
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

(c) _Company Indebtedness_.

 

(i) The Company shall, not less than three Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to the Company Indebtedness to be repaid at the
Effective time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver
to Parent payoff letters, in customary form, stating the amounts required to
pay in full thereunder (and containing payment instructions) and to effect the
release of any related liens or other security interests and any guarantees
of the Company Indebtedness upon the payment of such amounts (subject to the
payment thereof at the Effective Time). The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to prepare, or cause to be prepared, for filing all agreements,
instruments, certificates, releases, termination statements and other
documents that are necessary, appropriate or advisable to evidence or effect
the releases of all such liens, security interests and guarantees.

(ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide (or cause to be
provided) to the Company funds in an amount equal to the amount set forth in
such payoff letter as the amount required for the Company to repay and
discharge in full all amounts outstanding pursuant to the Company Indebtedness
and upon the receipt thereof, concurrently with the Effective Time, the
Company shall repay and discharge such Company Indebtedness.

(d) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, or reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



65

    

(e) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives
pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will
be permitted to disclose such information to any financing sources or
prospective financing sources and other financial institutions and investors
that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to
their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to
be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are
subject to other customary confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company.

 

(f) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent shall
reimburse the Company for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives in connection with
the cooperation or obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

(g) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent and Merger
Sub from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them
in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant
to this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to
provide such indemnity to the extent arising from information furnished in
writing by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with
respect to any such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties or amounts in the case of fraud or
willful misconduct by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives.

(h) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to
include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the financing sources
or potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and such investors)
enter into any Contract prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,
investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing
or seeking to provide debt financing to any Person, in each case in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal. __

_6.7_ _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take
all actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b)
if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, take all actions within their power to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Merger.

 



66

    

_6.8_ _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access, consistent with applicable Law, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel
of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable
Law or Contract requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access
to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the
rights pursuant to, such Contract; or (d) access would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets (including source code) of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any third Persons; it being agreed that, in the event
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries asserts that any restrictions
under clauses (a) through (d) applies, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
use reasonable best efforts to design and implement alternative disclosure
arrangements to enable Parent and its Representatives to evaluate any such
information without violating such restrictions (including, in the case of
trade secrets, by providing access to such information pursuant to a
customary clean team agreement). Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be
construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals,
opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be conducted in a
manner that (i) does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by officers,
employees and other authorized Representatives of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of their normal duties or (ii) would create an unreasonable
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive or subsurface
testing or any sampling, monitoring or analysis of soil, groundwater, building
materials, indoor air, or other environmental media. All requests for access
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ must be directed to the General Counsel
of the Company, or another person designated in writing by the Company.

 

 _6.9_ _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_ _Exemption_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) (including the
disposition, cancellation, or deemed disposition and cancellation of Company
Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs) in connection
with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

_6.10_ _Directors_ __ _ and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any person
who becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the

 



67

    

 Effective Time), on the other hand (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors and administrators, an "Indemnified Person" and, collectively,
the "Indemnified Persons") with respect to any acts or omissions by such
Indemnified Persons occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of
the Company, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period,
such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner except as required by applicable Law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, and any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in effect on the
date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs,
fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted,
to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out
of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) the fact that an Indemnified
Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or
such Subsidiary or Affiliate; (ii) any action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or
taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary or Affiliate as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan), if such
action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time); and (iii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition
of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is
alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
insolvent), except that if at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving Corporation
shall advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any
counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal
Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding
for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to
this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all
liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to
be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies
or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of
which shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 



68

    

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium").
If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance carrier. In satisfaction of the foregoing obligations, prior to the
Effective Time the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect
to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed
the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail"
policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy
in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the
Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If the
Company is unable to obtain the "tail" policy and Parent or the Surviving
Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in this  _Section_
__ _ 6.10(c)_ for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Annual Premium,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to instead obtain as much
comparable insurance as reasonably available for an aggregate premium equal
to the Maximum Annual Premium.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_
may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives), the "Other
Indemnified Persons") without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or Other
Indemnified Persons are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The 

 



69

    

 rights of the Indemnified Persons and Other Indemnified Persons pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ will be in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights that such Persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter
and Bylaws; (ii) the Organizational Documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at Law or
in equity).

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will
be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

_6.11_ _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all of the Employee Plans listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.19(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will
prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. For a period of one year following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall

Continuing Employee with (i) base salary or wage rate that is no less than
the base salary or wage rate in effect for such Continuing Employee
immediately before the Effective Time; (ii) target cash incentive
opportunities that are substantially comparable to the target cash incentive
opportunities in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately before the
Effective Time; (iii) other employee benefits (excluding any equity or equity-
based compensation) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
employee benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time;
and (iv) severance and termination benefits that are substantially comparable
to those applicable to such Continuing Employee upon a similar termination of
employment immediately before the Effective Time.

(d) _New Plans_. With respect to each benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, arrangement or agreement that is made available to any Continuing
Employee at or after the Effective Time (each such plans, a "New Plan"), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such
Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and 

 



70

    

 determination of the level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals), except to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits for the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and
all New Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan
replaces coverage pursuant to a corresponding Employee Plan (such plans, the
"Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing life insurance,
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for the Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents; (iii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
the Continuing Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employees and their covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iv)
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall credit the accounts of
the Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending
account plan with any unused balances in the account of such Continuing
Employees under the Old Plan that is a flexible spending account plan.

(e) _Labor Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employees
covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement until such Collective Bargaining
Agreement otherwise expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the
parties thereto. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy all pre-
Closing legal or contractual requirements to provide notice or information
to, or to enter into any consultation procedure with, any Labor Organization
that represents any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Transaction.

 

(f) _Payment of Annual Cash-Based Incentive Compensation Programs_. Parent
agrees that it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to provide
each participant in an annual cash incentive plan (each an "Incentive Plan
Participant") who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries through the end of the year during which the Effective
Time occurs, with an annual cash incentive award for such year based on the
actual performance for such year in accordance with the terms of such plans as
in effect on the date hereof.

 

(g) _280G of the Code_. Parties shall cooperate in good faith to mitigate the
impact of Section 280G of the Code on the Company and the costs of any
related gross-up payments.

(h) _No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective

event Parent fails to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.3_ or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder and
under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to collect, if due, more

the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to

Any notice received at the addressees location, or by e-mail at the
addressees e-mail address, on any Business Day after 5:00 p.m., addressees
local time, or on any day that is not a Business Day will be deemed to have
been received at 9:00 a.m., addressees local time, on the next Business Day.
From time to time, any Party may provide notice to the other Parties of a
change in its address or e-mail address through a notice given in accordance
with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, except that notice of any change to the
address or any of the other details specified in or pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ will not be deemed to have been received until, and will be deemed
to have been received upon, the later of the date (A) specified in such
notice; or (B) that is five Business Days after such notice would otherwise be
deemed to have been received pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

_9.3_ _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, by operation of Law or
otherwise, without the prior written approval of the other Parties, except
that Parent will have the right to assign all or any portion of its and Merger
Subs rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the
Effective Time (a) in connection with a merger or consolidation involving
Parent or Merger Sub or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of Parent or the Surviving Corporation; or (b) to any Financing Source
pursuant to the terms of the Financing for purposes of creating a security
interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the
Financing, it being understood that, in each case, such assignment will not
(i) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this
Agreement; (ii) affect the obligations of the parties (including Financing
Sources) to the Financing Letters or the Sponsors pursuant to the Fee
Funding Arrangement; or (iii) impede or delay the consummation of the Merger
or otherwise materially

 



82

    

 impede the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such
Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment of this
Agreement without the consent required by this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ is null
and void.

_9.4_   _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Permira Advisers LLC and the Company have previously executed
the Confidentiality Letter Agreement, dated March 9, 2018 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), that shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Representatives shall hold and treat all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent, Merger Subs and the
Sponsors, respectively, furnished or made available to the other Party or
their respective Representatives in connection with the Transaction in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their
Representatives to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.

 

 _9.5_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Fee Funding Arrangement and the Financing Letters, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The
Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any
termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on which the
Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly
terminated by the parties thereto.

 

 _9.6_ _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to and
shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except (a) as
set forth in or as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, (b) if the Closing
occurs, for the right of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs to receive the Per Share Price and the
Equity Award Consideration, respectively, in each case after the Effective
Time and (c) as set forth in or contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_.
Notwithstanding anything set forth above, the provisions of _Section_ __ _
8.3(f)(i)_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __ _
9.10(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and this sentence in this _Section_ __ _
9.6_, shall inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources, each of whom are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof.

 

 _9.7_ _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



83

    

_9.8_ _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including, subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(ii)_, any Party
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order
to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions; (B) the Parties will be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity,
but subject to _Sections 9.8(a)_ and _9.8(b)(ii)_ , to seek an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof; and (C) will not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Partys right to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief; and (D) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to raise
any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
other security. The Parties further agree that (1) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, a Party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a
Party under this Agreement, and (2) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.8_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_
restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. This _Section_ __ _
9.8(b)(i)_ is not intended and shall not be construed to limit in any way
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3(g)(ii)_.

 



84

    

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged
and agreed that the right of the Company to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedy in connection with enforcing Parents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the
Merger will be subject to the requirements that (A) all of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions;
_provided_ , that such conditions to be satisfied at the Closing would be
satisfied if the Closing were to occur on such date and the date on which
Closing would occur if the remedy herein were granted); (B) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub are required to
and fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.3_; and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice
to Parent that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur and the Closing would occur.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Termination Date any Party initiates a Legal Proceeding to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, then the Termination Date will be
automatically extended by (A) the amount of time during which such
Legal Proceeding is pending plus 20 Business Days; or (B) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Legal Proceeding.

 

 _9.9_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Legal Proceedings (whether
based on Contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware.

 

 _9.10_ _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger or the Fee Funding Arrangement, for
and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ will affect the
right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any other state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy
arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the Fee Funding Arrangement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (c) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other

 



85

    

 request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding
arising in connection with this Agreement, the Fee Funding Arrangement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it shall not bring
any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Fee Funding Arrangement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than
the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by applicable Law.

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Source_ s. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in Law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
this Agreement, the Merger, the Debt Financing, any agreements (including the
Debt Commitment Letter) entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the performance of services
hereunder or thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in
the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party
submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any
of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document upon such Party in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2 _(or, in
the case of the Financing Sources, by registered mail addressed to them at
their respective addresses provided in the Debt Commitment Letter) will be
effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding
brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any
such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of another state).

 

 _9.11_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE FEE FUNDING ARRANGEMENT, THE
FINANCING LETTERS OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING
INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF

 



86

    

 LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __
_ 9.11_.

 

 _9.12_ _No Recourse_. Without limiting Parents rights and remedies against
the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter, this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that
are expressly identified as parties hereto, and no Parent Related Parties
(other than the Sponsors to the extent set forth in the Fee Funding
Arrangement or Equity Commitment Letter) shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise, including under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or other
Environmental Laws) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.

 

 _9.13_ _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this  _clause_ __ _
(b)_ only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure, other than with respect to any matters required to be
disclosed for purposes of _Sections 3.1_ , and _3.7_ , which matters shall
only be disclosed by specific disclosure in the respective corresponding
section of the Company Disclosure Letter.

_9.14_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and
the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"),
will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may
raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
