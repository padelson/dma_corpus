WHEREAS the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Parent and the
respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have each approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the
Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the "Merger"), whereby each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"),
other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub, the Company
or Schering Berlin Inc. ("SBI"), will be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.01(c));

  



  

WHEREAS the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Parent and the
respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have each determined
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies
and goals;

  



  

WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company (the
"Principal Stockholders") are entering into an agreement (the "Stockholders
Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, the Principal Stockholders
have agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement, to approve the Merger and to
take certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules
and

  



  

      
   



  

2

  



  



  

regulations promulgated thereunder, (b) this Agreement will constitute a plan
of reorganization, (c) Parent, Sub and the Company will each be a party
to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code
and (d) the Company stockholders who will not be "five-percent

in the form provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8(b) ("Eligible
Company Stockholders") and who exchange Company Common Stock solely for
Parent ADSs (as defined in Section 2.01(c)) pursuant to the Merger will not
recognize taxable gain with respect to the Merger pursuant to Section 367(a)
of the Code (except with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional
Parent ADSs); and

  



  

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,

set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the

"Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be

  

      
   



  

3

  



  



  

satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, Worldwide Plaza, 825

is agreed to by the parties hereto.

  



  

SECTION 1.03.   _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall file a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in
any such case, the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL.  The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time").

set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  



  

SECTION 1.05.   _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The

such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable law.

  



  

(b)  The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

  



  

SECTION 1.06.   _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

  

 _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

SECTION 2.01.   _Effect on Capital Stock._  As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  



  

(a)   _Capital Stock of Sub._  Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock").

  



  

(b)   _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to be outstanding, and no Parent
ADSs or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each share of Company Common Stock that is
owned by SBI shall not be so canceled and shall remain outstanding as one
fully paid and nonassessable share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

  



  

(c)   _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Subject to Section 2.02(e), each
issued and outstanding share (other than shares to be canceled or to remain
outstanding in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) of Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the right to receive 0.1847 (the "Exchange Ratio") American
depositary shares (each a "Parent ADS") of Parent (each Parent ADS
representing the right to receive one Ordinary Share, no par value, of Parent
("Parent Ordinary Share") and evidenced by one American depositary receipt
("Parent ADR") issued in accordance with the Deposit Agreement dated as of
October 11, 2000, as amended from time to time (the "Deposit Agreement"),
among Parent, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York (the "Depositary"),
as depositary, and all holders and beneficial owners from time to time of
Parent ADRs) (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to be outstanding, and each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger

Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in
each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), without interest.

  



  

(d)   _Anti-Dilution Provisions._  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that Parent changes the number of Parent Ordinary Shares represented by
each Parent ADS issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split, share combination, stock dividend
or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such reclassification, stock split, share
combination, stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction.
 In addition, in the event Parent pays (or establishes a record date
for payment of) any dividend on, or makes any other distribution in respect
of, Parent Ordinary Shares (other than the regular dividend of Euro0.83 per
Parent Ordinary Share), the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such dividend or distribution (other than
the regular dividend of Euro0.83 per Parent Ordinary Share).

  



  

SECTION 2.02.   _Exchange of Certificates._  (a) _Exchange Agent._  As
of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a U.S. bank or trust company
as may be designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, Parent ADRs representing Parent
ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent from
time to time as required after the Effective Time cash necessary to pay
dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and to
make payments in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs in accordance with
Section 2.02(e) (such cash, together with Parent ADSs representing the Merger
Consideration, collectively, the "Exchange Fund").

  



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall

  

      
   



  

6

  



  

mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole Parent
ADSs which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash,
if any, may be paid and the proper number of Parent ADSs may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment and issuance
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of
any cash and the issuance of Parent ADSs to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
 Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any dividends
or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

  



  

      
   



  

7

  



  



  

(c)   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ Any dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Parent ADSs represented thereby, and any cash payment in
lieu of fractional Parent ADSs shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case only upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of the whole Parent ADSs issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent ADSs and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent ADSs to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
Parent ADSs.

  



  

(d)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common_ _Stock._ All Parent
ADSs issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to this
Article II) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

  



  

(e)   _No Fractional Shares._ (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent ADSs shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or other distribution of Parent shall relate to
such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to exercise any rights of a holder of
Parent ADSs.

  

      
   



  

8

  



  



  

(ii)  Parent shall cause to be paid to each former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former holder
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing
price of a Parent Ordinary Share on the Closing Date, as such price is
reported on the Xetra system, translated into US dollars at the Euro/$
reference exchange rate as of the Closing Date published by the European
Central Bank and reported on Reuters (page ECB37) and at _www.ecb.int._

  



  

(iii)  As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates formerly representing Company
Common Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange
Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Certificates
formerly representing Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.02(c).

  



  

(f)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent ADSs and any cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs in
accordance with this Article II.

  



  

(g)   _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto or any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent ADSs, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If
any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) or any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent
ADSs pursuant to Section 2.02(e) would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration,
dividends or other distributions in respect thereof or such cash shall, to
the

  

      
   



  

9

  



  

extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h)   _Investment of Exchange Fund._  The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund in investment grade securities, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent.

  



  

(i)   _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any
unpaid dividends or other distributions in respect thereof and any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent ADSs, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(j)   _Withholding Rights._ The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though
it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market
value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such
cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

specific reference to the particular section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the information set forth in such disclosure schedule relates and
such other sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent a matter
is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information called

and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except such
governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals as, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or other assets makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement complete and correct copies of its Second Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and Restated By-laws (the
"Company By-laws"), in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement.
The minute books of the Company contain a complete and correct set of the

(e)   _Company SEC Documents._  The Company has filed all required reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all
other information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2000
(collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates,
the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act of

  

      
   



  

15

  



  



  

1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC
Documents at the time it was filed contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the
extent that information contained in any Company SEC Document filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company
SEC Documents") has been revised or superseded by a later-filed Filed Company
SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement
of material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements (including the related notes) included in the Company SEC
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of the Company as of the dates thereof and its results of operations
and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). Except as set
forth in the most recent financial statements included in the Filed Company
SEC Documents, the Company has no liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which, individually or
in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company had
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, each as defined in the
financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, in the
aggregate amount of at least $4.7 million.

16

  



  



  

connection with the issuance of Parent ADSs in the Merger (the "Form F-4")
will, at the time the Form F-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  No representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information
supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

  



  

(g)   _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with or expressly permitted by this Agreement and except as
disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents, since December 31, 2001, the
Company has conducted its business only in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice, and since such date there has not been (i) any Company
Material Adverse Change, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of
any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with
respect to any of the Companys capital stock, (iii) any split, combination
or reclassification of any of the Companys capital stock or any issuance or
the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in
lieu of or in substitution for shares of the Companys capital stock, (iv)
(A) any granting by the Company to any current or former director, officer or
other employee of, or current or former independent contractor with respect
to, the Company (each, a "Participant") of any increase in compensation,
bonus or other benefits, except for normal increases in cash compensation in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (B) any
commitment, contingent or otherwise, by the Company to pay any bonus to any
Participant (other than bonuses which have already been paid (which
bonuses amounted to $256,875 and which bonuses have been specified in
Section 3.01(g)(iv)(B) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), (C) any granting
by the Company to any Participant of

  

      
   



  

17

  



  



  

any severance, change of control or termination pay or benefits (or any
increase in such pay or benefits), (D) any entry by the Company into, or any
adoption or amendment of, (1) any individual employment, deferred
compensation, consulting, severance, termination or indemnification
agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Participant or (2) any
agreement with any Participant the benefits of which are contingent, or the
terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction
involving the Company of a nature contemplated by this Agreement (all such
agreements under this clause (D), collectively, "Benefit Agreements") or (E)
any amendment to, or modification of, any Company Stock Option, (v) any
damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that
individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to

the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any of its employees of
any confidential know-how (except by way of application for or issuance of a
patent or pursuant to a confidentiality agreement) or any lapse or
abandonment of any patent or patent application that is owned by the Company
or with respect to which the Company has an obligation to maintain pursuant
to a license or other agreement.

  



  

(h)   _Litigation._ Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents,
there is no investigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or grievance
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or specifically affecting the Company, any of its employees (in connection
with their employment by the Company) or any of its products (it being
understood that the foregoing does not include matters affecting the
pharmaceutical or biotechnical industry in general), by any Governmental
Entity or other person under any Legal Provision (as defined in Section
3.01(j)) or otherwise, that individually or in the aggregate has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, nor is
there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company that
individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no

  

      
   



  

18

  



  



  

facts, circumstances or conditions which could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any liability of, or form the basis of an investigation, suit, claim,
action, proceeding or grievance against, the Company or specifically
affecting the Company, any of its employees (in connection with their
employment by the Company) or any of its products (it being understood that
the foregoing does not include matters affecting the pharmaceutical or
biotechnical industry in general) relating to or arising under any applicable
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, which liability,
investigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or grievance, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that where this
representation entails an evaluation of the validity or enforceability of a
patent or patent application, or of whether any activity constitutes an
infringement of a patent, then any such evaluation by the Company is subject
to the normal risks and uncertainties inherent in such evaluations by patent
counsel.

  



  

(i)   _Contracts._ Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents,
the Company is not a party to, and none of its properties or other assets are
subject to, any contract or agreement that is of a nature required to be
filed as an exhibit to a report or filing under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The Company is not in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist
any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would cause such a violation of or default under) any loan or credit
agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, arrangement, understanding,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license, whether oral or
written, to which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its

Company SEC Documents. The Company is not a party to or otherwise bound by
any agreement or covenant not to compete or by any agreement or covenant
restricting in any respect the development, marketing or distribution of the

20

  



  



  

individually or in the aggregate as has not had and would not reasonably be

that the foregoing does not include matters affecting the pharmaceutical or
biotechnical industry in general) relating to or arising under Environmental
Laws, and the Company has not received any notice of, or entered into or
assumed by contract or operation of law, any obligation, liability, order,
settlement, judgment, injunction or decree relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws; and (E) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no

action, proceeding or grievance against the Company or specifically affecting
the Company, any of its employees (in connection with their employment by the
Company), any of its products or any of its owned or leased real property (it
being understood that the foregoing does not include matters affecting the
pharmaceutical or biotechnical industry in general) relating to or arising
under any Environmental Law which liability, investigation, suit, claim,
action, proceeding or grievance, individually or in the aggregate, has had or

used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Benefit Plan, or
any change in the manner in which contributions to any Benefit Plan are made
or the basis on which such contributions are determined. Except as disclosed

Liens.  To the extent that this representation entails an evaluation of
the validity or enforceability of a patent or patent application, or of
whether any activity constitutes an infringement of a patent, then any such
evaluation by the Company is subject to the normal risks

authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has the requisite corporate power and
corporate authority to enter into the Stockholders Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement by
Parent and Sub, as applicable, and the consummation by Parent and Sub, as
applicable, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the respective parts of Parent and Sub, as applicable, subject, in
the case of the issuance by Parent of Parent ADSs in connection with the
Merger, to (A) obtaining the requisite authorization (x) to repurchase Parent
Ordinary Shares and (y) to exclude any subscription rights of existing
holders of Parent Ordinary Shares by the affirmative vote of holders of not
less than a majority of Parent Ordinary Shares voting in person or by proxy
(the "Parent Shareholder Approval") at a duly convened general meeting of the
shareholders of Parent (the "Parent Shareholders Meeting"), (B) the absence
of a pending lawsuit, filed by a holder of Parent Ordinary Shares with the
requisite Governmental Entity in the Federal Republic of Germany within the
period prescribed therefor in accordance with applicable law, relating to an
objection of record of such shareholder with respect to the authorization
described in clause (A) above and (C) completing such repurchase of Parent
Ordinary Shares through a series of transactions (the "Parent Share
Authorization"). Other than the Parent Share Authorization, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub, as applicable, are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement. Subject to obtaining the Parent Share Authorization,
the Parent Ordinary Shares represented by the Parent ADSs to be issued
pursuant to this Agreement shall have been duly authorized and validly issued
and shall be fully paid and nonassessable and shall have been, on or prior to
the Closing Date, duly and validly deposited with the Depositary. Subject
to obtaining the Parent Share Authorization, the Parent ADSs to be issued
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall, when
issued, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
shall entitle the holder thereof to all rights of a Holder (as defined in the
Deposit Agreement). Each of this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and,
assuming the

thereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub,
as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

(ii)  Subject to obtaining the Parent Share Authorization and to the making
of all notices or submissions to the requisite Governmental Entities in
the Federal Republic of Germany in connection with the Parent Share
Authorization, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result
in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or other assets
of Parent or Sub under, or give rise to any increased, additional,
accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any provision of (A)
the Articles of Association of Parent or the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws of Sub, (B) any loan or credit agreement, bond, debenture, note,

governmental filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.02(c)(iii),
any (1) statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or (2) order, writ,
injunction, decree, judgment or stipulation, in each case applicable to
Parent or Sub or any of their respective properties or other assets, other

breaches, defaults, rights, losses, Liens or entitlements that individually
or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to (x)
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (y) impair the ability of Parent to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or

or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Stockholders Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement,
except for (A) the filing of a premerger notification and report form by
Parent under the HSR Act, and any applicable filings and approvals under
similar foreign antitrust or competition laws and regulations, (B) the filing
with the SEC of (1) the Form F-4 and (2) such reports under Section 13(a),

of Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement.

all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) with the
SEC required to be filed or furnished by it since September 27, 2000
(collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates,
the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such

  



  

      
   



  

35

  



  



  

Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents at the time it was
filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any
Parent SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later-filed Parent
SEC Document, none of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(e)   _Information Supplied._  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form F-4 will, at the time the Form F-4 becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii)
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.  The Form F-4 will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by
Parent or Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in
the Form F-4 based on information supplied by the Company specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form F-4.

  



  

(f)   _Interim Operations of Sub._  Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in
no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(g)   _Tax Matters._ Neither Parent, Sub nor any Affiliate of Parent has
taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that is reasonably likely to (i) prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a

  



  

      
   



  

36

  



  



  

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause
the Eligible Company Stockholders who exchange Company Common Stock solely
for Parent ADSs pursuant to the Merger to recognize taxable gain with respect
to the Merger pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code (except with respect to
any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs).

  



  

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with or expressly permitted by this Agreement and except
as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2001, there has not been
any Parent Material Adverse Change.

41

SECTION 4.02.   _No Solicitation._  (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
directors, officers or other employees or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
retained by it (collectively, the "Representatives") to, directly or
indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action
designed to, or which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal, in each case
other than a Takeover Proposal made by Parent;

  



  

      
   



  

42

  



  



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response
to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and which was unsolicited and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02, and subject to
compliance with Section 4.02 (c) and (d), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which
confidentiality agreement contains terms that are in no respect less
favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 5.04)); _provided_  that all such information is provided
on a prior or substantially concurrent basis to Parent, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the first sentence of this Section 4.02(a) by any Representative of the
Company, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the
Company. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have, and shall
have caused each of its Representatives to have, (i) terminated all
discussions or negotiations with all third parties regarding any Takeover
Proposal and (ii) requested the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information relating to the Company previously furnished to any
such third parties.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal"
means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to,
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of a
business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or the
assets of the Company, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant
to which any third party or the shareholders of any third party would own 20%
or more of the Company or any resulting parent company of the Company, or any
direct or

  



  

      
   



  

43

  



  



  

indirect acquisition, purchase or transfer, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of any rights of the Company in or to the product[s] known as
Ad5FGF-4 and any related Intellectual Property Rights or other assets or
components of Ad5FGF-4, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer not solicited by the Company
after the date of this Agreement made by a third party that if consummated
would result in such third party (or its shareholders) owning, directly or
indirectly, more than 35% of the shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all the assets of the Company and otherwise on terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (based on the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account
such factors deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, to
be reasonably likely to obtain stockholder and other required approvals on a
timely basis and to provide consideration to the holders of Company Common
Stock with a greater value than the consideration payable in the Merger,
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise.

  



  

(b)  Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub)
or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Sub) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of
Directors of the Company or any such committee of this Agreement or the
Merger, or recommend, or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or
adoption of any Takeover Proposal (other than a Takeover Proposal made by
Parent) (each such action being referred to herein as an "Adverse
Recommendation"), unless the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, based on such factors deemed appropriate by it, after consulting
with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (ii) adopt or approve, or propose publicly to adopt or
approve, any Takeover Proposal (other than a Takeover Proposal made by
Parent), or withdraw its approval of the Merger or propose publicly to
withdraw its approval of the Merger, (iii) cause or permit the Company to
execute or enter

  



  

      
   



  

44

  



  



  

into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, license agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or
which is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
4.02(a)) or (iv) agree or resolve to take any of the actions prohibited by
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 4.02 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response
to a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result
from a breach of Section 4.02(a), cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) and concurrently enter into
an Acquisition Agreement; provided however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f), and any purported
termination pursuant to Section 7.01(f) shall be void and of no force or
effect, unless the Company shall have complied with the provisions of this
Section 4.02, including the notification provisions in this Section 4.02, and
with all applicable requirements of Section 5.08(b) (including the payment of
the Termination Fee (as defined in Section 5.08(b)) prior to or concurrently
with such termination); and provided further, however, that the Company shall
not exercise its rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(f) until after the fifth Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") from the Company advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior
Proposal, identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and stating
that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) (it being understood and
agreed that, prior to such termination taking effect, any amendment to the
price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five Business Day period).

  



  

(c)  In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
Sections 4.02(a) and 4.02(b), the Company shall immediately advise Parent
orally and in writing of any request for information that the Company
reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal or of
any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably believes could

  



  

      
   



  

45

  



  



  

lead to any Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such request,
Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other
modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person
making such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.  The Company shall keep
Parent fully informed of the status and details (including amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and
shall provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company from any third party in connection with any Takeover
Proposal or sent or provided by the Company to any third party in connection
with any Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(d)  Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated

use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent
two letters from Ernst and Young LLP, the Companys independent public
accountants, one dated a date within two business days before the date on

business days before the Closing Date, each addressed to Parent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Form F-4.

SECTION 5.04.   _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall
afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives, reasonable access during normal

report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it

securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,

shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives and controlled Affiliates to
hold, all information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Neither Parent
nor the Company shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would contravene any applicable
law, rule, regulation, order or decree or would, with respect to any pending
matter, result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege or the protections
afforded attorney work-product. Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from third parties any consents or
waivers of confidentiality restrictions with respect to any information being
provided by it. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.04 or information
provided or received by any party hereto after the date hereof pursuant to
this Agreement shall affect any of the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

  



  

SECTION 5.05.   _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._  Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the taking of all
reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied
as promptly as practicable, (b) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental

  



  

      
   



  

49

  



  



  

Entities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any suit, claim, action or proceeding
by any Governmental Entity, (c) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (d) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement, or the consummation

purposes of, this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, including seeking
to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (e) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and
the Stockholders Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall (a) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement and (b) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement and otherwise
to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to require Parent to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold
separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent or
its subsidiaries or the Company.

pursuant to the terms of the Companys 1995 Stock Option Plan and 1998 Stock
Incentive Plan (collectively, and together with the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, the "Company Stock Plans"), (i)

  



  

      
   



  

50

  



  



  

each outstanding Company Stock Option (other than those granted under the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan) shall automatically accelerate so
that each such Company Stock Option shall, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, become fully exercisable for all of the shares of Company Common Stock
at the time subject to such Company Stock Option and may be exercised by the
holder thereof for any or all of such shares as fully-vested shares of
Company Common Stock and (ii) upon the Effective Time, all outstanding
Company Stock Options, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective
Time, shall terminate and shall cease to be outstanding.

  



  

(b)  As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall (i) terminate, effective at the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Plans and (ii) provide that there shall not be any additional
purchase interval, as defined in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(each, a "Purchase Interval"), commencing following the date of this
Agreement under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  If the
Effective Time occurs on or before July 31, 2002, then, with respect to the
Purchase Interval in effect as of the date of this Agreement, immediately
prior to the Effective Time each then outstanding purchase right under the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall automatically be exercised,
by applying the payroll deductions of each current participant in the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan for such Purchase Interval to the
purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions
of the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan regarding the number of
shares purchasable per participant) at a purchase price per share equal to
85% of the lower of (x) the fair market value per share of Company Common
Stock on such participants Entry Date (as defined in the Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan) into the current offering period under the Companys
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and (y) the fair market value per share of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 5.07.   _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) All
rights to indemnification and exculpation (including any rights related to
the advancement of expenses) from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company
Certificate, the Company By-laws or any indemnification agreement between
such directors or officers and the Company (in

  



  

      
   



  

51

  



  



  

each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of
the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.07.

  



  

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and correct
copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect
to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent
may substitute therefor policies of Parent or its subsidiaries containing
terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.07(c) Parent shall not be
obligated to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 5.07(c)
in excess of 150% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company
in calendar year 2001 for such purpose (which calendar year 2001 aggregate
premiums the Company hereby represent and warrant to be $222,000); it being
understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for such 150% amount.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.07(c) to the contrary, Parents obligation to
provide directors and officers liability insurance coverage under this
Section 5.07(c) shall cease immediately upon such time, if any, as Parent
shall have assumed the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Section
5.07(a), regardless of whether any such time occurs within six years from and
after the Effective Time.

  



  



  

      
   



  

52

  



  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.07 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, except that each of Parent and the Company shall
bear and pay one-half of (i) the costs and expenses incurred in connection
with filing, printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and the Form F-4
(including SEC filing fees) and (ii) the filing fees for the premerger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act and any similar foreign
antitrust or competition laws.

  



  

(b)  In the event that (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to
the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of
the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any
person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional
and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Company Stockholders Meeting has not
been held by the date that is five Business Days prior to the date of such
termination) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 15 months after such
termination, the Company enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect
to, or consummates, any Takeover Proposal (solely for purposes of this
Section 5.08(b)(i)(C), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a)
except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to 40%), (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e),
then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $7.0 million (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by Parent (x) in the case of

  



  

      
   



  

53

  



  



  

a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), concurrently with
such termination, (y) in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(e), within two Business Days after such termination and (z) in
the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section
5.08(b)(i)(C), upon the first to occur of such events.

  



  

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
Section 5.08(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 5.08(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment on the
amount of the Termination Fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made.

plan. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any written public statement with respect

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement.  Except as provided above with respect to the Merger and the

Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, (a) amend the Rights Agreement or (b) take any
action with respect to, or make any
