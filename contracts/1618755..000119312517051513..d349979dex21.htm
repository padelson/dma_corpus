ARTICLE I

The Offer 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_ _._ As promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within 10 business days) after the date of this
Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (together with
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "))
the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at
a price per share equal to the Offer Price.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_ _._ The obligations of Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
conditions set forth in Annex I (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer
Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub, and Parent and Sub may
waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at any time and from time to
time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Tender Condition which
may be waived by Parent and Sub only with the prior written consent of
the Company. Parent and Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer
Price ( _provided_ that such increase is not made primarily for the purpose of
delaying the Acceptance Time) or to waive or make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise provided in this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in
writing, Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Sub to, (i) reduce the
number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer,
(ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (v) add

terms of  _Section_ __ _ 1.01(d)_.

(c) _Adjustments to Offer Price_ _._ The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to Subs acceptance for payment of, and payment for,
Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer.

 



2 (d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_ _._ The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such date being the " _Initial Offer
Expiration Date_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that if at the Initial Offer
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied (including the Minimum
Tender Condition, but excluding any Offer Conditions that are by their nature
to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time) or waived in compliance with _Section_
__ _ 1.01(b)_, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer for
a period determined by Parent of not more than ten (10) business days.
Thereafter, if at any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied or waived in compliance with _Section_ __ _
1.01(b)_, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer on one
or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) business days
(the length of such periods to be determined by Parent); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer to
a date subsequent to the Outside Date. In addition, Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, in each case, (x) extend the Offer on one or more
occasions for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or NASDAQ or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer to a date subsequent to the Outside Date) and (y) unless the
Top-Up is then-exercisable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.03_, make
available a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule
14d-11.

(e)  _Payment_ _._ On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (and in any event within 3
business days) after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be
extended in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.01(d)_) and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The payment
for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_."

 

(f) _Termination of the Offer_ _._ If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_, then Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within one
(1) business day of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_, Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof to the extent required by the
terms of the Offer.

 



3 (g) _Offer Documents_ _._ On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ TO_"), which
shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and promptly thereafter shall mail the
Offer Documents to the holders of the Company Common Stock as required by
applicable Law. Parent and Sub shall timely file with the Commissioner of
Commerce of the State of Minnesota any registration statement relating to the
Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes.
The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Sub all information
concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities laws or
reasonably requested by Parent or Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents.
The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Board Actions and the Recommendation of the board of directors of the Company
(the " _Company Board_ "). Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all written
correspondence between Parent, Sub and their respective Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Parent
and Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect to the Offer Documents, and Parent and Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
formulation of any written response to any such written comments of the SEC
or its staff.

Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock,
or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response.

(h) _Funds_ _._ Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Offer Conditions, Sub shall provide, and Parent shall cause Sub to
provide, to a paying agent (which shall be a reputable bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company) selected by Sub (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company
Common Stock that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. In
connection therewith and with _Section_ __ _ 3.03_, Sub shall enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Company.

(i) _Withholding_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Sub is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any other provision of Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Sub.

 



4 Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_ _._ On the date the Offer Documents are first
filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_"), which shall describe and make the
Recommendation with respect to the Offer and describe the other Board
Actions, and promptly thereafter shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders
of the Company Common Stock. The Company shall also include in the Schedule
14D-9 the Fairness Opinion. Parent and Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Sub that may be
required by applicable securities laws for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be disseminated
to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent and Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent and
Sub with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, and, unless there shall have been
an Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with _Section_ __ _
6.02_, the Company shall provide Parent and Sub and their respective counsel
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff. Prior to the filing of the Schedule
14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof
to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent and Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on
such document or response.

(b) _Shareholder Lists_ _._ In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to
furnish Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of
the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with lists, copies of all lists of shareholders, security position
listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys possession
or control (or which can be obtained by the Company without unreasonable
effort or expense) regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock,
and shall furnish to Sub such information (including updated lists of
shareholders, security position listings and computer files) and assistance
as Parent or Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Sub
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, lists,
listings and files other than in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to
the Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession
or control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



5 Section 1.03 _Top-Up_.

 

(a) _Top-Up_ _._ The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable right (the "
_Top-Up_ "), exercisable on the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.03_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price that number of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_") equal to the lowest number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Sub (and, if applicable,
Parent) at the time of the Top-Up Closing (after giving effect to the Offer
Closing), shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted
Shares, but not less than one share more than 90% of the shares of the Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may not be exercised to purchase an
amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock authorized and unissued and not reserved for issuance at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up. The Top-Up shall be exercisable only once, in whole
but not in part. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Shares_ "
means all outstanding securities (including any Top-Up Shares to the extent
actually issued to Sub as of the applicable measurement time) entitled to vote
in the election of directors of the Company or on the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger, together with all such securities that
the Company would be required to issue assuming the conversion or exchange of
any then-outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations,
securities or instruments convertible or exchangeable into, or rights
exercisable for, such securities (other than the Top-Up), but only to the
extent so exercisable, convertible or exchangeable prior to consummation of
the Merger or exercisable, convertible or exchangeable as a result of the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing_ _._ If there shall have not been
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent and its Affiliates (after giving effect to the Offer Closing),
would represent at least one share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares
on the Offer Closing Date, Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the Top-Up
and on the Offer Closing Date shall give the Company written notice
specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly
owned by Parent and its Affiliates at the time of such notice (giving effect
to the Offer Closing). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt of such notice (and in any event no later than the Offer Closing),
deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information provided by
Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares and the consideration due
therefor, in each case calculated in accordance with _Section 1.03(a)_. At the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up  Closing_"),
which shall take place at the location of the Merger Closing specified in
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, and shall take place simultaneously with the Offer
Closing, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company to purchase the Top-Up
Shares shall be paid to the Company, at Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire
transfer of same-day funds, or (ii) by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer
of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of
the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase
price pursuant to the Top-Up less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the
preceding clause (x) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note (A)
shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (B) shall bear
simple interest of 3% per annum, (C) shall be full recourse to Sub, (D) may
be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and
(E) shall have no other material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company
shall cause to be issued to Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.
The Company Board has determined that the consideration for the Top-Up Shares
due under this  _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ is adequate in accordance with the MBCA
and otherwise taken all steps necessary such that upon issuance and delivery
in accordance with this _Section 1.03(b)_ , the Top-Up Shares shall be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

 



6 (c) _Exemption from Registration_ _._ Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-
Up Shares that Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be
issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "
_accredited investor_ ," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be acquired by Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(d) _No Effect on Dissenters  Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each of Parent, Sub and the Company acknowledges
and agrees that, in any proceeding under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the
MBCA with respect to Dissenting Shares, the Top-Up, the Top-Up Shares or any
cash or promissory note delivered to the Company in payment for such Top-Up
Shares will not be taken into account in connection with the determination of
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA.

 

Section 1.04 _Directors_.

 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_ _._ Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Sub of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which term herein
shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent
shall exercise its rights under this  _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_) and from time
to time thereafter, and if the Top-Up is not exercised, Parent shall be
entitled to designate from time to time such number of members of the
Company Board as will give Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, representation on the Company
Board equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, that is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed pursuant to
this sentence) _multiplied by_ (ii) the percentage of the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding that are owned by Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including all shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer as being owned as of the Acceptance Time for
this purpose); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Parents
designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective
Time the Company Board shall have at least three directors who are members of
the Company Board and who are not officers, shareholders or Affiliates of
Parent (the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ _further_ that, in such
event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for
any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent Directors (or the
Independent Director, if there shall be only one remaining) shall be entitled
to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent
Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three persons to
fill such vacancies who are not officers, shareholders or Affiliates of the
Company or Parent and who will be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act, and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any
election or appointment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_, including
(at the election of Parent) (x) subject to the Company Articles of
Incorporation, increasing the size of the Company Board, and (y) obtaining
the resignation of such number of its current directors as is, in each case,
necessary to enable such designees to be so elected or appointed to the
Company Board in compliance with applicable Law (including, to the
extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange
Act). From time to time after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be
directors on the Company Board to constitute substantially the same percentage
(rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on each committee
of the Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Law
and the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ "), and the Company
shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such
election or appointment.

 



7 (b) _Section_ __ _ 14(f) of the Exchange Act_ _._ The Company shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder as is necessary to enable Parents
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board ( _provided_ that
Parent and Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder with respect to such designees and with respect to Parents
officers, directors and Affiliates, and if not then as soon as practicable
thereafter).

 

(c) _Required Approvals of Independent Directors_ _._ Following the election
or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_
and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors then in office shall be required for the Company to
consent (i) to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to waive or elect to
enforce any of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement, (iii) to
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent or Sub, or (iv) to any other matter under this Agreement.

(d) _Effects on Continued Listing_ _._ After the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all action reasonably necessary to elect
to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Rule 5615(c)(1) of the
NASDAQ Stock Market Rules.

ARTICLE III

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_ _._ Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_ _._ Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is directly owned by Sub at such time (including all shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, whether or not such
shares are registered in the name of Sub or any of its Affiliates as of
the Effective Time) or by any Subsidiary of the Company, shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

 



10 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_ _._ Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_
and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_ _._ At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have
under this _Section 3.01(d)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has
(i) not voted in favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of
Merger, (ii) demanded and perfected such holders right to dissent from the
Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and (iii) as of
the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters
rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _
3.01(c)_, but the holder thereof, if such holder complies in all respects with
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenters  Rights_"),
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value (including interest determined
in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to
any applicable withholding Taxes specified in _Section 3.03(h)_. The Company
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that
are received by the Company for Dissenters Rights with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the

provisions of this Agreement, if there shall be any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(c)_ shall be equitably
adjusted by Parent to reflect the effect thereof.

 



11 Section 3.03 _Exchange Fund_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_ _._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall deposit,
and Parent shall cause Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be
paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_ _._ As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub
to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall
otherwise be in customary form (including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry
form)), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record
of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(c)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of
such Certificate pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ III_. No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_ _._ All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the
holder thereof as provided in this  _Article_ __ _ III_.

 



12 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_ _._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the date
that is six (6) months after the date on which the Effective Time occurs shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or its designee), upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article_ __ _ III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their
claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ III_.

(e) _No Liability_ _._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_ _._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Sub;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to the Surviving
Corporation (or its designee). Nothing contained herein and no investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration or
any holder of a Company Equity Award to receive the holders Equity Award
Amount, in each case as provided herein.

(g) _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Sub, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Sub
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration.

(h) _Withholding Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or
any holder of a Company Equity Award) such amounts as Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority by Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock or the holder of the Company Equity Award, as the case may be,
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



13 Section 3.04 _Company Equity Awards_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the
expiration of the Offer, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time,
all unvested or partially vested Company Equity Awards shall become fully
vested and:

(a) each unexercised Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder thereof
becoming entitled to receive, on the date which the Effective Time occurs, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Offer Price over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option;

(b) each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled, with the holder thereof

_by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU at the Effective Time;

Time shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled, with the holder thereof

_by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
DSU at the Effective Time;

 

(d) each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be vested as to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable pursuant to such Company PSU (i) based upon an assumed attainment of
the target level of performance applicable to such Company PSU (if the
Effective Time occurs during the performance period applicable to such Company
PSU) or (ii) based on actual level of performance (if the Effective Time
occurs after the performance period applicable to such Company PSU) (the "
_PSU Shares_ "), and, at the Effective Time, canceled, with the holder thereof
becoming entitled to receive, on the date which the Effective Time occurs, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (x) the Offer Price _multiplied_
_by_ (y) the number of PSU Shares attributable to such Company PSU; and

 

(e) each Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled, with the
holder thereof becoming entitled to receive, on the date which the Effective
Time occurs, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Offer Price
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Restricted Stock Award at the Effective Time.

 



14 (f) The payment of all Equity Award Amounts hereunder shall be subject to
appropriate withholding for Taxes in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.03(h)_, without duplication. The term " _Equity Award Amounts_ " means,
collectively, all amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_.

 

Section 3.05 _Payment of Company Equity Awards_. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, but in any event no later than fifteen (15)
calendar days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
make by a payroll payment through the Surviving Corporations or Parents
payroll provider, subject to Section 3.04(f), the Equity Award Amounts to the
applicable holders thereof; _provided_ , that any Equity Award Amount that is
considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code
shall be made at the time required under the applicable arrangement.

Effect.

 



26 (b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (to

and material Company Benefit Agreement.

 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" (or registered)
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
under applicable non-U.S. laws) has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter as to such qualification or registration from the Internal
Revenue Service (or any comparable Governmental Authority), and no event has
occurred, either by reason of any action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of any such qualification,
registration or Tax-exempt status or the imposition of any material penalty
or Tax liability, except where such loss of qualification, registration or
Tax-exempt status or the imposition of any material penalty or Tax
liability, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d)  _Section_ __ _ 4.12(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as

(other than coverage or benefits (A) required to be provided under Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA, or any other applicable Law, or (B) the full cost of which
is borne by the employee or former employee (or any of their beneficiaries)).
Each such U.S. plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company at
any time without material liability or expense to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as a result thereof other than claims incurred
prior to the date of such amendment, and no such plan, plan documentation or
agreement, summary plan description or other written communication
distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the Company from
amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit
Plan is in compliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and
its companion bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(the " _2010 Health Care Law_ "), to the extent applicable, except for such
noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The operation of each Company
Benefit Plan will not result in the incurrence of any penalty to the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2010 Health
Care Law, to the extent applicable that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



27 (e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, during the immediately preceding
six (6) years, no liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been
incurred by the Company or any trade or business, whether or not incorporated,
that together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b) of
ERISA (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") (which premiums have been
paid when due). Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the PBGC has not

Affiliate make, or was required to make, contributions during the past six (6)
years: (i) there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist on the
date hereof that could reasonably be expected to result in any material
accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, or any liability under Section
4971 of the Code; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of any such plan
equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under
such plan (whether or not vested, each as determined under the assumptions and
valuation method of the latest actuarial valuation of such plan); (iii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30 day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the
consummation of the Merger will not result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; and (iv) no material liability or contingent liability
(including liability pursuant to Section 4069 of ERISA) under Title IV of
ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate.

director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act) (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") has taken all such steps as
may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange
Act any employment compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements
that have been entered into on or before the date of this Agreement by the
Company or its Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such
arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

liability with respect to any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of
Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code).

 



28 (i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no proceeding has been
threatened, asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
anticipated against any of the Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit
Agreement (other than non-material routine claims for benefits and appeals of
such claims), any trustee or fiduciary thereof, or any of the assets of any
trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans, (ii) no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406
of ERISA) has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with respect to the
Company Benefit Plans, and (iii) no Company Benefit Plan is under, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of, an
audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Governmental Authority, and no

penalty.

Agreement that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has operated in
compliance with such sections and all applicable regulatory guidance, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(k) The consummation of the Offer or the Merger (either alone or together with
any other event) will not, in respect of any employee, officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired),
except as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (i) cause any payment or benefit to become due or payable, (ii)
increase the amount or value of any benefit, compensation or other material
obligation otherwise payable or required to be provided, (iii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefit or compensation, (iv)
accelerate the time or otherwise trigger any funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of any such compensation or benefits, or (v) cause any amount

property) to not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or be
subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after the
Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

(l) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability in respect of post-retirement health, medical

directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as required to
comply with Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law

 

(m) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made any promises or

material Company Benefit Agreement or to modify or change in any material way
any existing material Company Benefit Plan or material Company Benefit

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Company Benefit Plan that is
mandated by a Governmental Authority other than a Governmental Authority of
the United States or subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the
United States (each, a " _Foreign Company Plan_ "), the fair market value
of the assets of each funded Foreign Company Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Foreign Company Plan funded through insurance or the book
reserve established for any Foreign Company Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all current and
former participants in such Foreign Company Plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Company Plan, and no transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations. Each Foreign Company Plan has been
maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable plan document and all applicable Laws and other requirements, and
if intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, satisfies all requirements
for such treatment. Except as required by Law, no condition or term under any
relevant material Foreign Company Plan exists which would prevent Parent from
terminating or amending any material Foreign Company Plan at any time for any
reason without material liability to Parent. 

 



29 (o) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted, separately or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any amount that will not be fully deductible
as a result of Section 162(m) of the Code, except for any payment or lack of
deductibility that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

consulting, indemnification, change in control, severance or termination
agreement or arrangement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any current or former employee, officer or director of the

its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that, after giving effect
to such Proposed Changed Terms, the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation

fiduciary obligations of the Company Board (or the Committee of Disinterested
Directors) under applicable Law.

events, occurrences or facts relating to an Intervening Event, (2) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (3) material revisions to a

Notice; _provided_ that, in such event, each reference in this Section 6.02(h)
to a four (4) business day period or the fourth (4th) business day shall be

as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(i)_, the Company shall enforce,
and shall not release or permit the release of any person from, or amend,
waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver,

of the actions referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_, _Section_ __ _
6.02(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.02(g)_ except, in each case, to the extent

definitive Proxy/Information Statement and shall furnish to the Company the
information relating to it and Sub required by the Exchange Act. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with
Parent, to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC and
to cause the Proxy/Information Statement in definitive form to be mailed to
the Companys shareholders at the earliest practicable time. Each of the
Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Proxy/Information Statement if and to the extent that it shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy/Information Statement as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, in each case as, and to the extent, required by
applicable Law. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff (including any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendments or
supplements to the preliminary Proxy/Information Statement or the definitive
Proxy/Information Statement), and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
filing with the SEC or its staff, and if required, the Company shall mail
to its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such amendment or
supplement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any written responses to such SEC comments and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel. The Proxy/Information Statement shall
comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of Law.

 



52 (c) _Short Form Merger_ _._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the
Offer Closing and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up, Parent and its
Affiliates shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action,
including with respect to the transfer to Sub of any shares of Company Common
Stock held by Parent or its Affiliates, to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing (or such other time
as when Sub shall have acquired at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock) without the Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 302A.621 of the MBCA.

 

Section 7.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
financial advisors and other Representatives to, afford to Parent, and to
Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial
advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books and records and to those employees and Representatives of the Company
to whom Parent requests access, and, during such period, the Company shall
furnish to Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all financial,
operating and other data and information concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business, properties and personnel as Parent through its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other
Representatives may reasonably request (it being agreed, however, that the
foregoing shall not permit Parent or any such Representatives to conduct any
Phase I or Phase II environmental assessment). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably determines
that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or conflict with or violate any Law
(including antitrust Laws) or any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party ( _provided_ that the Company shall in such event
use reasonable best efforts to avoid such constraints on disclosure, including
entering into a joint defense agreement in customary form). No investigation
or access permitted, or knowledge obtained, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.02_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company hereunder or otherwise prejudice in
any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Sub hereunder, nor shall any
such investigation, access or knowledge be deemed to affect or modify Parents
or Subs reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made by the Company in this Agreement. Except for disclosures expressly
permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, keep confidential and not disclose, and shall
cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial
advisors and other Representatives to keep confidential and not disclose, all
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) directly or
indirectly received from the Company or its Representatives.

Control Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party shall
be required, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted,
to (x) undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to any action, if such
efforts, action or consent, individually or in the aggregate, would be
reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), assets or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) take any actions,
including the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above with
respect to Parent, its Affiliates or their respective assets, categories of
assets, businesses, relationships, contractual rights, obligations or

business or operations in connection with obtaining the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any approvals under,

action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Offer Closing.

 



54 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees
to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

later than five (5) business days after the date of this Agreement, (ii) use
its reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to take or

applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Parties shall request and shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and
Parent each shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating thereto and (ii)
keep the other apprised on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communications, and provide copies thereof in the case of any such written
communications, received by Parent or any of its Representatives, or the
Company or any of its Representatives, as the case may be, from any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to reasonable
limitations limiting access to outside counsel and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and Parent each shall, upon request by
the other, consult with the other regarding all information concerning itself,
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein (including _Section 7.03(e)_ ), Parent shall, following
consultation with the Company and after giving due consideration to its views
and acting reasonably and in good faith, direct and control all aspects of
the Parties efforts to gain regulatory clearance either before any
Governmental Authority or in any action brought to enjoin the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act or any Non-U.S. Merger Control
Law.

(e) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of
any material developments regarding, and the Company shall cooperate fully
with Parent in connection with, and shall consult with and permit Parent and
its Representatives to participate in, the defense, negotiation or settlement
of any Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of its or their Representatives to, compromise, settle
or come to a settlement arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation
unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. " _Transaction Litigation_ "
means any Litigation commenced or threatened against any Party or any of its
Affiliates by any Governmental Authority or any private party relating to,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



55 (f) Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ
to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock from
NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after such delisting.

 

(g) From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent and Sub
shall take all actions necessary or desirable to cause the representation and
warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ to be true, correct and complete
as of the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing.

 

Section 7.04 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed
to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Sub, the Offer, the Merger or the
Top-Up, including the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
thereto, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company, the Company Board and the Committee of Disinterested Directors, as
applicable, shall grant all approvals and take all action necessary to ensure
that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein
and otherwise act to eliminate, or if not possible minimize to the maximum
extent possible, the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Company
Board or the Committee of Disinterested Directors for purposes of causing any
Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 7.05 _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to honor all Company Benefit Plans and
Company Benefit Agreements, including all employment agreements with
executives of the Company, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Acceptance Time, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein. For the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending
on December 31, 2017 (or, if shorter, during the period of continued
employment of the relevant employee), Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to
provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Acceptance Time who continues employment
with Subsidiaries of Parent immediately following the Effective Time (each, a
" _Company Employee_ ") (i) base compensation and cash incentive
opportunities that, in each case, are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to what was provided to the Company Employee as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the
Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (excluding
equity-based compensation); _provided_ , that Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to honor, without any
adverse modification, the benefits listed on _Section_ __ _ 7.05(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter for the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and
ending on the date that is one year following the Effective Time (or, if
shorter, during the period of continued employment of the relevant employee).
This _Section 7.05(a)_ shall not apply to any Company Employee whose terms
and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining, works
council or similar agreement.

 



56 (b) Each Company Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any
employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
Subsidiaries, including any such plans providing vacation, sick pay, severance
and retirement benefits maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which
such Company Employees participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under
any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical or
other similar benefits), to the extent past service was recognized for such
Company Employees under the comparable Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ shall be construed to require crediting
of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits or (ii) service
credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan.

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to
Company Employees following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i)
the waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) under any
welfare benefit plans in which Company Employees participate following the
Acceptance Time, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for the plan
year in which the Acceptance Time occurs, the crediting of each Company
Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) with any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change.

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.05_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties, and
that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other person, including
any employees or former employees of the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the Company, any Company Employee, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent
or any of its Affiliates or to employment or continued employment or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, or (iii)
shall limit the right of Parent or its Subsidiaries to (A) amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries
following the Acceptance Time or (B) terminate the employment or service
of any employee or other service-provider following the Acceptance Time at
any time and for any or no reason.

 



57 Section 7.06 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase a "tail" or "runoff" officers and directors liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement for the six (6) year period following
the Closing and at a price not to exceed 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement,
which amount is set forth on Section 7.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the " _Current Premium_ "). If the Company or Parent obtains prepaid "tail"
or "runoff" policies prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this
_Section 7.06(a)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect
for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If the
Company fails to purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy prior to Closing,
then either (i) Parent may purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy on behalf
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or (ii) the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain an
officers and directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
ommisions occuring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; _provided_ _further_ ,
that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 7.06(a)(ii)_,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the Current Premium and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance that, in Parent or the Surviving Corporations good faith judgment,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of
the Current Premium.

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in
effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") made available to Parent; and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. From the Acceptance Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date
on which the Acceptance Time occurs, the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Party than are set
forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

 



58 (c) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement
of expenses to, each Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions in
their capacity as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise if
the Indemnified Party was serving in such capacity at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any case occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or provided
under the articles of incorporation, bylaws, any indemnification agreements
and any other governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any threatened or pending
Litigation to which an Indemnified Party is, has been or becomes a party or
with respect to which an Indemnified Party is, has been or becomes otherwise
involved (including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining in whole or in part to, the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise
(including any Litigation arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring or
existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred, at or prior to the Effective
Time, or arising out of or pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred by each Indemnified Party in connection with and prior
to the final disposition of such Litigations, such fees, costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and disbursements) to be advanced within thirty
(30) days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor, _provided_ that such Indemnified Party provides a written
affirmation of such Indemnified Partys good faith belief that he or she has
met all applicable standards of conduct applicable to indemnification and an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined by a final
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this _Section_ __ _
7.06(c)_ or otherwise.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party
is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved (including as
a witness) in any Litigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ shall continue in effect until
the final disposition of such Litigation.

 



59 (f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by
Contract or otherwise.

Section 7.07 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or the rules and regulations of the Toronto Stock Exchange
or any other national securities exchange or national securities quotation
system and except for any matters referred to in, and made in compliance with,
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_. The Parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form mutually agreed to by the
Parties. Prior to making any written communications to the employees
or independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent
with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.07_
shall not apply to any press release or other public statement made by the
Company or Parent (a) that is consistent with the initial press release and
the terms of this Agreement and does not contain any information relating to
the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
has not been previously announced or made public in accordance with the terms
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ or (b) is made in the Ordinary Course of
Business and does not relate to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 7.08  _Financing_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, provide all
cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested
by Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of any financing obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being
understood that the receipt of such financing is not a condition to the
Merger); provided however, that nothing in this _S_ ection 7.08 shall require
such cooperation or other action on the part of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives to the extent it would (A) unreasonably
disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives to enter into any agreement, take any
corporate action or otherwise agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or
otherwise incur any liability (other than immaterial out-of-pocket expenses
that shall be subject to reimbursement by Sub as set forth below) or give any
indemnities prior to the Effective Time. Such cooperation shall include (i)
preparing and furnishing all financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent,
(ii) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral, provided that no such
documents or agreements shall be effective prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time,
reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of such financing
and (iv) furnishing Parent and any lenders involved with such financing, with
all documentation and other information required by any Governmental Authority
with respect to such financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations. Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub
to, promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the Companys preparation
of its annual and quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with
such financing or pursuant to this _Section 7.08(a)_ , and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of such financing and any information used in connection
therewith or pursuant to this _Section 7.08(a)_ , except with respect to (x)
any information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) any
fraud or intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such
persons. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.08_ to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required under this _Section 7.08(a)_ to
cause its officers or employees to participate in any road shows or similar
events related to such financing.

 



60 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at the
Effective Time of all commitments in respect of the Existing Credit Agreement,
the repayment in full on the Merger Closing Date of all obligations in respect
of the Indebtedness thereunder, and the release on the Merger Closing Date of
any Liens securing such Indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent
prior to the Offer Closing an executed payoff letter with respect to the
Existing Credit Agreement (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf
of the persons to whom such Indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letter together
with any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in
connection with the Existing Credit Agreement relating to the assets, rights
and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing or relating to
such Indebtedness, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the
applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released and
terminated. The obligations of the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.08(b)_
shall be subject to Sub providing or causing to be provided all funds required
to effect all such repayments at or prior to the Effective Time.

Section 7.09 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
Compensation Committee will take all such steps as may be required to cause to
be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have been or
will be entered into after the date of this Agreement by the Company or its
Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

 



61 Section 7.10 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. The Company shall take all reasonable
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject
to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

rather than the Offer.

terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(i)_ __ shall not
be available to any Party if (x) the Offer Closing shall have occurred or (y)

64 Section 9.03 _Payment of Termination Amount_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(e)_, then the Company shall pay to Intermediate Parent (or its designee)
the Termination Amount by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2)
business days following the date of such termination of this Agreement, in
consideration for the disposition of Parents and Intermediate Parents
rights under this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Intermediate Parent (or its designee)
the Termination Amount by wire transfer of same-day funds, concurrently
with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination of this
Agreement, in consideration for the disposition of Parents and Intermediate
Parents rights under this Agreement.

 

(c) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have
been made to the Company Board or the Committee of Disinterested Directors or
become publicly known prior to the termination of this Agreement, (ii) this
Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 9.01(b)(i)_ or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_ and
(iii) within 12 months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for any transaction contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal (regardless of when made) or consummates any Takeover
Proposal (regardless of when made), then, in any such case, the Company shall
pay to Intermediate Parent (or its designee) the Termination Amount by wire
transfer of same-day funds on the date such transaction is consummated, in
consideration for the disposition of Parents and Intermediate Parents rights
under this Agreement. Solely for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
9.03(c)(iii)_, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_, except that all references
to at least fifteen percent (15%) therein shall be deemed to be references to
"more than fifty percent (50%)".

(d) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in an award against the Company for such
amount, the Company shall pay to Intermediate Parent (or its designee)
Parents, Intermediate Parents and Subs costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the applicable amount from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in
_The_ _Wall_ _Street_ _Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. In no event shall the Company be required to pay any
termination amount on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (x) if Intermediate Parent (or its designee)
receives the Termination Amount from the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.03_, then, any such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, equity holders,
managers, members or Affiliates and none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (y) if Intermediate
Parent (or its designee) receives any payments from the Company in respect of
any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Intermediate Parent (or its
designee) is entitled to receive the Termination Amount under _Section_ __ _
9.03_, the amount of such Termination Amount shall be reduced by the aggregate
amount of any payments made by the Company to Sub (or its designee) in
respect of any such breaches of this Agreement.

 



65 Section 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any
time before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or receipt of the
Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) after the Offer
Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Offer Price or the
Merger Consideration, and (y) after the Shareholder Approval has been
obtained (if applicable), there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

Section 9.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) to the extent permitted by
Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to the
proviso to the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.04_ and to the extent
permitted by Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of, or an
Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) The table of contents, headings and index of defined terms contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect of the word "shall." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which
a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
The word "or" when used in this Agreement is not exclusive.

 



73 (d) The phrase "made available," when used in reference to anything made
available to Parent, Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed to mean
that such item has been provided in writing to Parent, Sub or their
Representatives prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the Party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 

(f) References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein.

(g) All capitalized terms not defined in the Company Disclosure Letter shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement. Any information set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to
which it corresponds in number and each other Section or subsection of this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
information is relevant to such other Section or subsection. No disclosure in
the Company Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation of
any contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

(h) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

(i) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 

(j) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires
Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Sub to take such action.

75 Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

Section 11.05 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.06_, (b) the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of
the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and (c) the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of the holders of the
Company Equity Awards to receive the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _
3.04_, neither this Agreement nor any other agreement contemplated hereby are
intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the Parties hereto and
thereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.05_ without notice or liability to any other
person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters.

Section 11.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, and any assignment without such consent shall

Parent and Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to Parent
or any of its Affiliates and/or to the lenders party to the Parent Credit
Agreement from time to time (including for purposes of creating a security
interest herein or otherwise assign as collateral in respect of obtaining
financing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 11.07 _GOVERNING LAW_. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA ARE MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER (INCLUDING THE EXERCISE OF
THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE COMPANY BOARD AND THE COMMITTEE OF DISINTERESTED
DIRECTORS), IN WHICH CASE MINNESOTA LAW SHALL GOVERN, THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY
LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE
HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE
GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

 



76 Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the United
States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware
for the purpose of any Litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating
to arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined, exclusively
in such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any action or proceeding
so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such party at the
addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.03_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
11.08_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

 

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING
TO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING ANY FINANCING OBTAINED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT) OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE
HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION.

 



77 Section 11.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for
specific performance to be an available remedy for breaches of this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in _Section_ __ _ 11.08_, without proof of actual damages,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance
on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy for any such breach. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.10_ are an integral part
of the Merger, the Offer and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or
any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 11.10_, and each Party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 11.11 _Non-Recourse_. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and Representatives, that all proceedings, claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or any other
agreement referenced herein or the transactions contemplated hereunder
(including any financing obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (B) the negotiation, execution
or performance this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, this Agreement or such other agreement), (C) any breach or
violation of this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein and (D)
any failure of the transactions contemplated hereunder or any other agreement
referenced herein (including any agreement in respect of financing obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to be
consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of)
the persons that are expressly identified herein as parties to this Agreement
and, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other agreement
referenced herein or otherwise to the contrary, each Party covenants, agrees
and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates and
Representatives, that no recourse under this Agreement or any other agreement
referenced herein or in connection with any transactions contemplated hereby
(including any financing obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) shall be sought or had against any other
person and no other person shall have any liabilities or obligations (whether
in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by
statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other
theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) for any claims, causes
of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection
with or related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (A) through
(D), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or
losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by
any of the aforementioned, as such, arising under, out of, in connection with
or related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (A) through (D),
in each case, except for claims that any Party may assert against another
Party solely in accordance with, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of,
this Agreement.

 



78 Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner.

 

Section 11.13 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed
and delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications
by portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.

[Signature Page to the Merger Agreement] ANNEX I

 

 _Conditions to the Offer_

 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not
be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Sub to, accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Subs obligation
to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after
the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if: (a) there shall have not been
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Affiliates, would
represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares as of the expiration
of the Offer (without giving effect to the Top-Up Closing) (the " _Minimum
Tender Condition_ "); (b) the waiting period applicable to the purchase of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of
the Merger under the HSR Act (or any extension thereof) shall have neither
expired nor terminated; or (c) any of the following conditions shall have
occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer: 

(i) there shall be any Restraint in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing
or prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or
the Offer;

(ii) the consummation of the Offer is unlawful under any Non-U.S. Merger
Control Law;

(iii) (A) the representation and warranty of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.07(a)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date
of this Agreement, (B) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.04_ shall not be true and correct in all material
respects as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time, except
to the extent such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific
date (in which case on and as of such specific date), (C) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ shall not be
true and correct except for _de_ _minimis_ inaccuracies as of the consummation
of the Offer, as if made at such time, except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case
on and as of such specific date), and (D) each of the other representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true
and correct as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time,
except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to
a specific date (in which case on and as of such specific date), other than
in the case of clause (D) for such failures to be true and correct that (alone
or in the aggregate with all such other failures of representations and
warranties of the Company under this Agreement to be true and correct) have
not had a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this purpose
all references to the term "Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications
based on the word "material," set forth in any such representations
and warranties shall be disregarded);

 



Annex I-1 (iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement;

(v) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(vi) in the event that the exercise of the Top-Up is necessary to ensure that
Sub owns at least 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares immediately after the
Acceptance Time, there shall exist any Restraint or other prohibition under
applicable Law on Subs ability and right to exercise the Top-Up or the
Companys ability and authority to issue the Top-Up Shares pursuant to and in
accordance with such exercise, or the shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Top-Up together with the shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn are insufficient for
Sub to own at least one share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares;

 

(vii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;
and

 

(viii) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in clauses (c)(iii), (c)(iv) and (c)(v) above shall have occurred and be
continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.
