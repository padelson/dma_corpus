applicable under such MidSouth Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including vesting terms), and relating to the number of
shares of Hancock Whitney Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of MidSouth Common Stock subject to such MidSouth Restricted Stock

reasonably acceptable to MidSouth (the " _Conversion Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of MidSouth Common Stock contemplated by Section
1.5(a) and, if any MidSouth Preferred Stock shall be converted to New Hancock
Whitney Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d) or 1.5(e), the holders of

interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Hancock Whitney.

2.2 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) _Procedures for_ _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter,
Hancock

 



-6- 

    

 Whitney shall cause the Conversion Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of MidSouth Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") and whose
shares have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Conversion Agent, and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional share which the shares of
MidSouth Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as
well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b),
and the Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of non-certificated shares of
MidSouth Common Stock represented by book-entry immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I shall be
required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal in respect of such
Book-Entry Shares or surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Conversion Agent
in order to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each Book-Entry
Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and
Hancock Whitney shall cause the Conversion Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of a fractional share which the share of MidSouth Common Stock formerly
represented by such Book-Entry Share shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Book-Entry Share
shall forthwith be cancelled.

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a
Book-Entry Share, in each case as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of a fractional share or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
Hancock Whitney Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate on unpaid Book-Entry Share until such Certificate is surrendered
or such Book-Entry Share is paid, in each case in accordance with this Article
II. After the surrender of a Certificate or payment of a Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole
shares of Hancock Whitney Common Stock which the shares of MidSouth Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted
into the right to receive (after giving effect to Section 6.10).

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of a
fractional share or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this Section 2.2) is

 



-7- 

    

 to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of the
payment thereof that:

 

(i) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer or (B) the Book-Entry Share is properly transferred;
and

 

(ii) the person requesting such payment shall (A) pay to the Conversion
Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
such payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, or required for any other reason, or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Conversion Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of MidSouth of the shares of MidSouth Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Conversion Agent, they shall be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting
such Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
fractional shares of Hancock Whitney Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Hancock Whitney Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Hancock
Whitney. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Hancock Whitney
shall pay to each former shareholder of MidSouth who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by _multiplying_ (i) the average of the closing sale
prices of Hancock Whitney Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the "
_NASDAQ_ ") as reported by the _Wall Street Journal_ for the five (5) full
trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Hancock
Whitney Share Closing Price_ ") _by_ (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to
the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Hancock Whitney
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.5.

 

(f) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of MidSouth for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Company. Any former shareholders of MidSouth who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of any fractional share and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Hancock Whitney Common Stock deliverable to each such former shareholder
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Hancock Whitney, MidSouth, the
Surviving Company, the Conversion Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former shareholder of MidSouth for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 



-8- 

    

(g) Hancock Whitney shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Conversion Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Hancock Whitney Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other cash amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of MidSouth Common Stock or
MidSouth Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Hancock Whitney or the Conversion Agent, as the case may be, and paid over
to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to any such
holder in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Hancock
Whitney or the Conversion Agent, as the case may be.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Hancock
Whitney, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Hancock
Whitney may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Conversion
Agent will issue in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional share and dividends
or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) In the event that any MidSouth Preferred Stock shall be converted to
New Hancock Whitney Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d) or 1.5(e), the
conversion procedures set forth in this Section 2.2 shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ to such conversion.

 

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MIDSOUTH

Except as (a) disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by MidSouth to
Hancock Whitney concurrently herewith (the " _MidSouth Disclosure Schedule_
"); _provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii)
the mere inclusion of an item in the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
MidSouth that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on MidSouth and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of this Article III shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other section
of this Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (B) other
sections of this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections,
or (b) disclosed in any MidSouth Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by
MidSouth after January 1, 2018 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding
risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or
disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking

 



-9- 

    

 statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature),
MidSouth hereby represents and warrants to Hancock Whitney as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) MidSouth is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Louisiana and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(" _BHC Act_ "). MidSouth has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. MidSouth is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth.
As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with
respect to MidSouth, any event, circumstance, development, change or effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, (i) has a material adverse effect on
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes,
after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after
the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to
companies in the industries in which MidSouth and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism), (D) changes, after the
date hereof, in economic or market conditions affecting the financial services
industry generally and not specifically relating to MidSouth or its
Subsidiaries, (E) failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or
internal financial forecasts, but not including the underlying causes thereof,
(F) disclosure or (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of
the representations set forth in Sections 3.3(b), 3.4 and 3.11(k), and for
purposes of the related condition set forth in Section 7.2(a)) consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this
Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (G)
actions or omissions taken pursuant to the written consent of Hancock Whitney;
except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that
the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other companies in the industry in which MidSouth and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially impair,
the ability of MidSouth to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ ," when used with
respect to any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, bank or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. True
and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of
MidSouth (the " _MidSouth Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
MidSouth (the " _MidSouth Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by MidSouth to Hancock Whitney.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of MidSouth (a " _MidSouth Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or

 



-10- 

    

 leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect on MidSouth and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Except as set forth on Section 3.1(b) of the MidSouth Disclosure
Schedule, there are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
MidSouth to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary
that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of MidSouth that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "
_FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by
law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of MidSouth, threatened. Section
3.1(b) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all Subsidiaries of MidSouth as of the date hereof.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of MidSouth consists of 30,000,000 shares
of MidSouth Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par
value per share. As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of MidSouth are issued, reserved for issuance or

performance-vesting MidSouth RSU Awards, (vi) 32,000 shares of

shares of MidSouth Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of MidSouth Common Stock and MidSouth Preferred
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof, subject, in the case of MidSouth Equity
Awards, to the terms and conditions of such MidSouth Equity Awards. No bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any
matters on which shareholders of MidSouth may vote are issued and outstanding.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule, as
of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt
securities of MidSouth are issued or outstanding. Other than MidSouth Equity
Awards, in each case, issued prior to the date of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements
obligating MidSouth to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, any such securities. There are no voting trusts, shareholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect pursuant to which MidSouth
or any of the MidSouth Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation with
respect to the voting or transfer of the MidSouth Common Stock or other
equity interests of MidSouth, other than the Support Agreements.

its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

(c) MidSouth owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the MidSouth Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to MidSouth
Subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, as provided under 12
U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No MidSouth Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding

timely basis.

3.5 _Reports_.

 

(a) MidSouth and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished,
as applicable, all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2016 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, (v) the OCC, (vi) any foreign regulatory authority and (vii) any SRO
((i)  (vii), collectively, " _Regulatory Agencies_ "), including any report,
registration or statement required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable)
pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state,
any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth. Except for examinations
of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the
ordinary course of business and except as set forth in Section 3.5(a) of the
MidSouth Disclosure Schedule, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has
pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of MidSouth, investigation into
the business or operations of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries since
January 1, 2016, except where such proceedings or investigation would not
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth. There is no unresolved violation
identified by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement
relating to any examinations or inspections of MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2016 (the " _MidSouth Reports_ ")
is publicly available. No such MidSouth Report, at the time filed, furnished
or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all MidSouth Reports filed or furnished under the

 



-14- 

    

 Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of MidSouth
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the MidSouth Reports.

3.6 _Financial Statements_. 

(a) The financial statements of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the MidSouth Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries in all material
respects, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and
consolidated financial position of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set
forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit
adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries have been, since January 1,
2016, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Porter
Keadle Moore, LLC has not resigned (or informed MidSouth that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of MidSouth as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with MidSouth on a matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth, neither MidSouth
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of MidSouth included in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (including any
notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2018, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of MidSouth and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of MidSouth or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth. MidSouth (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to MidSouth, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief

 



-15- 

    

 executive officer and the chief financial officer of MidSouth by others
within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to MidSouths outside auditors
and the audit committee of MidSouths Board of Directors (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect MidSouths
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of MidSouth, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
MidSouths internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to MidSouths outside auditors and audit
committee and a copy has been previously made available to Hancock Whitney. To
the knowledge of MidSouth, there is no reason to believe that MidSouths
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.6(d) of the MidSouth Disclosure
Schedule, since January 1, 2016, (i) neither MidSouth nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of MidSouth, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries,
has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of MidSouth, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss
reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that MidSouth or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by MidSouth or any of its officers,
directors or employees to the Board of Directors of MidSouth or any committee
thereof or, to the knowledge of MidSouth, to any director or officer of
MidSouth.

3.7 _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Neither MidSouth nor any MidSouth Subsidiary
nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or
related transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than Sandler
ONeill + Partners, L.P. pursuant to a letter agreement, a true and complete
copy of which has been previously provided to Hancock Whitney.

 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2018, no event or events have occurred that have had
or would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth.

 



-16- 

    

(b) Since December 31, 2018, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, MidSouth
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course.

 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(a) of the MidSouth Disclosure
Schedule, neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of MidSouth, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature (a " _Claim_ ") against MidSouth
or any of its Subsidiaries (i) that would reasonably be likely to be, either
individually or in the aggregate, material to MidSouth and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) of a material nature challenging the validity or
propriety of this Agreement.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.5(a) of the MidSouth Disclosure
Schedule, there is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or
regulatory restriction (an " _Order_ ") imposed upon MidSouth, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries (or that,
upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to the Surviving Company or any
of its affiliates).

 

(c) Section 3.9(c) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
the date hereof, a true, correct and complete list of each Claim or Order
that (i) resulted in any criminal sanctions to MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) within the last three years resulted in any settlement or
Order requiring payments in excess of $25,000, in each case by or against
MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries or, in their capacity as such, any of
their respective officers or directors, or (iii) within the last three (3)
years, imposed any injunctive relief with respect to, or that has required
the MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries to alter in any material respect, its
business practices.

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

(a) Each of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of MidSouth and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party.
Neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in
effect. The federal income Tax Returns of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries for
all years up to and including December 31, 2015 have been examined by the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or are Tax Returns with respect to
which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving
effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a
material amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted

 



-17- 

    

 or assessed against MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
pending or threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations or
other proceedings regarding any material Taxes of MidSouth and its
Subsidiaries or the assets of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries. In the last six
(6) years, neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in
writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that MidSouth or
any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not
filed. MidSouth has made available to Hancock Whitney true, correct, and
complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or
gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in
the last six (6) years. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes
not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among MidSouth and its Subsidiaries). Neither MidSouth nor any of its
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was MidSouth) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither MidSouth nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as
part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither
MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five years has MidSouth been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to include any material item of income in, or to exclude any material
item of deduction from, taxable income in any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in
method of accounting, (ii) closing agreement, (iii) intercompany transaction
or excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, or (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date,
in the case of (i), (iii), (iv) and (v), outside of the ordinary course of
business.

3.11 _Employees_ ___and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule lists all material
MidSouth Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _MidSouth Benefit
Plans_ " means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")),
whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, cash or equity incentive,
stock purchase, deferred compensation, welfare, retiree welfare, supplemental
retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements or other contracts or agreements
with respect to which MidSouth or any Subsidiary is a party or has any
liability or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by MidSouth
or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer, director or independent contractor of MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) MidSouth has heretofore made available to Hancock Whitney true and
complete copies of each of the material MidSouth Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto (or, in the case of a MidSouth Benefit Plan that is not in
writing, a summary of the terms thereof) and the following related documents,
to the extent applicable: (i) all current summary plan descriptions,
amendments, modifications or material supplements, (ii) the annual report
(Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") for the
last two (2) plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS determination
letter, (iv) the most recently prepared actuarial report or financial
statement (if applicable) for each of the last two (2) plan years, (v) all
material correspondence with a Governmental Entity received or sent in the
last six (6) years and (vi) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts
or documents of any other funding arrangements.

 

(c) Each MidSouth Benefit Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither
MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken in the last six (6) years any
corrective action or made any filing under any voluntary correction program
of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to any MidSouth Benefit Plan, and, to the knowledge of MidSouth, there is no
outstanding plan defect that requires correction under any such program.

 

(d) Section 3.11(d)(i) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule identifies each
MidSouth Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code (the " _MidSouth Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter or opinion, including to the extent applicable
regarding Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code, with respect to each MidSouth
Qualified Plan and its related trust, and neither MidSouth nor any of its
Subsidiaries have received any notice that such letter or opinion has been
revoked (nor, to the knowledge of MidSouth, has revocation been threatened),
and, to the knowledge of MidSouth, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred that in either case would have a material adverse effect
on the qualified status of any MidSouth Qualified Plan or the related trust
or increase the costs relating thereto. The MidSouth Employee Stock Ownership
Plan and Trust (the " _ESOP_ ") is intended to be an "employee stock ownership
plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Section
3.11(d)(ii) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule identifies (x) each
outstanding loan under which the ESOP is a borrower (each, an " _ESOP Loan_
"), (y) the lender and guarantor (if any) of each ESOP Loan, and (z) the
securities of MidSouth that were

 



-19- 

    

 acquired with such ESOP Loan (the " _Employer Securities_ "). Each ESOP Loan
meets the requirements of Section 4975(d)(3) of the Code. The Employer
Securities are pledged as collateral for the ESOP Loan with which they were
acquired, except to the extent they have been released from such pledge and
allocated to the accounts of participants in the ESOP in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 54.4975-7 and 54.4975-11.

(e) To the knowledge of MidSouth, each MidSouth Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of
the Code) and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to, and not
otherwise exempt from, Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since January 1,
2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since
January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(f) None of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries nor any MidSouth ERISA Affiliate
has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to, or otherwise had any obligation with respect to,
(i) any plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 or 4971 of the Code or otherwise incurred liability under Title IV or
such sections of the Code, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or (iii) a plan that
has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), and none of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries nor any MidSouth
ERISA Affiliate has, at any time during the last six (6) years, incurred any
liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a
complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in full. For purposes of this
Agreement, MidSouth ERISA Affiliate means any trade or business, whether or
not incorporated, which would be required to be aggregated with MidSouth or
any of its Subsidiaries and treated as a "single employer" within the meaning
of Section 4001 of ERISA.

 

(g) Neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, or has any
obligation with respect to, any MidSouth Benefit Plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement welfare (including health, medical or life
insurance) benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code or other
applicable laws. MidSouth or an applicable MidSouth Subsidiary has reserved
the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all MidSouth Benefit Plans
providing post-employment or post-retirement welfare (including health,
medical or life insurance) benefits in accordance with its terms and to the
extent permitted by applicable laws.

(h) All contributions required to be made to any MidSouth Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and

(i) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of MidSouth,
threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary
course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and,
to the knowledge of MidSouth, no set of circumstances exists that may
reasonably be likely to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the MidSouth
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the MidSouth
Benefit Plans that in any such event could in any case reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the IRS, the Department of Labor,
any fiduciary which MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify or any participant in a MidSouth Benefit Plan. To the knowledge
of MidSouth, no MidSouth Benefit Plan is under audit or the subject of an

Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, nor is any
such audit or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of MidSouth,

related trusts, or MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries, or any fiduciary which
MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify to any
material tax or material penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 502 of ERISA.

(k) Except as set forth in this Agreement or _Section_ __ _ 3.11(k)_ of
the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, cause the
vesting, exercisability, funding, payment or delivery of, or increase in the
amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any current or
former employee, director or other individual service provider of MidSouth or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) result in any limitation on the right of
MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any MidSouth Benefit Plan or related trust that
existed prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash,
property or otherwise) by MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. MidSouth has made available to Hancock Whitney
preliminary copies of Section 280G calculations with respect to any
disqualified individual in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(k) of the MidSouth Disclosure
Schedule, neither MidSouth nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or

(n) There are no agreements with, or pending petitions for recognition of,
a labor union or association as the exclusive bargaining agent for any of the
employees of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries, and there are no
representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or, to the knowledge of MidSouth,
threatened to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or
any other Governmental Entity. There are no organizing activities, labor
strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, arbitrations, grievances or
other collective labor disputes, other than routine grievance matters, now
pending or, to the knowledge of MidSouth, threatened against MidSouth or any
of its Subsidiaries and there have not been any such labor strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts with respect to MidSouth or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time within the five (5) years preceding this Agreement.

bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental Entity relating to its
employment practices, and except as set forth in Section 3.11(n) of the
MidSouth Disclosure Schedule, there is no charge of discrimination in
employment or employment practices for any reason, including age, gender,
race, religion or other legally protected category, which has been filed
against MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries or that is now pending before the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Entity.
MidSouth and each of its Subsidiaries is, and in the five (5) years preceding
this Agreement has been, in material compliance with all applicable laws in
respect of employment and employment practices, including terms
and conditions of employment and wages and hours, employment discrimination,
employee classification, workers compensation, family and medical leave, the

employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and Tax
reporting and under MidSouth Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized.

Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2016, held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth, and to the knowledge of
MidSouth no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Except as set forth in
Section 3.12 of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule, MidSouth and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any law, statute, order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to MidSouth or any of its

violation under 12 U.S.C. § 1851 and the regulations promulgated by the
Federal Reserve Board and the OCC (together, " _Federal Banking Agencies_ ")
in connection therewith (the " _Volcker Rule_ "). Section 3.12 of the MidSouth

in good standing under the laws of the State of Mississippi and is a bank
holding company duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be

the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Hancock
Whitney is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
event, circumstance, development, change or effect that, individually or in
the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially impair,
the ability of Hancock Whitney to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. True and complete copies of the Hancock Whitney Articles
and the Hancock Whitney Bylaws, each as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Hancock Whitney to MidSouth.

") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership
or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Hancock Whitney
Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Hancock Whitney to pay dividends or distributions except, in the

depository institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance
Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or, to the

independent public accountants of Hancock Whitney as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Hancock Whitney on a matter of

or in the aggregate, a Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect, neither
Hancock Whitney nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Hancock Whitney,

report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of Hancock Whitney, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Hancock Whitneys internal controls over
financial reporting. To the knowledge of Hancock Whitney, there is no reason
to believe that Hancock Whitneys outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give

regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

likely to have a Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge
of Hancock Whitney, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Hancock Whitney

(a) Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall promptly prepare and file with the
SEC the Proxy Statement, and Hancock Whitney shall promptly prepare and file
with the SEC the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the S-4
effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and MidSouth shall thereafter mail or deliver
the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Hancock Whitney shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions

 



-44- 

    

 contemplated by this Agreement, and MidSouth shall furnish all information
concerning MidSouth and the holders of MidSouth Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of this
Agreement, Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices
and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.
Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall each use, and shall each cause
their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each
such Requisite Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. The
parties shall cooperate with each other in connection therewith (including the
furnishing of any information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments
that may be required to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals) and shall
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to the reasonable requests of
Governmental Entities for documents and information. Hancock Whitney and
MidSouth shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to MidSouth or Hancock Whitney, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each party will provide
the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating
thereto prior to filing, other than any portions of material filed in
connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other
proprietary information filed under a claim of confidentiality (except
any competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information of
MidSouth that is necessary for Hancock Whitney to prepare and file any
applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals). The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences; and _provided_ that each party shall promptly
advise the other party with respect to substantive matters that are addressed
in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity which the other
party does not attend or participate in, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity and applicable laws, regulations, guidelines or policies
imposed by any Governmental Entity or requested by a Governmental Entity.

 



-45- 

    

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Hancock
Whitney and MidSouth shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or materially delay the Closing, and
(ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Hancock Whitney,
MidSouth and their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Hancock Whitney or MidSouth to take, or agree to take, any actions specified
in this Section 6.1 that would reasonably be likely to have a material and
adverse effect on Hancock Whitney and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
giving effect to the Merger (measured on a scale relative to MidSouth and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ ").

 

(d) Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Hancock Whitney, MidSouth or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Hancock Whitney
and MidSouth agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, (ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the shareholders of
MidSouth and at the time of the MidSouth Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading,
and (iii) any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will, at the time each is filed, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. Each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth further agrees that if it
becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the
statements in the S-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform
the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or
the Proxy Statement.

 

(e) Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

 



-46- 

    

(f) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.1, MidSouth shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Hancock Whitney and its
Subsidiaries (including the furnishing of information and by making employees
available) as is reasonably requested by Hancock Whitney in order to
comply with the requirements of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
and Dodd Frank Act Stress Testing programs.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall
mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders, nonactions, clearances,
waivers or approvals (and the expiration or termination of all statutory
waiting periods in respect thereof) from (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the
FDIC and the MDBCF and (y) any other approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and
4.4 which are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or those the failure of
which to be obtained would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Company ( _provided_
that for purposes of the definition of Requisite Regulatory Approvals,
references to "MidSouth" in the definition of Material Adverse Effect shall
be deemed references to "the Surviving Company").

6.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Hancock
Whitney and MidSouth, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems,
and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during normal
business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal
business operations, each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with the other partys regular business
operations during any such access. Neither Hancock Whitney nor MidSouth nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Hancock Whitneys or MidSouths, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

(b) Each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall hold all information
furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys
Subsidiaries or representatives

 



-47- 

    

 pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated
December 5, 2018, between Hancock Whitney and MidSouth (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.3 _MidSouth Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) MidSouth shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the MidSouth
Articles and MidSouth Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _MidSouth Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite MidSouth Vote required in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to approve a merger agreement. The Board of Directors of MidSouth shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of MidSouth the
Requisite MidSouth Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement)
that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
MidSouth shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Hancock
Whitney to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating
to the Requisite MidSouth Vote. However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section
8.2, if the Board of Directors of MidSouth, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue
to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
shareholders, the Board of Directors of MidSouth may submit this Agreement to
its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Board of Directors of MidSouth may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
applicable law; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of MidSouth may not
take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Hancock Whitney at
least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving
rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such
action is taken by the Board of Directors of MidSouth in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the
identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any
amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other
event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board
of Directors of MidSouth takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by Hancock Whitney and after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to
recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section
6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3.

 



-48- 

    

(b) MidSouth shall adjourn or postpone the MidSouth Meeting, if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of MidSouth Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting MidSouth has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite MidSouth Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the MidSouth Meeting shall be
convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of MidSouth
at the MidSouth Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the approval of this
Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve MidSouth of such obligation.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1
of this Agreement, each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as
promptly as reasonably practicable, (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by MidSouth or Hancock Whitney or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Hancock Whitney shall cause the shares of
Hancock Whitney Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee_ _Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary thereof, Hancock Whitney shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, provide the employees of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as they
are employed following the Effective Time, with (i) annual base salary and
wages that are no less than the annual base salary or wages in effect for such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) incentive
compensation opportunities (including equity-based awards) and employee
benefits that are substantially comparable to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Hancock Whitney and its Subsidiaries (excluding any
frozen benefit plans of Hancock Whitney and its Subsidiaries or benefit plans
that exclusively provide benefits to grandfathered employees of Hancock
Whitney and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ that until such time as Hancock
Whitney fully integrates the Continuing Employees into its plans (which shall
occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time),
participation in the MidSouth Benefit Plans as in effect as of the Effective
Time shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standard, it being understood
that the Continuing Employees may commence participating in the plans of
Hancock Whitney on

 



-49- 

    

 different dates following the Effective Time with respect to different
benefit plans. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be
entitled to incentive compensation from Hancock Whitney or the Surviving
Company in respect of a period prior to the Effective Time, and Hancock
Whitney and the Surviving Company may proportionately reduce the incentive
compensation opportunities contemplated by the immediately preceding
sentence to account for the portion of any applicable performance period
elapsed as of the Effective Time. For a period beginning at the Effective Time
and continuing through the first anniversary thereof, notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, Hancock Whitney or its Subsidiaries shall provide severance to
each Continuing Employee of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the severance plan or policy of MidSouth and its
Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employees as of the date hereof
(as set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the MidSouth Disclosure Schedule).

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Hancock Whitney or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Hancock Whitney shall or
shall cause the Surviving Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to:
(i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous MidSouth Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such
employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments
or coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to becoming eligible to participate
in the New Plans under a MidSouth Benefit Plan that provides health care
benefits (including medical, dental and vision), to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous MidSouth Benefit Plan prior to becoming
eligible to participate in the New Plans, in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements
under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with
MidSouth and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous MidSouth
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would be reasonably
likely to result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service,
(B) for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or
eligibility for retiree welfare benefits, or (C) for purposes of any New Plan
that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

(c) If requested by Hancock Whitney in writing at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, MidSouth shall cause its Board of
Directors to adopt resolutions so that any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained
by MidSouth (the " _MidSouth 401(k) Plan_ ") shall be terminated effective as
of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Hancock Whitney requests that any
MidSouth 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by Hancock Whitney or one of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Hancock Whitney 401(k) Plan_ "). MidSouth and Hancock Whitney shall take any
and all actions as may be reasonably required, including amendments to the
MidSouth 401(k) Plan and/or Hancock Whitney 401(k) Plan to permit the
Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions to the Hancock Whitney 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash or notes (in the case of loans). MidSouth

 



-50- 

    

 shall provide Hancock Whitney with evidence that the MidSouth 401(k) Plan
has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this Section
6.6(c); _provided_ that no less than five (5) Business Days prior to amending
or terminating the MidSouth 401(k) Plan, MidSouth shall provide the form and
substance of any applicable resolutions, amendments or other documents to
Hancock Whitney for reasonable review and approval.

(d) If directed by Hancock Whitney in writing at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, MidSouth shall cause its Board of
Directors to adopt resolutions to terminate, effective as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and contingent upon the Closing, the MidSouth Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (the " _MidSouth ESOP_ "). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, and provided such action does not violate any
applicable provision of ERISA or the Code, in consideration for the
forgiveness in full of all indebtedness of the MidSouth ESOP under the
MidSouth ESOP Loan, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
shares of MidSouth Common Stock in the suspense account of the MidSouth ESOP
having a value equal to the amount of such indebtedness shall be cancelled
and shall not be considered outstanding for purposes of Section 1.5 of this
Agreement, and any remaining shares shall be released and allocated among
eligible MidSouth ESOP participants. For purposes of this Section 6.6(d), the
value of a share of MidSouth Common Stock shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of the MidSouth ESOP subject to applicable law and taking into
account the terms of this Agreement. MidSouth shall provide Hancock Whitney
with evidence that the MidSouth ESOP has been terminated in accordance with
this Section 6.6(d); _provided_ that no less than five (5) Business Days prior
to terminating the MidSouth ESOP, MidSouth shall provide the form and
substance of any applicable resolutions, amendments or other documents to
Hancock Whitney for reasonable review and approval.

(e) Subject to any limitations under applicable law, Hancock Whitney
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor the terms of all
MidSouth Benefit Plans, including without limitation the Annual Incentive
Compensation Plan for the 2019 plan year with respect to the period elapsed
through the Effective Time and all employment, change in control, severance
and similar individual agreements to which any of MidSouth and/or its
Subsidiaries, is a party, all as specified on Section 3.11(a) of the MidSouth
Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
6.6(e) shall prohibit Hancock Whitney or the Surviving Company from amending
or terminating the MidSouth Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
and transitioning the Continuing Employees to New Plans.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, director or
other service provider of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Company,
MidSouth, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Company, MidSouth, Hancock
Whitney or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, director or other service provider of MidSouth or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any MidSouth Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular MidSouth Benefit Plan,
New Plan or any other benefit 

 



-51- 

    

 or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, including any current or former employee, director or other
service provider of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Hancock Whitney and
the Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer
or employee of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of MidSouth or any
of its Subsidiaries under MidSouth Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting
in such capacity) (collectively, the " _MidSouth Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer,
employee or fiduciary of MidSouth or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters,
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
Hancock Whitney and the Surviving Company shall also advance expenses
as incurred by such MidSouth Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law; _provided_ that the MidSouth Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and
customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such MidSouth Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, Hancock Whitney shall cause the Surviving Company to
maintain in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by MidSouth ( _provided_ that Hancock Whitney may
substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the
present and former officers and directors of MidSouth or any of
its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Hancock Whitney shall not be obligated to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 200% of the aggregate
annual premium paid as of the date hereof by MidSouth for such insurance (the
" _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Premium Cap, then Hancock Whitney shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance that, in Hancock Whitneys good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, MidSouth, in consultation with, but
only upon the consent of Hancock Whitney, may (and at the request of Hancock
Whitney, MidSouth shall use commercially reasonable efforts to) obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under MidSouths
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not
exceed the Premium Cap.

 



-52- 

    

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
MidSouth Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
Hancock Whitney or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets
or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in
each case, Hancock Whitney will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Hancock Whitney will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent required by any agreement previously entered into by MidSouth in
connection with a merger, acquisition or other business combination, the
provisions of this Section 6.7 shall apply to directors, officers, employees
and fiduciaries of predecessor entities previously acquired by MidSouth or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Company, Hancock Whitney and MidSouth
under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as
to adversely affect any MidSouth Indemnified Party or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent
of the affected MidSouth Indemnified Party.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to
the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement
and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other party, at the
expense of the party who makes any such request.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall each promptly
advise the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it
(i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have, in the case of MidSouth, a
Material Adverse Effect on MidSouth, or, in the case of Hancock Whitney, a
Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect or (ii) which it believes would or
would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ that any failure to
give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall
not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of
any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Hancock
Whitney and MidSouth shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of Hancock Whitney Common Stock and MidSouth Common Stock
and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that holders of MidSouth Common Stock shall
not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter
with respect to their shares of MidSouth Common Stock and any shares of
Hancock Whitney Common Stock any such holder receives in respect thereof in
the Merger.

 



-53- 

    

6.11 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) MidSouth shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning, or (iii) provide
any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate
in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that, prior to the receipt of the Requisite MidSouth Vote, in the
event MidSouth receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and
its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, MidSouth shall have provided such information to Hancock Whitney, and
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with MidSouth. MidSouth will, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Hancock
Whitney with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. MidSouth will promptly (and
in any event within one (1) Business Day) advise Hancock Whitney following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof
(including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person
making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) advise Hancock Whitney of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal. MidSouth shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any existing confidentiality agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. During the term
of this Agreement, MidSouth shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not
to on its behalf, enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or
other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.11(a))
relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer or proposal relating to, or any third-party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of MidSouth and its
Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
MidSouth or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of MidSouth, (ii) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning more than 15% of any class of equity or
voting securities of MidSouth or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of
MidSouth, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business
combination,

 



-54- 

    

 reorganization involving MidSouth or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated
assets of MidSouth, except, in each case, any sale of whole loans and
securitizations in the ordinary course of business and any _bona fide_
internal reorganization.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent MidSouth or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally
required disclosure to MidSouths shareholders; _provided_ that such Rules
will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. MidSouth and Hancock Whitney shall each use
their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b)
to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required
by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity
(iii) communications that are substantially similar to communications
previously approved pursuant to this Section 6.12, (iv) communications
permitted by Section 6.3 or Section 6.11 or (v) an obligation pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, MidSouth and
Hancock Whitney agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance
approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the
extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that is not consistent
with prior public disclosures.

 

6.13 _Change of Method_. Hancock Whitney may at any time change the method
of effecting the Merger, and MidSouth agrees to enter into such amendments to
this Agreement as Hancock Whitney may reasonably request in order to give
effect to such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or
amendment shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (b) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of the Merger with respect to MidSouths shareholders or (c) be
reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the
receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially
delayed.

 

6.14 _Restructuring Efforts_. If MidSouth shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite MidSouth Vote at the duly convened MidSouth Meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any
material term of this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or (ii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to MidSouths
shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.14) to its shareholders
for approval or adoption.

6.15 _Takeover Statutes_. MidSouth shall not take any action that would
cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger,
or any of the other

 



-55- 

    

 transactions contemplated hereby, and MidSouth shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, MidSouth will grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.16 _Exemption from Liability Under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. MidSouth and
Hancock Whitney agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain those officers and directors of MidSouth subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _MidSouth Insiders_
"), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that MidSouth
Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of MidSouth Common Stock and MidSouth Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this Section 6.16. The Boards of Directors of Hancock
Whitney and of MidSouth, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly after the date of this Agreement, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of MidSouth Common Stock or MidSouth
Equity Awards and (ii) any acquisitions of Hancock Whitney Common
Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by any
MidSouth Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of Hancock Whitney or of the Surviving Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

 

6.17 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Hancock
Whitney or MidSouth, as applicable, threatened against Hancock Whitney,
MidSouth or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank
Merger Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Hancock Whitney, MidSouth, or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. MidSouth
shall give Hancock Whitney the opportunity to participate at its own expense
in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against MidSouth
and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Hancock
Whitneys prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

6.18 _Disposition of Troubled Assets_. MidSouth shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, advise Hancock Whitney of efforts intended to be taken to
work out (a) Loans of

 



-56- 

    

 MidSouth or its Subsidiaries that have an outstanding balance of $500,000 or
more and were classified by MidSouth as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned,"
"Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified,"
"Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words
of similar import or (b) other real estate owned (OREO) properties with fair
value in excess of $500,000.

6.19 _Transition_. Commencing following the date hereof, and in all cases
subject to applicable law, MidSouth shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, cooperate with Hancock Whitney and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the
integration of the parties and their respective businesses effective as of
the Closing Date or such later date as may be determined by Hancock Whitney.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through
the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day
operations and the continuous operation of MidSouth and its Subsidiaries in
the ordinary course of business, MidSouth shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the employees, officers and representatives of MidSouth and
its Subsidiaries to provide support, including support from outside
contractors and vendors, as well as data and records access, take reasonable
actions and assist Hancock Whitney in performing all tasks, including
conversion planning, equipment installation and training, the provision of
customer communications and notices (including joint communications and
notices relating to anticipated account changes, branch closures, or systems
conversion), causing senior officers of MidSouth and MidSouth Bank to meet
from time to time with senior officers of Hancock Whitney and Hancock Whitney
Bank as Hancock Whitney may reasonably request to review the financial and
operational affairs of MidSouth and MidSouth Bank (and MidSouth shall give
due consideration to Hancock Whitneys input on such matters), and other
matters reasonably required to result in a successful transition and
integration at the Closing or such later date as may be determined by Hancock
Whitney.

6.20 _Redemption of MidSouth Preferred Stock and Trust Preferred
Securities_.

(a) MidSouth shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use

Preferred Redemption_ ").

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, prior to and at
the Closing, MidSouth shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use

to the effective time for the Bank Merger, as required, one or more
supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other instruments and documentation

obligations in respect of its outstanding Trust Preferred Securities, as
applicable, guarantees, securities and other agreements to the extent required
by the terms of such Trust Preferred Securities.

6.21 _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Hancock Whitney, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the operations of MidSouth or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
MidSouth, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Hancock Whitney or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

of MidSouth set forth in (i) Section 3.2(a) and Section 3.8(a) (in each case
after giving effect to the lead in to Article III) shall be true and correct

correct as are _de minimis_ ) in each case as of the date of this Agreement
and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date, and (ii) Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.2(b), 3.2(c), 3.3(a) and 3.7 (in
each case after giving effect to the lead in to Article III) shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except

-59- 

    

 this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and warranties
speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of this
sentence, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and
correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and
without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties, has had or
would reasonably be likely to have (x) a Material Adverse Effect on

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion,
counsel may require and rely upon representations contained in certificates of
officers of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth, reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to such counsel.

Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak
as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b), 4.2(b), 4.3(a), and 4.7 (in

and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence, such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless
the failure or

 



-60- 

    

 failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect
set forth in such representations or warranties, has had or would reasonably
be likely to have a Hancock Whitney Material Adverse Effect. MidSouth shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of Hancock Whitney by an
authorized officer of Hancock Whitney to the foregoing effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Hancock Whitney_. Hancock Whitney
shall have performed in all material respects the obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and

Whitney by an authorized officer of Hancock Whitney to such effect.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of MidSouth:

(a) by mutual consent of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth in a written
instrument;

(b) by either Hancock Whitney or MidSouth if any Governmental Entity that
must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger
or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

(c) by either Hancock Whitney or MidSouth if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either Hancock Whitney or MidSouth ( _provided_ that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement

 



-61- 

    

 contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants
or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of MidSouth, in the case of a termination by Hancock
Whitney, or Hancock Whitney, in the case of a termination by MidSouth, which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with
all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section
7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the
Termination Date and forty-five (45) days following written notice to
MidSouth, in the case of a termination by Hancock Whitney, or Hancock Whitney,
in the case of a termination by MidSouth, or by its nature or timing cannot
be cured during such period; or

(e) by Hancock Whitney, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite
MidSouth Vote is obtained, MidSouth or the Board of Directors of MidSouth (A)
submits this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for
approval, or otherwise withdraws or adversely modifies (or discloses its
intention to withdraw or adversely modify) its recommendation as contemplated
by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its shareholders an Acquisition Proposal
other than the Merger, or (B) materially breaches its obligations under
Section 6.3 or Section 6.11; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 20%
or more of the outstanding shares of MidSouth Common Stock is commenced (other
than by Hancock Whitney or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors
of MidSouth recommends that the shareholders of MidSouth tender their shares
in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such
shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the
ten (10)-Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange
Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Hancock Whitney
or MidSouth as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Hancock Whitney, MidSouth, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 3.3(a),
3.7, 4.3(a), 4.7, 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Hancock Whitney nor MidSouth
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide _
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to a member of the Board of
Directors or senior management of MidSouth or shall have been made directly to
its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced a _bona
fide_  Acquisition Proposal with respect to

 



-62- 

    

 MidSouth and (A) (1) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Hancock Whitney or MidSouth pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite
MidSouth Vote having been obtained or (2) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by Hancock Whitney pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (B) prior to the
date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of such termination, MidSouth
enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as
that referred to above), then MidSouth shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Hancock Whitney, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $8,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that for purposes
of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "15%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Hancock Whitney
pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then MidSouth shall pay Hancock Whitney, by wire
transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of termination (and in any event, within three (3)
Business Days thereafter).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting
the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum
aggregate amount of fees payable by MidSouth under this Section 8.2 shall be
equal to the Termination Fee.

 

(d) Each of Hancock Whitney and MidSouth acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if MidSouth fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Hancock Whitney commences a suit which results in a
judgment against MidSouth for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof,
MidSouth shall pay the costs and expenses of Hancock Whitney (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if MidSouth fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2, then MidSouth shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for
the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.
The amounts payable by MidSouth pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or
willful and material breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Hancock
Whitney in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such
section.

representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Except as provided in Section 6.7, notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no consent, approval or
agreement of any third-party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or

Agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
