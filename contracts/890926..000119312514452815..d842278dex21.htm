(a) Seller is an insurance company duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Company
is an insurance company duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New York. The Transferred Subsidiary
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of South Carolina. Each of the
Transferred Companies has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease or otherwise hold the assets and properties owned, leased or otherwise
held by it and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where
the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Transferred Companies is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing (individually or in the
aggregate) would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the states or jurisdictions where the Company is
domiciled or, as of the date hereof, "commercially domiciled", in each case
for insurance regulatory purposes or where the Company is licensed as of the
date hereof.

 

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of
the charter and bylaws (or other organizational documents), each as amended
to the date hereof (collectively, the " _Organizational Documents_ "), of the
Transferred Companies.

SECTION 3.2.  _Capital Structure_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company as of the date hereof consists
of 100,000 shares of common stock, $150 par value per share (the " _Common
Stock_ ") and 4,000.08 shares of perpetual preferred stock, $1,000 par value
per whole share (the " _Preferred_

 



12   _Stock_ "). The issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company as of
the date hereof consists of 100,000 shares of Common Stock, which constitute
the Shares. The Shares represent all of the Equity Interests in the Company
that are issued and outstanding on the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no
shares of Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. The Shares were duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and are
not subject to, and were not issued in violation of, any preemptive rights.
None of the Shares was issued in violation of any Applicable Law. Seller is
the record and beneficial owner of all of the Shares, free and clear of all
pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Permitted Liens.

 

(b) The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Transferred
Subsidiary consists of 100 shares of common stock, without par value, and
such shares represent all of the Equity Interests in the Transferred
Subsidiary that are issued and outstanding on the date hereof. The Company is
the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens.

(c) There are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of any Transferred Company pursuant to the
Organizational Documents of the applicable Transferred Company or any
agreement to which Seller or the applicable Transferred Company is a party.

SECTION 3.3. _Subsidiaries_. Other than the Companys ownership of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiary,
the Transferred Companies do not own any shares of the capital stock of, or
other voting or equity interest in, any Person, except for Investment Assets
held in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

SECTION 3.4. _Authority_. Each Seller Party has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will
be a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The
execution and delivery by each Seller Party of the Transaction Agreements to
which it is or will be a party and the consummation by each Seller Party of
the transactions contemplated thereby have been and, with respect to the
Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered at Closing, will be, duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of such Seller Party.
Each of the Transaction Agreements to which a Seller Party is or will be a
party have been or, with respect to the Transaction Agreements to be executed
and delivered at the Closing, will be, duly executed and delivered by such
Seller Party and, assuming the Transaction Agreements constitute valid and
binding agreements of the other parties thereto, constitute, or upon execution
and delivery thereof will constitute, valid and binding obligations of such
Seller Party, enforceable against such Seller Party in accordance with their
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

SECTION 3.5. _Noncontravention; Consents_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.5
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements by each Seller Party that is or will be a party
thereto, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by
such Seller Party, do not and will not (a) conflict with any of the
provisions of the Organizational Documents of any of the Seller Parties or any
of the Transferred

 



13  Companies, (b) subject to the matters referred to in the next sentence,
conflict with, result in a breach of or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, give rise to a right of termination under, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any
property or asset of the Transferred Companies under, any Contract, or (c)
subject to the matters referred to in the next sentence, contravene any
Applicable Law, which, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration
or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to any Seller Party in connection with the execution and delivery of
the Transaction Agreements by the Seller Parties, or the consummation by the
Seller Parties of the transactions contemplated thereby, except for the
approvals, filings and notices set forth in Section 3.5 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and such other consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings or notices that if not obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

assets in the Statutory Statements comply in all material respects with all
Applicable Laws with respect to admitted assets. Except as set forth in

the Transferred Companies assets is permitted only in accordance with

Inc. and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not a level of
materiality applicable to a Transferred Company or the Transferred Companies,
taken as a whole.

SECTION 3.7. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Transferred Companies do not
have any liability, whether contingent, accrued or otherwise, that is required

any event or change having, or that would reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
from December 31, 2013 through the date hereof, the Transferred Companies have
not, except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
taken any action which action, if occurring during the period from the date

contracts relating thereto, or to the funding thereof, including, without

administration contracts, investment management agreements, subscription and
participation agreements and recordkeeping agreements, each as in effect on
the date hereof.

 

(b) No Company Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or
a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, and except as set forth on
Section 3.9(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan or
Seller Benefit Plan provides health or other welfare benefits to former
employees of the Transferred Companies other than health continuation
coverage pursuant to COBRA. None of the Company Benefit Plans or the Seller

meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA).

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan and Seller Benefit Plan has been maintained and
administered in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other Applicable Laws. Each Company
Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service or is the subject of a favorable opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service on the form of such Company Benefit Plan or
Seller Benefit Plan and the tax-exempt status of any trust which forms a part
of such plan under Section 501(a) of the Code, all amendments to any such plan
for which the remedial amendment period (within the meaning of Section 401(b)
of the Code and applicable regulations) has expired are covered by
a favorable IRS determination letter or opinion letter, to the Knowledge of
Seller no event has occurred which will or could reasonably be expected to
give rise to disqualification of any such plan under such sections or to a tax
under Section 511 of the Code, and no notice has been issued by any
governmental authority challenging the qualification of such plans. All
Company Benefit Plans and Seller Benefit Plans (pursuant to which any Company
Employee may be entitled to payment or benefits or pursuant to which any
Transferred Company may have any liability) which are subject to Section 409A
of the Code materially comply with Section 409A in form and have been
administered in good faith in accordance with their terms and Section 409A of
the Code.

(d) None of Seller, the Transferred Companies or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has or has had within the past five (5) years any liability or
contingent liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA.

 

(e) To the Knowledge of Seller, there have been no acts or omissions by
Seller, the Transferred Companies or any of their ERISA Affiliates which have
given rise to or may give rise to any material interest, fines, penalties,
taxes or related charges under Section 502 of ERISA or Chapters 43, 47, 68 or
100 of the Code for which the Transferred Companies would reasonably be
expected to be liable.

 



16 (f) Except as set forth on Section 3.9(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any due to any current or former director, officer or
employee of Seller, the Transferred Companies or any of their ERISA
Affiliates. None of the payments contemplated by the Company Benefit Plans or
Seller Benefit Plans would, in the aggregate, constitute excess parachute
payments (as defined in section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection
(b)(4) thereof)).

(g) Except as set forth on Section 3.9(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
none of the assets of any Company Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan are
invested in employer securities or employer real property.

 

(h) There are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for
benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller threatened, involving any
Company Benefit Plan, any tax-qualified Seller Benefit Plan or the assets
thereof and to the Knowledge of Seller, no facts exist which could give rise
to any such actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits).

 

(i) There has been no act or omission that would impair materially the ability
of Seller or the Transferred Companies to unilaterally amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan.

(j) As of the date of this Agreement, the Transferred Companies have no
liability or contingent liability with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
other than the Company Benefit Plans and Seller Benefit Plans. As of the

Seller Benefit Plans and the Transferred Companies shall not assume any
liability with respect to any Seller Benefit Plans.

Company Employee as of the date hereof. The Transferred Companies are in

demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened to be brought or
filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority. No Transferred Company is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or other Contract with any labor organization or other
representative of any Company Employees. There are no material strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, arbitrations or grievances, or other material
labor disputes, pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against or
involving any Company Employees or the Transferred Companies.

approvals, waivers and authorizations and the making of notices and filings
described in _Section 3.5_, the execution, delivery and performance by Seller
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will not result in any revocation, cancellation, suspension or
nonrenewal of any such Permit, in each case other than any such item (i) that
has been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such Governmental
Entity or (ii) that would not be reasonably expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to be materially adverse to the Transferred Companies, taken as a
whole.

thereof, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall govern the obligations of Buyer and its Representatives with respect to
all information of any type furnished or made available to them pursuant to

other third parties necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including those set

Buyer Disclosure Schedule); _provided_ , that Seller shall be responsible for
the costs (including any license or other fees and expenses) associated with
obtaining any such consents or waivers from such other third parties or the
replacement of the rights to which any such consents or waivers relate;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall only be responsible for such costs
until the earlier of the one year anniversary of the Closing Date and the
date on which the applicable right or license would have terminated in
accordance with its terms as in effect on the date hereof. In connection
therewith, each of Seller and Buyer shall make and shall each cause
its Affiliates to make, at its respective expense, all legally required
filings as promptly as practicable in order to facilitate prompt consummation

and shall cause their 

 



32  respective Affiliates to provide such information and communications to

contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, shall defend or contest in good
faith any Action by any third party (including any Governmental Entity),
whether judicial or administrative, challenging any of the Transaction
Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, or that could otherwise
prevent, impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to have vacated or reversed any stay or temporary
restraining order entered with respect to the transactions contemplated by
any of the Transaction Agreements by any Governmental Entity and shall consent
to and comply with any condition imposed by any Governmental Entity on its
grant of any such permit, order, consent, approval or authorization, other
than any Burdensome Condition (as defined below). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate (A) Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Transferred Companies
to agree to any limitation, requirement or condition that would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the ability of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) to conduct their respective businesses, taken as a whole, after
the Closing substantially in the manner as such businesses were conducted as
of the date hereof or (B) (i) Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide any
guarantee or incur any liability (other than pursuant to the Transaction
Agreements) with respect to the Transferred Companies after the Closing Date
or (ii) Seller to agree to any limitation, requirement or condition that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Seller or any of its Affiliates to
conduct their respective businesses, taken as a whole, after the Closing
substantially in the matter as such businesses were conducted as of the date
hereof (taking into account the sale of the Transferred Companies) (each of
the foregoing clauses (A), (B)(i) and (B)(ii), subject in each case to
_Section 5.4(b)_, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Subject to Applicable Laws
relating to the sharing of information, each of the parties shall provide to
the other party copies of all applications or other communications to
Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement in advance of the
filing or submission thereof. Buyer shall have responsibility for the filing
fees associated with its change of control application and Buyer and Seller
shall have responsibility for their other respective filing fees associated
with any other required filings; _provided_ that any filings fees related to
competition or antitrust filings shall be borne equally by each of Buyer and
Seller.

 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that no limitation, requirement or
condition listed in Section 5.4(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Burdensome Condition or be
taken into account in determining whether a Burdensome Condition has been
imposed.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.4(a)_, within 20 Business
Days after the date hereof (or, with respect to any necessary "Form E"
filings, 30 Business Days after the date hereof), Buyer shall file with all
applicable Insurance Regulators requests for approval of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, which requests shall include all
required exhibits. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from the date hereof
until the Closing, it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, include
any plan, proposal or intention: (i) of the 

 



33  Company to declare, or to request approval or authorization of, any
extraordinary dividend or (ii) relating to any merger, acquisition,
divestiture or other business combination or any other material transaction
involving a Transferred Company (other than (x) the Post-Closing Merger and,
pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_, the Alternate Post-Closing Merger, (y)
customary expense sharing arrangements among affiliates and (z) the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements), in each case in any
business plan filed with or any request, filing, submission, application or
other communication to or with any Insurance Regulator or any other Person

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that (i) an applicable Insurance Regulator informs Buyer or Seller
that it will not grant its approval to the transactions contemplated hereby
due to any fact or circumstance related to the Post-Closing Merger but such
Insurance Regulator would grant its approval if the Post-Closing Merger
was accomplished by merging Buyer with and into the Company with the Company
being the surviving corporation (the " _Alternate Post-Closing Merger_ ") and
(ii) the Alternate Post-Closing Merger would not reasonably be expected
to impair or jeopardize the approval of any other applicable Insurance
Regulator or Governmental Entity, then Buyer shall, upon the written request
of Seller, within 21 days of such written request, submit a new or amended
business plan or a new or amended request, filing, submission, application or
other communication to or with any Insurance Regulator or any other applicable
Governmental Entity, in each case reflecting the Alternate Post-Closing Merger
and abandoning the Post-Closing Merger. 

(e) Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, a
reasonable time prior to furnishing any written materials to any Insurance
Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, Buyer shall furnish Seller with a copy thereof, and Seller shall
have a reasonable opportunity to provide comments thereon, which comments
shall be considered by Buyer in good faith. Each party shall give to the
other party prompt written notice if it receives any notice or other
communication from any Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and, in the case of any such
notice or communication which is in writing, shall promptly furnish the other
party with a copy thereof. If any Insurance Regulator requires that a hearing
be held in connection with any such approval, each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange for such hearing to be held promptly after
the notice that such hearing is required has been received by such party. Each
party shall give to the other party reasonable prior written notice of the
time and place when any meetings, telephone calls or other conferences may be
held by it with any Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and the other party shall have the
right to have a representative or representatives attend or otherwise
participate in any such meeting, telephone call or other conference.

SECTION 5.5. _Public Announcements_. Each of Buyer and Seller, and their
respective Affiliates, shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including regarding its plans
relating to employees or other third parties or with respect to the funding or
operation of the businesses of the Transferred Companies) and shall not issue
any such press release or make

 



34  any such public statement with respect to such matters without the advance
approval of the other party following such consultation (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Applicable
Law or by the requirements of any securities exchange; _provided_ , that, in
the event that, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel, any party is
required by Applicable Law or the requirements of any securities exchange to
issue any such press release or make any public statement and it is not
feasible to obtain the advance approval of the other party hereto as required
by this _Section 5.5_, the party that issues such press release or makes
such statement shall provide the other party with notice and a copy of such
press release or statement as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ ,
_further_ , no such consent shall be required if the press release or other
public statement does not include information regarding the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements that has not already been publicly
disclosed in a manner not in violation of this _Section 5.5_.

 

SECTION 5.6. _Related Party Agreements_. Except as set forth in Section 5.6 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all of the intercompany arrangements between

immediately prior to the Closing, including by terminating each Transferred
Companys participation in all agreements between more than one of such
Transferred Companys Affiliates, on the one hand, and such Transferred
Company, on the other hand, and Seller shall cause all intercompany
balances between Seller and its respective Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies), on the one hand, and any Transferred Company, on the
other hand, to be paid in full and settled immediately prior to the Closing or

mark, acronym or logo based on or incorporating any of such names, trademarks
or service marks (collectively, the " _Seller Trademarks_ "), or any Internet

Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to Seller or as Seller may
direct. Prior to or at the Closing, Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall
enter into a royalty-free license agreement with the Company in the form

United States for 90 days following the Closing. Buyer shall, prior to the

35  identifying logos, trade dress, monograms, slogans, service marks, domain

with other words, symbols or other distinctive or non-distinctive elements and
(ii) Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that any and all rights of
the Transferred Companies to the Seller Trademarks, including any such rights
licensed to the Transferred Companies pursuant to any agreements or other

derivation, translation, adaptation, combination or variation of the Seller
Trademarks.

 

SECTION 5.8. _Further Assurances_. Seller and Buyer shall (a) execute and
deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and shall take, or shall cause to
be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required or requested by
any party to carry out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and

to examine, duplicate or repossess such books and records), Buyer shall
afford promptly to Seller and its Representatives access to the books,
records, officers, employees, auditors and other advisors of the Transferred
Companies, and provide information with respect to the Transferred Companies

preparation of such financial information), to the extent reasonably required
by Seller for any lawful business purpose, including litigation, disputes,
compliance, financial reporting (including financial audits of historical
information), loss reporting, regulatory, Tax and accounting matters, and
Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller and its Representatives to furnish
such books and records and information and make available such officers,
employees, auditors and other advisors of the Transferred Companies;
_provided_ , that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Buyer or the Transferred Companies. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, access to records relating to Taxes shall be governed
exclusively by _Section 8.3_. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Companies to, implement an internal process to ensure the deletion of all data

36   _Person_ ") to be indemnified, either under Applicable Law or the

nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall prohibit a party or any of its
Affiliates (including, as applicable, the Transferred Companies) from (x)
engaging in general solicitations not directed at any Persons or (y)
soliciting, employing or contracting for the services of any Person whose

periods specified in such notice (collectively, the " _Required Financial
Statements_ "). The Required Financial Statements (including the notes
thereto) shall present fairly in all material respects the financial position
and results of operations and cash flows of the Acquired Companies at the
dates or for the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods set forth therein
(except as otherwise indicated therein and, in the case of the Required
Unaudited Financial Statements, subject to the absence of footnote disclosures
and other presentation items not required in interim financial statements
under SEC Regulation S-X). The Required Financial Statements shall be prepared
from and in accordance with the books and records of the Acquired Companies.
The Required Audited Financial Statements shall be audited in a manner meeting
the requirements of GAAP and SEC Regulation S-X adopted under the Securities
Act and shall be suitable for inclusion in a Form 8-K filing with the SEC.
The Required Audited Financial Statements shall be accompanied by an opinion
of Sellers independent registered accounting firm containing no material
qualifications and identifying no material exceptions to GAAP and otherwise
be in form required under the rules and regulations of the SEC. If so
requested by Buyer, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
registered accounting firm auditing the Required Audited Financial Statements
(as applicable) to provide consent to Buyers use of audit reports in respect
of the Required Audited Financial Statements (as applicable) and to provide
"comfort letters" relating thereto as may be required in connection with any
filings with the SEC made by Buyer under the United States federal securities
laws. Buyer agrees promptly to reimburse Seller for all fees, costs and
expenses of Sellers independent accountants in connection with this 
_Section 5.14(b)_. Seller shall, and shall cause its officers and employees
to, provide reasonable assistance to Buyer in preparing pro forma financial
statements that reflect the effect of the acquisition by Buyer of the
Acquired Companies for such periods required by GAAP and SEC Regulation S-X.

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Company to timely file its statutory financial statements with Insurance
Regulators, and such statutory financial statements shall be prepared in all
material respects in accordance with SAP and shall fairly present, in all
material respects in accordance therewith, the admitted assets, liabilities
and capital and surplus of the Company at their respective dates and the
results of operations, changes in surplus and cash flows of the Company at and
for the periods indicated, subject, in the case of the quarterly financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of

 



40  full footnote disclosures and other presentation items. Seller shall, or
shall cause the Company to, deliver to Buyer a copy of all such statutory
financial statements within three Business Days of the filing thereof.

SECTION 5.15. _Notice of Developments_. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon
obtaining knowledge of any matter that would be reasonably expected to result
in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ ; _provided_
, _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
5.15_ shall not be deemed to amend or modify this Agreement or the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to provide any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.15_ shall not result in a failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ or liability to any party hereto under
_Article VII_ unless the underlying event or breach would independently
result in the failure of any such condition or such liability.

SECTION 5.16. _No Solicitations_.

 

(a) During the period from the date hereof through the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article IX_, Seller shall not,
and shall instruct its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)

with any third party (other than Buyer, its Affiliates and its and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives), either as the proposed surviving,
merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any assets of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (other than in the Ordinary

capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company other than the

_Acquisition Transaction_ "), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of
an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished to any
Person (other than Buyer, its Affiliates and its and their respective

operations, properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction or (iv) otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person (other than Buyer, its
Affiliates and its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives) to do
or seek any of the foregoing.

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Buyer, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction.

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 7.1.  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire on the
eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that (i) the
representations and warranties made in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.4_ and 
_3.21_ (collectively " _Seller Fundamental Representations_ ") and _Sections
4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.5_ and _4.8_ (collectively " _Buyer Fundamental
Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely and (ii) the representations
and warranties made in _Sections 3.9_ and _3.10_ shall survive until 60 days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Any claim for
indemnification in respect of any representation or warranty that is not
asserted by notice given as required herein prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified in this _Section 7.1(a)_ shall not be
valid and any right to indemnification is hereby irrevocably waived after the
expiration of such period of survival. Any claim properly made for an
Indemnifiable Loss in respect of a breach of any such representation or
warranty asserted within such period of survival as herein provided will be
timely made for purposes hereof, in which case the survival period with
respect to the applicable representation or warranty shall be extended solely
for purposes of such claim until such claim is finally and fully resolved.

 



43 (b) To the extent that it is to be performed after the Closing, each covenant
in this Agreement will, for purposes of this _Article VII_, survive and
remain in effect in accordance with its terms plus a period of six months
thereafter, after which no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may
be brought hereunder. All covenants in this Agreement that by their terms are
required to be fully performed prior to the Closing will, for purposes of this
_Article VII_ , survive the Closing until the eighteen month anniversary of
the Closing Date, after which no claim for indemnification with respect
thereto may be brought hereunder. If a claim for indemnification is submitted
with respect to any covenant within the applicable period of survival as set
forth in this _Section 7.1(b)_, the survival period with respect to such
covenant shall be extended solely for purposes of such claim until such claim
is finally and fully resolved.

SECTION 7.2. _Indemnification_.

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and each of
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses paid, incurred or suffered by such Buyer
Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent specifically
made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) of any
representation or warranty of Seller made in this Agreement (other than any
representation or warranty in  _Section 3.10_) or in any certificate
delivered by Seller in connection herewith;

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller
under this Agreement;

(iii) (x) the matter set forth in Section 7.2(a)(iii)(x) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and (y) the matter set forth in Section 7.2(a)(iii)(y) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
the immediately preceding clause (y), Seller shall not be obligated to
indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Person in respect of any
Indemnifiable Losses other than Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses; and

 

(iv) any claims in relation to any Seller Benefit Plan except for the payments
that Buyer has agreed to make to any Buyer Transferred Employee as listed on
Section 5.12(c) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and each
of its and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses paid, incurred or suffered by such Seller
Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date) of any representation or warranty
of Buyer made in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Seller in
connection herewith;

 



44 (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer
under this Agreement; and

(iii) any claims brought by any Seller Transferred Employee who is terminated
at or prior to the Closing by Seller as a result of the selection of such
Seller Transferred Employee by Buyer for inclusion on Section 5.12(a) of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation or warranty as well as the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses
under this _Article VII_ , each representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement (other than _Section 3.13(a) _and the first sentence of _Section
3.8_) shall be read without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier contained therein.

SECTION 7.3. _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) No party shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless its respective
Indemnitees under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (in the case of Seller) or _Section
7.2(b)(i)_ (in the case of Buyer) (i) with respect to any claim, unless such
claim involves Indemnifiable Losses in excess of $120,000 (the " _De Minimis
Amount_ ") (nor shall any claim that does not exceed the De Minimis Amount be
applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible under clause (ii)
below) and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable
Losses of the Indemnitees under such _Section 7.2(a)(i) _or such _Section
7.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, exceeds $12,150,000 for all Indemnifiable
Losses (the " _Deductible_ "), at which point such Indemnitor shall be liable
to its respective Indemnitees for the value of the Indemnitees claims under
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or such _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, that is
in excess of the Deductible, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article VII_. The maximum aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer on the other hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all
Indemnifiable Losses under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_, in the case of Seller, or
_Section 7.2(b)(i)_, in the case of Buyer, shall be $81,000,000; _provided_ ,
that the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to all Buyer Indemnified
Persons for any and all Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement shall not
exceed the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in
the previous sentences of this _Section 7.3(a)_ (other than the limitation in
the immediately preceding proviso) shall not be applicable to any
Indemnifiable Losses asserted in respect of the Seller Fundamental
Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations. The maximum
aggregate liability of Seller to any Buyer Indemnified Person for any and all
Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses under _Section 7.2(a)(iii)(y) _shall be
$1,000,000. The limitations in this _Section 7.3_ shall not apply to claims
made under _Article VIII_.

 

(b) If any Buyer Indemnified Person actually realizes a Tax benefit in respect
of an Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 7.4(iii)_, any indemnification
provided under _Article VIII_ or subsequent to an

 



45  Indemnity Payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with respect to
such Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the
Indemnitor the amount of such Tax benefit realized by such Buyer Indemnified
Person up to the amount of such Indemnity Payment received by the Indemnitee,
net of any expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Person in pursuing such
Tax benefit, within 15 days after the Buyer Indemnified Person realizes such
Tax benefit in the form of cash actually received or reduction in cash Taxes
actually paid. If any Tax benefit (or portion thereof) in respect of an
Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition
of "Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 7.4(iii)_ or under _Article
VIII_ , that either (i) reduces the Indemnity Payments made by an Indemnitor
prior to the time such payment is made or (ii) obligates an Indemnitee to
make payments to the Indemnitor under the immediately preceding sentence of
this _Section 7.3(b)_, is disallowed as a result of an audit or otherwise,
the applicable Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the applicable Indemnitee the
amount of such disallowed Tax benefit within 30 days after the Indemnitee
notifies the Indemnitor that the adjustment with respect to such disallowance
has been paid or otherwise taken into account. Except as provided in 
_Section 7.1(a)_ or this _Section 7.3(b)_, the provisions of _Article VII_
shall not be applicable to any Tax matters, it being understood that all
indemnification obligations of Seller and Buyer with respect to all
Tax matters are set forth in _Article VIII_.

(c) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum
amount recoverable with respect thereto under any insurance or reinsurance
coverage or other applicable source of recovery (it being understood that no
Indemnity Payment to be made hereunder may be withheld due to the fact that
any such mitigation efforts have not been successful if such Indemnitee has
complied with its obligations under this  _Section 7.3(c)_).

SECTION 7.4. _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Indemnitee_ " means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

 

(ii) " _Indemnitor_ " means any Person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement;

 

(iii) " _Indemnifiable Losses_ " means any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses); _provided_ , that any Indemnity Payment (x) shall in no
event include any amounts constituting (A) punitive damages or consequential
damages (in either case except to the extent awarded to a third party and
actually paid to such third party in connection with a Third Party Claim) and
(B) damages for lost profits and (y) shall be net of any (A) amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnitee for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such
Indemnity Payment is made under any insurance policy, reinsurance agreement,
warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person other than a party hereto
or its Affiliates (net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in pursuing
such recovery), and the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for
any such amount that is

 



46  actually received by it from any such other Person with respect to an
Indemnifiable Losses after any indemnification with respect thereto has
actually been paid pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) as determined pursuant
to _Section 7.3(b)_, Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnitee (or, in
the case of a Buyer Indemnified Person, any other Buyer Indemnified Person) in
respect of any Indemnifiable Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is made
(it being understood that no Indemnity Payment to be made hereunder may be
withheld or otherwise delayed due to the fact that an anticipated Tax benefit
has not actually been realized by the applicable Indemnitee);

 

(iv) " _Indemnity Payment_ " means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required
to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

(v) " _Third Party Claim_ " means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made
or brought by any Person that is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate thereof.

SECTION 7.5. _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than 30 calendar days after becoming aware) thereof and such
notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim and any documents
relating to the claim and an estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall
reference the specific sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such
claim; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying
any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder
unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced
by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee failed to give
such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor,
within five calendar days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee
relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not (as long as it
conducts such defense) be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee shall
have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party

 



47  Claim, all of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to
the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees and directors available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnitor shall have assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors prior written consent. If the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may
only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim with the
Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the Indemnitor may pay,
settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i) includes a release of the
Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does
not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy
and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to
the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement offer that satisfies the requirements
set forth in the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence and the
Indemnitee refuses to consent to such settlement, then thereafter the
Indemnitors liability to the Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitors portion of the settlement amount
included in such settlement offer, and the Indemnitee shall either assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim or pay the Indemnitors attorneys fees and
other out-of-pocket costs incurred thereafter in continuing the defense
of such Third Party Claim.

SECTION 7.6. _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account
of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will
be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee.

SECTION 7.7. _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except as set forth in _Section 10.7(b)_, if the Closing occurs, their sole
and exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than any cause of action arising from actual fraud shall be pursuant to
the provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ or _Article VIII_ , as
applicable.

 

SECTION 7.8. _Certain Other Matters_. Upon making any Indemnity Payment,
Indemnitor will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated (on a
non-recourse basis and without any representation or warranty by the
Indemnitee) to all rights of Indemnitee against any third Person (other than
any Tax authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity
Payment related. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other
provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
above-described subrogation rights. Any payment received in respect of such
rights shall be distributed, first, to the Indemnitor in an aggregate amount
equal to the Indemnity Payments actually made by the Indemnitor to the
Indemnitee in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and, second, the balance, if
any, to the Indemnitee.

 



48 SECTION 7.9. _No Contribution_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have
any right of contribution or other right or remedy against the Transferred
Companies with respect to any inaccuracy, breach or failure to timely perform,
as applicable, any of Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives and releases the Transferred
Companies from any such right or remedy.

SECTION 7.10. _Effect of Investigation_. No due diligence review, audit or
other investigation or inquiry undertaken or performed by or on behalf of any
party hereto shall limit, qualify, modify or amend the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the other party hereto or the
indemnities by such other party hereto contained in this
Agreement, irrespective of the knowledge and information received (or which
should have been received) therefrom by or on behalf of such party. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the representations and warranties
also operate as bargained for promises and risk allocation devices and that,
accordingly, any partys knowledge, and the waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to
indemnification or payment of Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this _Article
VII_ or _Article VIII_.

(ii) any Conveyance Taxes required to be borne by Buyer pursuant to _Section
8.4_.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
in the following manner:

(i) in the case of Taxes based on or measured by income, gain, or receipts, or
related to the actual or deemed sale or transfer of property, or which are
withholding Taxes, or are premium Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated based
on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date; and

 



50 (ii) in the case of Taxes calculated on a periodic basis, the portion of
such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
hereto agree that neither party will make a ratable allocation election under
Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law with respect to Straddle Periods. In accordance with Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-76 and any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law, any Tax
related to (i) an extraordinary transaction (not contemplated by this
Agreement to occur on the Closing Date) that occurs on the Closing Date after
the Closing, or (ii) any transaction effected by reason of a binding
commitment entered into by a Transferred Company prior to the Closing shall
be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

(d) Buyer hereby acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty
as to the existence or amount of any net operating loss carryforwards of the
Transferred Companies to the extent that the Transferred Companies were
compensated for such net operating loss carryforwards prior to the Closing
Date under the Radian Group Inc. Allocation of Consolidated Tax Liability
Agreement.

SECTION 8.2. _Filing of Tax Returns_. 

(a) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Consolidated Returns that include the Transferred Companies,
regardless of when such Tax Returns are required to be filed.

(b) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns (other than Tax Returns described in _Section 8.2(a)_)
that are required to be filed by or on behalf of the Transferred Companies for
all taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date and that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into account any
extensions). Seller shall bear all costs associated with preparing and filing
such Tax Returns and the Tax Returns described in _Section 8.2(a)_. Seller
shall remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due with respect to such tax
returns. Seller shall prepare all such Tax Returns in accordance with past
practices, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or consented to in
writing by Buyer.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to
provide Seller and its Affiliates in a timely fashion in accordance with past
practice any filing information relating to the Transferred Companies
reasonably requested by Seller and necessary for the preparation and filing of
the Consolidated Returns.

 



51 (d) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or on behalf of the
Transferred Companies for any Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the positions taken, and with accounting
methods used, on the Tax Returns filed by or with respect to the Transferred
Companies prior to the date on which the Closing occurs, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law or agreed by Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall deliver
any such Tax Return to Seller for Sellers review at least 30 days (or, in
the case of premium tax returns, 10 days) prior to the date such Tax Return is
required to be filed (including extensions) unless such due date is within 45
days following the Closing Date, in which case such Tax Return shall
be submitted as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date. Seller
shall have the right to review each such Tax Return prior to the filing
thereof and to approve the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of each such Tax
Return, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall make any
changes requested in writing by Seller in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period of any such Tax Returns. To the extent consistent with Applicable Law,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred Companies to, file all Tax
Returns for any Straddle Period on the basis that the relevant Tax period
ended as of the Closing Date, unless the relevant Tax authority will not
accept a Tax Return filed on that basis. Buyer shall provide to Seller a
statement setting forth Buyers calculation of the allocation of liability for
Taxes shown on such returns between the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)_ not later than 30 days
prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax Returns (or,
if such due date is within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date). Such statement shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the preparation of the relevant Tax Return and shall be
accompanied by such supporting detail as is reasonably available to permit
Seller to determine whether it agrees with the amounts shown on such
statement. Seller shall have the right to review the allocation statement and
to review all workpapers and procedures used to prepare such statement. If
Seller objects to the allocation statement prepared by Buyer within 10 days
of receipt thereof, Seller and Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to resolve
such disagreement and, failing that, a neutral accounting firm mutually
selected by Seller and Buyer shall resolve the disagreement consistent with
the terms of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall share equally all costs
associated with preparing and filing such Tax Returns and allocation
statement. Without limiting the obligations of Seller under _Section
8.1(a)_, Seller shall pay Buyer or its designee in cleared funds no later than
three Business Days prior to the due date (including extensions) for such Tax
Returns an amount equal to all such Taxes that relate to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as shown on the allocation
statement, such amount to be determined in the manner set forth in _Section
8.1(c_).

 

(e) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Transferred Companies to
prepare and timely file, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to the Transferred Companies for any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date in such manner as it chooses in its sole discretion. Buyer shall
bear all costs associated with preparing and filing such Tax Returns. To the
extent that any such Tax Return includes Taxes for which Seller has
indemnified Buyer, Buyer shall provide Seller with a calculation of such
taxes, accompanied by

 



52  such supporting detail as is reasonably available to permit Seller to
determine whether it agrees with the amounts shown as due, not later than 30
days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax
Returns. Seller shall have the right to review the calculation and to review
all workpapers and procedures used to prepare such calculation. If Seller
objects to the calculation prepared by Buyer within 10 days of receipt
thereof, Seller and Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such
disagreement and, failing that, a neutral accounting firm mutually selected by
Seller and Buyer shall resolve the disagreement consistent with the terms of
this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall share equally all costs of the neutral
accounting firm. Buyer shall remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns (provided, that Seller shall pay Buyer or its
designee in cleared funds not later than three Business Days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for such Tax Returns the amount of any Taxes for
which Seller has indemnified Buyer).

 

(f) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, amend any Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies relating in
whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

SECTION 8.3. _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them or their respective Affiliates may reasonably
request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
Tax refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a Tax refund, or
participating in or conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation
and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities.
Each party and its Affiliates shall make its employees available on a basis
mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents
or information provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all
Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Transferred Companies for each Tax
period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until
the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax
period to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax periods, or (ii) three years following the due date (without
extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this _Section
8.3_ shall be kept confidential except as otherwise may be necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax refunds or in
conducting a contest or as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the
rules of any stock exchange.

(b) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
schedule (the " _Tax Attribute Schedule_ ") setting forth Sellers estimate of
the Tax Attributes of the Transferred Companies, along with supporting
documentation reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of the Tax
Attributes on such schedule (the " _Attribute Supporting Documentation_ ").
Seller shall deliver to Buyer an updated Tax Attribute Schedule and Attribute
Supporting Documentation at least quarterly. Within 30 days after filing the
U.S. federal consolidated income tax return for the consolidated group of
which Seller is a member for the

 



53  consolidated tax return year that includes the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a final Tax Attribute Schedule and Attribute Supporting
Documentation. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.3(b)_
shall require Seller to provide Buyer with its U.S. federal consolidated
income tax returns.

 

SECTION 8.4. _Conveyance Taxes_. Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall
execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the
other to comply with any filing requirements relating to any sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes ("
_Conveyance Taxes_ ") imposed on the sale or transfer of the Shares to Buyer
(but not, for the absence of doubt, any Taxes to the extent such Taxes would
not have been imposed but for the combined effect of such sale and any
internal restructuring by Seller) and shall file such applications and
documents as shall permit any Conveyance Taxes to be assessed and paid.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall share equally and be responsible for the timely payment of any
Conveyance Taxes.

SECTION 8.5. _Amended Returns; Tax Proceedings_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than Straddle Periods)_. (i) Seller shall
have the exclusive right to file or cause to be filed any amended Tax Returns
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) of
or with respect to a Transferred Company and (ii) Seller shall have the
exclusive right to control any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) of or with respect to a Transferred
Company (including a Consolidated Return that includes a Transferred Company);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with such Tax Proceeding that
relates to any Transferred Company (including a Consolidated Return that
includes a Transferred Company) and that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Tax Loss to Buyer and its Affiliates in a Post-Closing Tax Period,
Seller shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably apprised of the status of the Tax
Proceeding insofar as it relates to any Transferred Company and (ii) shall not
settle any such Tax Proceeding without Buyers consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) _Straddle Periods_. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the
other in determining whether to file or cause to be filed any amended Tax
Returns with respect to any Straddle Period of a Transferred Company. In the
event that Seller and Buyer cannot agree whether to file any amended Tax
Return for a Straddle Period, the parties shall estimate the present value of
the realizable Tax benefits of the amendment to the party proposing such
amendment and the present value of the realizable Tax Loss of the amendment to
the party withholding its consent to such amendment. If the parties are
unable to agree on the present value of such estimated amounts, they will
engage a neutral accounting firm to make such determinations. If the Tax
benefits exceed the present value of such estimated Tax Loss, the party
proposing such amendment shall be entitled to so amend the applicable Tax
Return, provided that such party agrees to pay to the party withholding its
consent an amount equal to the present value of any such Tax Loss. Buyer and
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with one another and shall control jointly
any Tax Proceeding that relates to a Transferred Company with respect to any
Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Tax Proceeding_ "). Each party shall (i)
collaborate with one another in good faith regarding any such Straddle Tax
Proceeding, (ii) provide the other

 



54  with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Straddle
Tax Proceeding and a copy of all documents (or portions thereof) relating to
such Straddle Tax Proceeding, and (iii) neither Seller or Buyer shall settle
any Tax claim with respect to a Straddle Tax Proceeding without the consent of
both Seller and Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) _Severable Post-Closing Tax Period Proceedings_. In the case of any Tax
Proceeding of a Transferred Company with respect to any Post-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Straddle Period), if the Tax Proceeding includes a claim
with respect to Tax for which Seller is liable under _Section 8.1(a)_, Seller
and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Tax
Proceeding to be bifurcated to allow all aspects of the Tax Proceeding
relating solely to Taxes for which Seller is responsible to be handled
separate from any other portion of the Tax Proceeding and separate from any
other Tax Proceeding. If the Tax authority agrees to do so, then Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control such portion of the Tax Proceeding insofar
as it relates solely Taxes for which Seller is responsible (the " _Excluded
Tax Proceeding_ ") and Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control the
remaining portion of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably apprised of the status of the Excluded Tax
Proceeding, (B) Seller shall consult with Buyer regarding any such Excluded
Tax Proceeding and (C) Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each stage of such Excluded Tax Proceeding and a copy of
all documents (or portions thereof) relating to such Excluded Tax Proceeding.

(d) _Non-Severable Post-Closing Tax Period Proceedings_. In the case of any
Tax Proceeding of a Transferred Company with respect to any Post-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Straddle Period), if the Tax Proceeding includes a claim
with respect to Taxes for which Seller is responsible and is not an Excluded
Tax Proceeding, then Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control all
aspects of the Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that (A) Buyer shall provide
Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax
Proceeding insofar as it relates to Taxes for which Seller is responsible and
a copy of all documents (or portions thereof or pro formas) relating to Taxes
for which Seller is responsible and (B) Buyer shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding insofar as it relates to Taxes for which
Seller is responsible without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that if Seller withholds consent to a
proposed settlement, then Seller shall be entitled to assume sole control
over the defense of the Tax Proceeding, at Sellers expense, and Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against any
Taxes in excess of the amount for which Buyer would have been liable under
the proposed settlement.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer shall have the
exclusive right to file any amended Tax Returns and to control any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any of the Transferred Companies in its sole
discretion.

 

(f) To the extent permissible under Applicable Law, neither Buyer nor any
Transferred Company shall carryback to a Pre-Closing Tax Period any item of
loss, deduction or credit or any net operating loss, net capital loss or other
tax credit or benefit that is attributable to, arises from or relates to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) commencing after the Closing

 



55  Date; _provided_ , _however,_ that if Buyer is required under Applicable Law
to carryback any such item and is not permitted by Applicable Law to waive
such carryback, and (i) if such carryback relates to a Seller Group Tax
Return, then Seller shall, reasonably and in good faith (taking into account
potential benefits and detriments to Seller and its Affiliates), consider any
request by Buyer to amend a Tax Return filed by or with respect to the
Transferred Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or take any
other action reasonably required) in order to claim a Tax refund or other
reimbursement attributable to such carryback and will pay to Buyer the
net Tax benefits actually received by Seller or any of its Affiliates that
are associated with such carryback (as determined taking into account (A) any
costs, including Taxes, attributable to the receipt of such refund or other
reimbursement and (B) the effect of such carryback on the Tax attributes of
Seller or its Affiliates and any limitations on use of those attributes) and
(ii) if such carryback does not relate to a Seller Group Tax Return, Seller
shall consent to the filing of an amended Tax Return or (or take any other
action reasonably required) in order to claim a Tax refund or other
reimbursement attributable to such carryback and will promptly pay to Buyer
the amount of any such refunds of Taxes (including any interest or penalty
rebate) actually received by Seller, the Transferred Companies or any of their
Affiliates that are associated with such carryback reduced by any costs,
including any Taxes, attributable to the receipt of such refund.

 

SECTION 8.6. _Refunds_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 8.5(f)_, Seller shall be entitled to any
refunds of, or credits against, any Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
any Conveyance Taxes that Seller has borne pursuant to _Section 8.5_ (and any
interest or penalty rebate with respect to such refund or credit but reduced
by any costs including any Tax incurred by Buyer or any Transferred Company
or any of their respective Affiliates as a result of the receipt of the refund
or credit), except to the extent such Tax refunds or credits relate to
Conveyance Taxes that Buyer has borne pursuant to _Section 8.5_. Upon the
reasonable written request of Seller, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) or other documents claiming
any refunds to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence
and shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller (except insofar as the
same are used by the Tax authority to reduce any Taxes for which Seller has
indemnified Buyer hereunder) any such refunds or credits (including
any interest or penalty rebate) actually received by Buyer or the Transferred
Companies, reduced by any costs, including any Taxes, attributable to the
receipt of such refund, and Seller shall be entitled to any such refunds
(including any interest or penalty rebate) actually received by Seller or any
of its Affiliates.

(b) Subject to _Section 8.5(f)_, and except as provided in _Section
8.6(a)_, Buyer shall be entitled to any refunds of and credits against any
Taxes (including any interest or penalty rebate) of the Transferred Companies,
reduced by any costs, including any Taxes, attributable to the receipt
of such refund.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Tax authority
subsequently disallows any item or refund with respect to which a party has
received a payment pursuant to the above provisions of _Section 8.5(f)_ or
this _Section 8.6_ from the other party, such recipient party shall promptly
pay (or cause to be paid) to the other party the full amount of such item or
refund (including any interest or penalty rebate) received by such party.

 



56 SECTION 8.7. _Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) Seller will file or cause to be filed a "Section 1.1502-36 Statement" (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(e)(5)) with the timely filed
U.S. federal consolidated income tax return for the consolidated group of
which Seller is a member for the consolidated tax return year that includes
the Closing Date making a valid election pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce the Tax basis in the Shares of the
Transferred Companies immediately prior to the Closing to the maximum extent
necessary to avoid a reduction in the Tax Attributes of the Transferred
Companies as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(4) and (5)
(the " _Section 1.1502-36 Election_ "). Seller further agrees to take all
other such actions (including, without limitation, as a result of future
adjustments to the Purchase Price) as may be required to give effect to the
Section 1.1502-36 Election and to prevent a reduction in the Tax Attributes of
the Transferred Companies. Seller will deliver a copy of the Section
1.1502-36 Statement to Buyer as soon as practicable following the filing of
Sellers U.S. federal consolidated Tax Return. Seller and its Affiliates will
not take any action that could be expected to result in a revocation of
the Section 1.1502-36 Election. In addition, Seller covenants that it will
not file an election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B)
or (C) to reattribute to itself any portion of the net operating loss
carryforwards or other tax attributes of, or otherwise attributable to, the
Transferred Companies.

(b) If, prior to the Closing, Seller wants to sell or otherwise liquidate the
assets of the Transferred Companies, for cash at prices not less than the fair
market value thereof (the " _Alternative Structure_ "), Seller shall: (i)
consult with and obtain the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, before
implementing the Alternative Structure, (ii) demonstrate to the satisfaction
of Buyer that the Alternative Structure will not affect the benefits, taken
as a whole, that Buyer would otherwise receive from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including in respect of the value of the
assets of the Transferred Companies), (iii) demonstrate to the satisfaction of
Buyer that the Alternative Structure shall comply with all applicable
regulatory requirements and shall not otherwise cause any closing condition
set forth in _Article VI_ to be incapable of being fulfilled (unless duly
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof) or result in any delay
in the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur, (iii) bear all costs
and expenses associated with the implementation of the Alternate Structure and
(iv) indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and
against, and reimburse each such Person for (together with all reasonable
fees, expenses and costs relating thereto), any Tax Loss in a Post-Closing Tax
Period attributable to the Alternative Structure, including a Tax Loss
resulting from a reduction in the Tax Attributes of the Transferred Companies,
without subjecting Buyer to any significant incremental credit risk. For the
avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances may Seller liquidate such assets
for non-cash consideration or at prices that are less than the fair market
value thereof without the prior written consent of Buyer (even if Buyer has
provided its consent to the Alternative Structure under clause (i) above).
Without limiting any of the foregoing requirements, if Buyer consents to the
Alternative Structure pursuant to clause (i) above, the parties shall execute
and deliver an agreement setting forth the terms of the Alternative Structure
before Seller proceeds with the implementation of the Alternative Structure.

 



57 SECTION 8.8. _Certain Post-Closing Taxes_.

 

(a) _Closing Date DTA True-Up_.

 

(i) Not later than the fifteenth Business Day following the end of the first
calendar quarter on or after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
an estimate (together with supporting documentation) of the total net deferred
tax assets of the Company as of the Closing Date, as calculated in accordance
with statutory accounting principles (i.e., SSAP 101), determined without
regard to valuation allowances or admissibility standards (the " _Estimated
DTA_ "). The Estimated DTA shall be estimated in good faith, consistent with
past practices, and based upon the books and records of the Company. Buyer
shall have the right to review the Estimated DTA along with supporting
documentation reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of the Estimated
DTA (the " _DTA Supporting Documentation_ "). Seller shall, on or before the
date that is not more than 30 days after the filing of Sellers final U.S.
consolidated federal income tax return that includes the Company for the
taxable year of the Company that ends on the Closing Date, deliver to Buyer a
calculation (together with DTA Supporting Documentation) of the total net
deferred tax assets of the Company as of the Closing Date taking into account
only such adjustments that are a direct result of amounts in the final tax
return that differ from the amounts used in calculating the Estimated DTA
(the " _Adjusted DTA_ "). Seller shall calculate the Adjusted DTA in the same
manner, using the same principles, as the calculation of the Estimated DTA;
provided, that changes to the Adjusted DTA resulting from (i) the change in a
statutory asset (whether or not admitted) or liability will be excluded from
the Adjusted DTA and (ii) a change in Tax law will not be included in the
Adjusted DTA.

 

(ii) If Buyer, within thirty business days after delivery of the Estimated DTA
or Adjusted DTA, as the case may be, and DTA Supporting Documentation,
notifies Seller in writing that it objects to the Estimated DTA or the
Adjusted DTA specifying in reasonable detail each item that Buyer disputes
(each, a " _Disputed Item_ "), both parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve the Disputed Items. If Seller and Buyer reach agreement with respect
to any Disputed Items, Seller shall revise the Estimated DTA or the Adjusted
DTA, as the case may be, to reflect such agreement. If they are unable to do
so, Buyer and Seller shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved Disputed
Items to an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing as
may be mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller (the " _Transaction Consultant_ ").
The determination of the Transaction Consultant shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon Buyer and Seller absent manifest error, and Seller shall
revise the Estimated DTA or Adjusted DTA, as applicable, to reflect such
determination upon receipt thereof. The fees, expenses and costs of the
Transaction Consultant shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 



58 (iii) In the event that Adjusted DTA is greater than the Estimated DTA,
Buyer shall, within 15 Business Days of the determination thereof, transfer
to Seller the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller. In the event that the
Estimated DTA is greater than the Adjusted DTA, Seller shall, within 15
Business Days of the determination thereof, transfer to Buyer the amount of
such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer. In addition, the Companys share of the U.S. federal
consolidated net operating loss for which the Company has been fully
compensated under the Radian Group Inc. Allocation of Consolidated Tax
Liability Agreement is specifically excluded from this Section 8.8(a).

 

(b) Without duplication for any payments made by Seller pursuant _Section
8.8(a)_ or _(c)_ , Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Persons from and against any action taken by Seller, or any
failure to take an action reasonably requested by Buyer, in each case after
the Closing Date, that results in a reduction to the Adjusted DTA. Seller
shall, within 15 Business Days of the determination of such reduction,
transfer to Buyer the amount of such reduction by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer.

 

(c) Without duplication for any payments made by Seller pursuant to _Section
8.8(a)_ or _(b)_ , Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Persons from and against any Tax Losses for any Post-Closing Tax
Period to the extent that such Tax Losses are directly attributable to (i)
filing an amended Tax Return described in _Section 8.5(a)(i)_, (ii)
resolving a Tax Proceeding described in _Section 8.5(a)(ii)_ or an Excluded
Tax Proceeding described in _Section 8.5(b)_, or (iii) a failure of Seller to
prepare Tax Returns in accordance with past practices without obtaining
Buyers prior written consent or demonstrating that such deviation was
required by Applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any
resulting Tax Loss no later than 15 Business Days after such Tax Loss is
considered to arise under _Section 8.8(d)_.

(d) Buyer shall be considered to realize a Tax Loss to the extent that the
amount of Taxes it is actually required to pay to the applicable Tax
authority is increased from the amount of Taxes it would have actually been
required to pay to such Tax authority (or the amount of a Tax refund it is
actually entitled to receive from the applicable Tax authority is decreased
from the amount of Tax refund it would actually have been entitled to receive)
in the absence of such Tax detriment. Such Tax Loss shall be considered to
arise at the time that such partys increased payment is first due or
otherwise actually realized as a change in the amount of Tax then due and
payable or such partys decreased receipt is first due or otherwise actually
realized as a change in the amount of refund then due and payable.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to indemnify
Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.8(b)_ for any reductions in the Adjusted DTA
that are directly attributable to a reduction in foreign tax credits or net
operating loss carryforwards that (A) were allocated to the Transferred
Companies and (B) for which the Transferred Companies have been
fully compensated prior to the Closing Date under the Radian Group Inc.
Allocation of Consolidated

 



59  Tax Liability Agreement. Seller hereby acknowledges that the Transferred
Companies have not been compensated under the Radian Group Inc. Allocation of
Consolidated Tax Liability Agreement for at least $11,000,000 of foreign tax
credits allocable to them as of the Closing Date.

SECTION 8.9. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat all payments (other than interest on a
payment) made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other or the
others Affiliates or the Transferred Companies under this _Article VIII_ and
under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof to the extent permissible under Applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Persons, as well as the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons, pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall
terminate on the later of three months after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable extensions or
tollings thereof) with respect to the Tax liabilities in question or 60 days
after the final administrative or judicial determination of such Tax
liabilities, except for any indemnity obligations as to which a claim has been
made before the expiration of the applicable period.

 

(c) In the event of any Tax Proceeding, the conduct of the parties shall be
governed by the provisions of _Section 8.5_.

 

(d) Except as provided for in _Section 7.3(b)_, indemnification under this
Agreement for or with respect to any Taxes shall be provided exclusively in
this _Article VIII_ and the provisions of _Article VII_ shall not apply.

(e) Seller shall terminate, or cause to be terminated, on or before the
Closing Date all Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreements or arrangements, if
any, relating to the Transferred Companies (other than this Agreement) and
none of the Transferred Companies will have any liability thereunder on or
after the Closing Date.

contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the
Code.

TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

 

SECTION 9.1. _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity that prohibits or restrains any party from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, injunction
or decree shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(a)_
shall have performed in all material respects its obligations under this
Agreement, acted in good faith and, if binding on such party, used
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of, and to remove,
such order, injunction or decree in accordance with its obligations under
this Agreement;

(b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or
prior to September 22, 2015 (as it may be extended, the " _Outside Date_ "),
unless the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a material breach
of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;
_provided_ , that if on the Outside Date either of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.1(b)_ has not been satisfied then, upon the
written notice of Seller to Buyer, the Outside Date shall be automatically
extended to a date and time that is not later than 5:00 pm, New York City
time, on December 22, 2015; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ will not be
available to any party if the other party has, in good faith, filed an Action
seeking, and is then pursuing, specific performance as permitted by _Section
10.7(b)_.

 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer (but only so long as Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement) in writing, if a breach of any provision of this Agreement
that has been committed by the other party would cause the failure of any
mutual condition to Closing or any condition to Closing for the benefit of the
non-breaching party and such breach is not subsequently waived by the non-
breaching party or capable of being cured or is not cured within 20 Business
Days after the breaching party receives written notice from the non-breaching
party that the non-breaching party intends to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_;

(d) by Seller in writing, if an applicable Insurance Regulator informs Buyer
or Seller that it will not grant its approval to the transactions contemplated
hereby due to any fact or circumstance related to the Post-Closing Merger and
either (i) Buyer has not, within 21 days after Sellers written request to
Buyer to do so, submitted a new or amended business plan or a new or amended
request, filing, submission, application or other communication to or with
such Insurance Regulator reflecting the Alternate Post-Closing Merger and
abandoning the Post-Closing Merger or (ii) either party has been informed by
an applicable Insurance Regulator that it will not grant its approval to the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Alternate Post-Closing Merger and,
during the 21-day period immediately following the date on which Seller
informs Buyer in writing of its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 9.1(d)_ (which notice shall name the applicable Insurance
Regulator), such Insurance Regulator has not informed Seller of its intention
to approve the transactions contemplated hereby and the Alternate Post-Closing
Merger;

 



61 (e) by Buyer in writing, if an applicable Insurance Regulator informs Buyer or
Seller that it will not grant its approval to the transactions contemplated
hereby due to any fact or circumstance related to the Post-Closing Merger and
either party has been informed by an applicable Insurance Regulator that it
will not grant its approval to the transactions contemplated hereby and the
Alternate Post-Closing Merger and, during the 51-day period immediately
following the date on which Buyer informs Seller in writing of its intent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(e)_ (which notice
shall name the applicable Insurance Regulator), such Insurance Regulator has
not informed Buyer of its intention to approve the transactions contemplated
hereby and the Alternate Post-Closing Merger; or

 

(f) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

 

SECTION 9.2. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect without liability of either party (or any
Representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_
, that no such termination shall relieve a party from liability for
any intentional breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
_Section 1.1_, _Section 5.5_, this _Section 9.2_ and _Article X_ shall
survive termination hereof pursuant to _Section 9.1_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, (a) Buyer shall return all documents
received from Seller, its Affiliates and its Representatives relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to Seller and (b) all confidential information received by

Companies, shall be responsible for the Transaction Expenses of Seller and its
Affiliates incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out the

thereby, in each case that are incurred prior to the Closing (whether payable
prior to, at or after the Closing).

SECTION 10.3. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or
an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
references herein to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation
are to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the
case of statutes, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under said
statutes) and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any
successor to said section. Any fact or item disclosed in any section of each
of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosed in all other sections of such Disclosure Schedule to the
extent the applicability of such fact or item to such other section of such
Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent. Disclosure of any item in the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule or the Seller Disclosure Schedule, as

 



63  the case may be, shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents
a material item, fact, exception of fact, event or circumstance or that
occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or effect related to such item
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the singular is used
herein, the same shall include the plural, and whenever the plural is used
herein, the same shall include the singular, where appropriate. Whenever the
word "Dollars" or the "$" sign appear in this Agreement, they shall be
construed to mean United States Dollars, and all transactions under this
Agreement shall be in United States Dollars. All time periods within or
following which any payment is to be made or act is to be done shall
be calculated by excluding the date on which the period commences and
including the date on which the period ends and by extending the period to the
first succeeding Business Day if the last day of the period is not a Business
Day. This Agreement has been fully negotiated by the parties hereto and shall
not be construed by any Governmental Entity against either party by virtue of
the fact that such party was the drafting party.

 

SECTION 10.4. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including all exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Except as set forth in (a) _Section 5.10_
with respect to the directors and officers referred to therein, (b) _Section
5.11_ with respect to Affiliates of Seller and (c) _Articles VII_ and _VIII_
with respect to the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified
Persons, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

 

SECTION 10.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising
hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

SECTION 10.6. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by
operation of law in a merger), by either party without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such assignment that is not consented to
shall be null and void; _provided_ , that Buyer may, without the prior written
consent of Seller, assign its rights to acquire the Shares to a wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment
shall limit, or relieve Buyer of, any of Buyers duties or obligations under
any of the Transaction Agreements. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



64 SECTION 10.7. _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City, State and County of New
York (each, a " _New York Court_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement
or determining any claim arising from or related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In any such action, suit or
other proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise
any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York
Court, that such action, suit or other proceeding is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such
action, suit or other proceeding is improper; _provided_ , that nothing set
forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the parties hereto from removing
any matter from one New York Court to another New York Court. Each of the
parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a
party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding will be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
will be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.
Any process or other paper to be served in connection with any action or
proceeding under this Agreement shall, if delivered or sent in accordance with
_Section 10.2_, constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, this being in
addition (subject to the terms of this Agreement) to any other remedy to which
such party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto
shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim,
that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.7_.

 



65 SECTION 10.8. _Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver_.

 

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

(b) This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by each
of Buyer and Seller. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

 

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 

SECTION 10.9. _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the other
Transaction Agreements, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of
the Schedules or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies), nor any Representative of any of them, makes or has made, and
Buyer has not relied on, any inducement or promise to Buyer except as
specifically made in this Agreement or any representation or warranty to
Buyer, oral or written, express or implied, other than as expressly set forth
in _Article III_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, other
than as expressly set forth in _Article III_ , no Person has made any
representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to the Transferred Companies,
the Shares or any other matter, including with respect to (i)
merchantability, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, (ii) the
operation of the Transferred Companies by Buyer after the Closing, (iii) the
probable success or profitability of the Transferred Companies after
the Closing or (iv) any information, documents or material made available to
Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in any "data rooms,"
information memoranda, management presentations, functional "break-
out" discussions or in any other form or forum in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any estimation,
valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast with respect to the Transferred
Companies.

 

(b) Seller makes no express or implied representation or warranty hereby or
otherwise under this Agreement as to the future experience, success or
profitability of the Transferred Companies businesses, whether or not
conducted in a manner similar to the manner in which such businesses were
conducted prior to the Closing, that the reserves held by or on behalf of
the Transferred Companies or the assets supporting such reserves have been or
will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes for which they were
established, that the reinsurance

 



66  recoverables taken into account in determining the amount of such reserves
will be collectible or whether such reserves were calculated, established or
determined in accordance with any actuarial, statutory or other standard, or
concerning any financial statement "line item" or asset, liability or equity
amount that would be affected by any of the foregoing.

 

SECTION 10.10. _No Offset_. No party to this Agreement may offset any amount
due to the other party hereto or any of such other partys Affiliates against
any amount owed or alleged to be owed from such other party or its Affiliates
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement without the written
consent of such other party.

 

SECTION 10.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart
of this Agreement to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any
other electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery
will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed
counterpart.

been committed by the other party would cause the failure of any mutual
condition to Closing or any condition to Closing for the benefit of the non-
breaching party and such breach is not subsequently waived by the non-
breaching party or capable of being cured or is not cured within 20 Business
Days after the breaching party receives written notice from the non-breaching
party that the non-breaching party intends to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_;

(d) by either Seller or Buyer if the SPA is terminated in accordance with its
terms; or

(e) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

 



13 SECTION 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to  _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect without liability of either party (or any
Representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_
, that no such termination shall relieve a party from liability for any
intentional breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section
1.1_, _Section 5.3_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article IX_ shall
survive termination hereof pursuant to _Section 7.1_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, (a) Buyer shall return all documents
received from Seller, its Affiliates and its Representatives relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to Seller and (b) all confidential information received by
Buyer with respect to the Company shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 8.1.  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire on the
eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that (i) the
representations and warranties made in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.4_ and 
_3.11_ (collectively " _Seller Fundamental Representations_ ") and _Sections
4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.4_ and _4.5_ (collectively " _Buyer Fundamental
Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely and (ii) the representations
and warranties made in _Sections 3.7_ and _3.10_ shall survive until 60 days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Any claim for
indemnification in respect of any representation or warranty that is not
asserted by notice given as required herein prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified in this _Section 8.1(a)_ shall not be
valid and any right to indemnification is hereby irrevocably waived after the
expiration of such period of survival. Any claim properly made for an
Indemnifiable Loss in respect of a breach of any such representation or
warranty asserted within such period of survival as herein provided will be
timely made for purposes hereof, in which case the survival period with
respect to the applicable representation or warranty shall be extended solely
for purposes of such claim until such claim is finally and fully resolved.

 

(b) To the extent that it is to be performed after the Closing, each covenant
in this Agreement will, for purposes of this _Article VIII_ , survive and
remain in effect in accordance with its terms plus a period of six months
thereafter, after which no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may
be brought hereunder. All covenants in this Agreement that by their terms are
required to be fully performed prior to the Closing will, for purposes of this
_Article VIII_ , survive the Closing until the eighteen month anniversary of
the Closing Date, after which no claim for indemnification with respect
thereto may be brought hereunder. If a claim for indemnification is submitted
with respect to any covenant within the applicable period of survival as set
forth in this _Section 8.1(b)_, the survival period with respect to such
covenant shall be extended solely for purposes of such claim until such claim
is finally and fully resolved.

 



14 SECTION 8.2. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and each of
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses paid, incurred or suffered by such Buyer
Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from or arising out of: 

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent specifically
made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) of any
representation or warranty of Seller made in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by Seller in connection herewith;

 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller under
this Agreement;

 

(iii) any Taxes of, imposed on or relating to the Company for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (for the avoidance of doubt this shall include any Taxes imposed
as result of the sale of the Units); _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to this _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_, Seller shall only be liable to the
Buyer Indemnified Persons for 50% of any such Indemnifiable Losses; and

(iv) any Taxes of Persons (other than the Company) for which the Company,
Buyer or any of their Affiliates are liable (A) by reason of the application
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 and any corresponding provision of
state, local, or foreign law or (B) that result from a failure by Seller to
properly withhold Taxes on payments with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to this _Section
8.2(a)(iv)_, Seller shall only be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
50% of any such Indemnifiable Losses. 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and each of
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses paid, incurred or suffered by such Seller
Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from or arising out of: 

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date) of any representation or warranty
of Buyer made in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Seller in
connection herewith; and

 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer under
this Agreement.

 

(c) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation or warranty as well as the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses
under this _Article VIII_ , each representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be read without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier contained therein.

 



15 SECTION 8.3. _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) No party shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless its respective
Indemnitees under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (in the case of Seller) or _Section
8.2(b)(i)_ (in the case of Buyer) (i) with respect to any claim, unless such
claim involves Indemnifiable Losses in excess of $25,000 (the " _De Minimis
Amount_ ") (nor shall any claim that does not exceed the De Minimis Amount be
applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible under clause (ii)
below) and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable
Losses of the Indemnitees under such _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or such _Section
8.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, exceeds $200,000 for all Indemnifiable Losses
(the " _Deductible_ "), at which point such Indemnitor shall be liable to its
respective Indemnitees for the value of the Indemnitees claims under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ or such _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, that is in excess
of the Deductible, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
VIII_. The maximum aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer
on the other hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all
Indemnifiable Losses under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, in the case of Seller, or
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_, in the case of Buyer, shall be $1,200,000; _provided_ ,
that the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to all Buyer Indemnified
Persons for any and all Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement (other than
under _Sections 8.2(a)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ ) shall not exceed $2,500,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in the previous sentences of
this _Section 8.3(a)_ (other than the limitation in the immediately
preceding proviso) shall not be applicable to any Indemnifiable Losses
asserted in respect of the Seller Fundamental Representations or the Buyer
Fundamental Representations.

 

(b) If any Buyer Indemnified Person actually realizes a Tax benefit in respect
of an Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 8.4(iii)_ or subsequent to an
Indemnity Payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor
the amount of such Tax benefit realized by such Buyer Indemnified Person up to
the amount of such Indemnity Payment received by the Indemnitee, net of any
expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Person in pursuing such
Tax benefit, within 15 days after the Buyer Indemnified Person realizes such
Tax benefit in the form of cash actually received or reduction in cash Taxes
actually paid. If any Tax benefit (or portion thereof) in respect of an
Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 8.4(iii)_, that either (i)
reduces the Indemnity Payments made by an Indemnitor prior to the time such
payment is made or (ii) obligates an Indemnitee to make payments to the
Indemnitor under the immediately preceding sentence of this

 



16   _Section 8.3(b)_, is disallowed as a result of an audit or otherwise, the
applicable Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the applicable Indemnitee the
amount of such disallowed Tax benefit within 30 days after the Indemnitee
notifies the Indemnitor that the adjustment with respect to such disallowance
has been paid or otherwise taken into account.

 

(c) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum
amount recoverable with respect thereto under any insurance or reinsurance
coverage or other applicable source of recovery (it being understood that no
Indemnity Payment to be made hereunder may be withheld due to the fact that
any such mitigation efforts have not been successful if such Indemnitee has
complied with its obligations under this _Section 8.3(c)_).

 

SECTION 8.4. _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Indemnitee_ " means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

 

(ii) " _Indemnitor_ " means any Person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement;

 

(iii) " _Indemnifiable Losses_ " means any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses); _provided_ , that any Indemnity Payment (x) shall in no
event include any amounts constituting (A) punitive damages or consequential
damages (in either case except to the extent awarded to a third party and
actually paid to such third party in connection with a Third Party Claim) and
(B) damages for lost profits and (y) shall be net of any (A) amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnitee for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such
Indemnity Payment is made under any insurance policy, reinsurance agreement,
warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person other than a party hereto
or its Affiliates (net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in pursuing
such recovery), and the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for
any such amount that is actually received by it from any such other Person
with respect to an Indemnifiable Losses after any indemnification with respect
thereto has actually been paid pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) as
determined pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, Tax benefits actually realized by
the Indemnitee (or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Person, any other Buyer
Indemnified Person) in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses for which such
Indemnity Payment is made (it being understood that no Indemnity Payment to be
made hereunder may be withheld or otherwise delayed due to the fact that an
anticipated Tax benefit has not actually been realized by the applicable
Indemnitee);

 



17 (iv) " _Indemnity Payment_ " means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

(v) " _Third Party Claim_ " means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made
or brought by any Person that is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate
thereof.

SECTION 8.5.  _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than 30 calendar days after becoming aware) thereof and such
notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim and any documents
relating to the claim and an estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall
reference the specific sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such
claim; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying
any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder
unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced
by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee failed to give
such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor,
within five calendar days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee
relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not (as long as it
conducts such defense) be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee shall
have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in
the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnitors request) the provision to the Indemnitor of records and
information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
and directors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors prior
written consent. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third

 



18  Party Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a
Third Party Claim with the Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement
(i) includes a release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy and (iii) does not include a statement or
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement
offer that satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso of the
immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to
such settlement, then thereafter the Indemnitors liability to the Indemnitee
with respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitors
portion of the settlement amount included in such settlement offer, and the
Indemnitee shall either assume the defense of such Third Party Claim or pay
the Indemnitors attorneys fees and other out-of-pocket costs incurred
thereafter in continuing the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

SECTION 8.6. _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days
within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account
of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will
be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee.

SECTION 8.7. _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except as set forth in _Section 9.7(b)_, if the Closing occurs, their sole
and exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than any cause of action arising from actual fraud shall be pursuant to
the provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_.

 

SECTION 8.8. _Certain Other Matters_. Upon making any Indemnity Payment,
Indemnitor will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated (on a
non-recourse basis and without any representation or warranty by the
Indemnitee) to all rights of Indemnitee against any third Person (other than
any Tax authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity
Payment related. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other
provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
above-described subrogation rights. Any payment received in respect of such
rights shall be distributed, first, to the Indemnitor in an aggregate amount
equal to the Indemnity Payments actually made by the Indemnitor to the
Indemnitee in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and, second, the balance, if
any, to the Indemnitee.

SECTION 8.9. _No Contribution_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have
any right of contribution or other right or remedy against the Company with
respect to any inaccuracy, breach or failure to timely perform, as applicable,
any of Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
hereunder. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives and releases the Company from any such
right or remedy.

 



19 SECTION 8.10. _Effect of Investigation_. No due diligence review, audit or
other investigation or inquiry undertaken or performed by or on behalf of any
party hereto shall limit, qualify, modify or amend the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the other party hereto or the
indemnities by such other party hereto contained in this Agreement,
irrespective of the knowledge and information received (or which should have
been received) therefrom by or on behalf of such party. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the representations and warranties also operate as
bargained for promises and risk allocation devices and that, accordingly, any
partys knowledge, and the waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or
payment of Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this _Article VIII_.

 

ARTICLE IX.

SECTION 9.3. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
references herein to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation
are to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. Any fact or item disclosed in any Schedule shall be deemed
disclosed against all other Sections in _Article III_ to the extent the
applicability of such fact or item to such Section of _Article III_ is
reasonably apparent. Disclosure of any item in a Schedule shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material item, fact, exception of
fact, event or circumstance or that occurrence or non-occurrence of any change
or effect related to such item would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall include the
plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall include the
singular, where appropriate. Whenever the word "Dollars" or the "$" sign
appear in this Agreement, they shall be construed to mean United States
Dollars, and all transactions under this Agreement shall be in United States
Dollars. All time periods within or following which any payment is to be made
or act is to be done shall be

 



21  calculated by excluding the date on which the period commences and including
the date on which the period ends and by extending the period to the first
succeeding Business Day if the last day of the period is not a Business Day.
This Agreement has been fully negotiated by the parties hereto and shall not
be construed by any Governmental Entity against either party by virtue of the
fact that such party was the drafting party.

 

SECTION 9.4. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including all exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Assignment of Units and, solely for the purposes of _Section 2.1_, the
SPA constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as
expressly set forth herein, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

 

SECTION 9.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

SECTION 9.6. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by
operation of law in a merger), by either party without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such assignment that is not consented to
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.7. _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City, State and County of New
York (each, a " _New York Court_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement
or determining any claim arising from or related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In any such action, suit or
other proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise
any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York
Court, that such action, suit or other proceeding is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such
action, suit or other proceeding is improper; _provided_ , that nothing set
forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the parties hereto from removing
any matter from one New York Court to another New York Court. Each of the
parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a
party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding will be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
will be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.
Any process or 

 



22  other paper to be served in connection with any action or proceeding under
this Agreement shall, if delivered or sent in accordance with _Section 9.2_,
constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, this being in addition (subject
to the terms of this Agreement) to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action, suit, claim,
litigation or similar proceeding is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party
hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate
remedy at law.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.7_.

 

SECTION 9.8. _Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver_.

 

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.

(b) This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by each
of Buyer and Seller. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

 

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 



23 SECTION 9.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart
of this Agreement to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any
other electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery
will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed
counterpart.

5 ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Standing_.

 

(a) Seller is a New York corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust is a
Delaware statutory trust duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite organizational
power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold (or permit Wilmington
Trust to own lease or otherwise hold) the assets and properties owned, leased
or otherwise held by it (or by Wilmington Trust for its benefit) and to carry
on (or permit Wilmington Trust to carry on) its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of
the Trust Agreement and the certificate of trust of the Trust, each as
amended to the date hereof.

3.2 _Authority_. Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a party and
to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and
delivery by Seller of the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a
party and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated thereby
have been and, with respect to the Transaction Agreement to be executed and
delivered at Closing, will be, duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Seller. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which
Seller is or will be a party have been or, with respect to the Transaction
Agreement to be executed and delivered at the Closing, will be, duly executed
and delivered by Seller and, assuming the Transaction Agreements
constitute valid and binding agreements of the other parties thereto,
constitute, or upon execution and delivery thereof will constitute, valid and
binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

3.3 _Consents; No Conflicts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ , the
execution and delivery by Seller of the Transaction Agreements to which it is
or will be a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby by Seller, do not and will not (a) conflict with any of the provisions
of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Seller or the Trust
Agreement, (b) subject to the matters referred to in the next

 



6  sentence, conflict with, result in a breach of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, give rise to a right of termination
under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on
any property or asset of the Trust under, any material contract to which the
Trust is a party or by which it is bound as of the date hereof or (c) subject
to the matters referred to in the next sentence, contravene any Applicable
Law, which, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or
notice to, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Seller in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by
Seller, or the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated thereby, except for any consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings or notices that if not obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

3.4 _Interests; Beneficiary_. Seller owns all of the beneficial interests in
the Trust, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than
Permitted Liens. Seller is the sole Beneficiary (as defined in the Trust
Agreement), including with respect to each Owner Trust Estate (as defined in
the Trust Agreement) of each Trust Series.

3.5 _Trust Series; Derivative Contracts_. _Schedule 3.5(a)_ lists each
Trust Series established as of the date hereof, and identifies which of such
Trust Series are active as of the date hereof. _Schedule 3.5(b)_ lists each
derivative contracts to which the Trust is a party, and identifies the
counterparty thereto and the notional amount thereof.

3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Trust does not have any material
liabilities other than obligations that are being insured by Radian Asset
Assurance Inc., an insurance company organized under the laws of the State of
New York.

 

3.7 _Taxes_. The Trust has timely paid all Taxes that it was required to pay,
whether or not such Taxes were shown on a Tax return. All material Tax
returns filed by the Trust on or prior to the Closing Date are correct and
complete in all material respects. The Trust is not a party to, bound by or
obligated under any Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar contract
or arrangement. The Trust does not have any liability for the Taxes of any
Person as a transferee or successor, or under Treasury Regulations section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law). The Trust
has not ever participated in any "listed transactions" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). The Trust is currently, and has
been since the date of its formation, a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

3.8 _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, against the Trust. None of the Trust or any Affiliate of the
Trust has received any order of any Governmental Entity outstanding against
the Trust or any of its assets, properties or businesses that enjoins or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.9 _Employees_. The Trust does not and never has had any employees.

 



7 3.10 _Business_. Since the Trusts formation, the Trust has not engaged in any
business other than entering into credit default swaps to provide credit
protection of synthetic CDOs, synthetic CDOs of commercial mortgage-backed
securities or debt securities, including trust preferred securities, each such
credit default swap being backed by a financial guaranty insurance policy
issued by Radian Asset Assurance Inc.

3.11 _Solvency_. Immediately following the Closing and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Trust will be Solvent. No
transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Trust or any of its Affiliates. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Solvent_ ," when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date
of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (x) the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with Applicable Law governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (y) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person with respect to its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date and (c) such Person will be able to
pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including a reasonable estimate of contingent
and other liabilities" means that such Person will be able to generate enough
cash to meet its obligations as they become due.

 

3.12 _Limitations of Representations and Warranties_. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY
SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE III_ , SELLER MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO BUYER, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, IN CONNECTION WITH
THE TRANSACTION. SUBJECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN
THIS _ARTICLE III_ , SELLERS INTEREST IN THE TRUST IS BEING TRANSFERRED
THROUGH THE SALE OF THE INTERESTS, AND THE INTERESTS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE
DIRECTLY, AND ANY INTEREST OF SELLER IN THE ASSETS OWNED BY OR HELD FOR THE
TRUST SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE INDIRECTLY, TRANSFERRED BY SELLER TO BUYER "AS
IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OTHER
THAN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE III_ AS TO
(A) THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF (I) THE INTERESTS AND (II) THE TRUST
AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS AND (B) THE PROSPECTS
(FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF (I) THE OWNERSHIP OF
THE INTERESTS AND (II) THE TRUST OR ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as follows::

 

4.1 _Organization and Standing_. Buyer is a corporation, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

4.2 _Authority_. Buyer has the requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a party and
to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and
delivery by Buyer of the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a
party and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated thereby
have been and, with respect to the Transaction Agreement to be executed and
delivered at Closing, will be, duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Buyer. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which
Buyer is or will be a party have been or, with respect to the Transaction
Agreement to be executed and delivered at the Closing, will be, duly executed
and delivered by Buyer and, assuming the Transaction Agreements constitute
valid and binding agreements of the other parties thereto, constitute, or
upon execution and delivery thereof will constitute, valid and binding
obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their
terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

4.3 _Consents; No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery by Buyer of the
Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by Buyer, do not and
will not (a) conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Buyer, (b) subject to the matters referred to in
the next sentence, conflict with, result in a breach of or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) under, give rise to a right of
termination under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) on any property or asset of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any agreement, permit, license or instrument to which Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or (c) subject to the matters referred to in the
next sentence, contravene any Applicable Law, which, in the case of clauses
(b) and (c) above, would materially impair the ability of Buyer to consummate
any of the transactions contemplated hereby. No consent, approval or
authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or notice to, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Buyer in connection with
the execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by Buyer, or the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated thereby, except for any
consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings or notices which
if not obtained or made would not, in the aggregate, materially impair the
ability of Buyer to consummate any of the transactions contemplated thereby.
To the knowledge of Buyer, no fact or circumstance relating to Buyer or its
Affiliates (including their plans for operating, or causing Wilmington Trust
to operate, the Trust after the Closing) exists that would render Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, unable promptly to obtain any approval,
authorization or consent of any Governmental Entity required to be obtained to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.

 



9 4.4 _Purchase Not for Distribution_. The Interests to be acquired under the
terms of this Agreement will be acquired by Buyer for its own account and not
with a view to distribution. Buyer will not resell, transfer, assign, pledge
or otherwise dispose of any Interests, except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and any
applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an available exemption
therefrom.

4.5  _Limitations of Representations and Warranties_. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY
SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE IV_ , BUYER MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO SELLER, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, IN CONNECTION
WITH THE TRANSACTION.

ARTICLE V

 

COVENANTS

5.1  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Other Action_.

(a) From and after the date hereof, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all action and
promptly to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the Transaction. Each party hereto shall
execute and deliver both before and after the Closing such further agreements
and other documents, including any such agreements and documents reasonably
required by Wilmington Trust, and take such other actions as the other party
hereto may reasonably request to consummate or implement the Transaction or to
evidence the same.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.1(a)_, prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith with Wilmington Trust
to enter into, and enter into with Wilmington Trust, an amended and restated
Trust Agreement (including with respect to each series trust agreement),
effective as of the Closing (collectively, the " _New Trust Agreements_ "),
which New Trust Agreements shall (i) replace Seller (and all rights, title,
interest, obligations and liabilities of Seller, as applicable) in the Trust
Agreement (including each series trust agreement) with Buyer (and the rights,
title, interest, obligations and liabilities of Buyer, as applicable) for all
purposes under the Trust Agreement (including each series trust agreement)
and any other documents or instruments referenced therein and (ii) replace
each reference to "EFS-AGIC Master Business Trust" with a name that does not
include a reference to Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any acronym
representing Seller or any of its Affiliates, in the Trust Agreement
(including each series trust agreement) and any other documents or instruments
referenced therein. Immediately following the Closing, Buyer shall file, or
cause to be filed, an amended and restated certificate of trust for the Trust
pursuant to Section 3810 of the Business Trust Statute that does not include a
reference to Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any acronym
representing Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



10 5.2 _Access to Books and Records_. Until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing or such earlier time that Seller has provided written notice to Buyer
that the information and access described below is no longer reasonably
required by Seller ( _provided_ , that Buyer shall give 30 days notice to
Seller prior to destroying any records to permit Seller, at its expense, to
examine, duplicate or repossess such books and records), Buyer shall afford
promptly to Seller and its Representatives access to the books, records,
officers, employees, auditors and other advisors of the Trust, and provide
information with respect to the Trust in a readily accessible form (including
financial information in a form consistent with the Trusts historical
practice for the preparation of such financial information), to the
extent reasonably required by Seller for any lawful business purpose,
including litigation, disputes, compliance, financial reporting (including
financial audits of historical information), loss reporting, regulatory, tax
and accounting matters, and Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller and its
Representatives to furnish such books and records and information and make
available such officers, employees, auditors and other advisors of the Trust;
_provided_ , that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Buyer or the Trust. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Trust to implement an internal
process to ensure the deletion of all data relating to Seller or
its Affiliates from any computers, hard drives or other similar electronic
devices prior to disposing of any such device.

5.3 _Public Announcement_. Each of Buyer and Seller, and their respective
Affiliates, shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including with respect to the operation of the business of the
Trust) and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement with respect to such matters without the advance approval of the
other party following such consultation (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Applicable Law or by the
requirements of any securities exchange; _provided_ , that, in the
event that, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel, any party is required
by Applicable Law or the requirements of any securities exchange to issue any
such press release or make any public statement and it is not feasible to
obtain the advance approval of the other party hereto as required by this
_Section 5.3_, the party that issues such press release or makes such
statement shall provide the other party with notice and a copy of such press
release or statement as soon as reasonably practicable.

TERMINATION

7.1  _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order, injunction or

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(a)_ shall have

acted in good faith;

 

(b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to the date that is 30 days after the Closing Date (as defined in the SPA),
unless the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a material breach
of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; _provided_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section
7.1(b)_ will not be available to any party if the other party has, in good
faith, filed an action, suit, claim, litigation or similar proceeding seeking,

(c) by either Seller or Buyer (but only so long as Seller or Buyer, as

Days after the breaching party receives written notice from the non-breaching

terms; or

of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 1.1_, _Section

13 ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire on the
eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that (i) the
representations and warranties made in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.4_ and 
_3.12_ (collectively " _Seller Fundamental Representations_ ") and _Sections
4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.5_ (collectively " _Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ")
shall survive indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties made
in _Sections 3.7_ and _3.9_ shall survive until 60 days after the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations. Any claim for indemnification in
respect of any representation or warranty that is not asserted by notice
given as required herein prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period specified in this _Section 8.1(a)_ shall not be valid and any right to
indemnification is hereby irrevocably waived after the expiration of such
period of survival. Any claim properly made for an Indemnifiable Loss in
respect of a breach of any such representation or warranty asserted within
such period of survival as herein provided will be timely made for
purposes hereof, in which case the survival period with respect to the
applicable representation or warranty shall be extended solely for purposes of
such claim until such claim is finally and fully resolved.

 

(b) To the extent that it is to be performed after the Closing, each covenant
in this Agreement will, for purposes of this _Article VIII_ , survive and
remain in effect in accordance with its terms plus a period of six months
thereafter, after which no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may
be brought hereunder. All covenants in this Agreement that by their terms are
required to be fully performed prior to the Closing will, for purposes of this
_Article VIII_ , survive the Closing until the eighteen month anniversary of
the Closing Date, after which no claim for indemnification with respect
thereto may be brought hereunder. If a claim for indemnification is submitted
with respect to any covenant within the applicable period of survival as set
forth in this _Section 8.1(b)_, the survival period with respect to such
covenant shall be extended solely for purposes of such claim until such claim
is finally and fully resolved.

8.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and each of
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses paid, incurred or suffered by such Buyer
Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from or arising out of: 

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent specifically
made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) of any
representation or warranty of Seller made in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by Seller in connection herewith;

 



14 (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller
under this Agreement;

(iii) any Taxes of, imposed on or relating to the Trust for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (for the avoidance of doubt this shall include any Taxes imposed
as result of the sale of the Interests); and

(iv) any Taxes of Persons (other than the Trust) for which the Trust, Buyer
or any of their Affiliates are liable (A) by reason of the application of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 and any corresponding provision of state,
local, or foreign law or (B) that result from a failure by Seller to properly
withhold Taxes on payments with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and each
of its and their respective directors, officers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses paid, incurred or suffered by such Seller
Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though made on and as of the Closing Date) of any representation or warranty
of Buyer made in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Seller in
connection herewith; and

 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer under
this Agreement.

 

(c) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation or warranty as well as the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses
under this _Article VIII_ , each representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be read without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifier contained therein.

 

8.3 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) No party shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless its respective
Indemnitees under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (in the case of Seller) or _Section
8.2(b)(i)_ (in the case of Buyer) (i) with respect to any claim, unless such
claim involves Indemnifiable Losses in excess of $25,000 (the " _De Minimis
Amount_ ") (nor shall any claim that does not exceed the De Minimis Amount be
applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible under clause (ii)
below) and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all 

 



15  Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under such _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or
such _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, exceeds $200,000 for all
Indemnifiable Losses (the " _Deductible_ "), at which point such Indemnitor
shall be liable to its respective Indemnitees for the value of the
Indemnitees claims under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or such _Section 8.2(b)(i)_,
as the case may be, that is in excess of the Deductible, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_. The maximum aggregate liability
of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, to their respective
Indemnitees for any and all Indemnifiable Losses under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_,
in the case of Seller, or _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, in the case of Buyer, shall be
$1,200,000; _provided_ , that the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to all
Buyer Indemnified Persons for any and all Indemnifiable Losses under this
Agreement (other than under _Sections 8.2(a)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ ) shall not
exceed $2,500,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in the
previous sentences of this  _Section 8.3(a)_ (other than the limitation in
the immediately preceding proviso) shall not be applicable to any
Indemnifiable Losses asserted in respect of the Seller Fundamental
Representations or the Buyer Fundamental Representations. 

(b) If any Buyer Indemnified Person actually realizes a Tax benefit in respect
of an Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 8.4(iii)_ or subsequent to an
Indemnity Payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor
the amount of such Tax benefit realized by such Buyer Indemnified Person up to
the amount of such Indemnity Payment received by the Indemnitee, net of any
expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Person in pursuing such
Tax benefit, within 15 days after the Buyer Indemnified Person realizes such
Tax benefit in the form of cash actually received or reduction in cash Taxes
actually paid. If any Tax benefit (or portion thereof) in respect of an
Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section 8.4(iii)_, that either (i)
reduces the Indemnity Payments made by an Indemnitor prior to the time such
payment is made or (ii) obligates an Indemnitee to make payments to the
Indemnitor under the immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 8.3(b)_,
is disallowed as a result of an audit or otherwise, the applicable Indemnitor
shall promptly pay to the applicable Indemnitee the amount of such disallowed
Tax benefit within 30 days after the Indemnitee notifies the Indemnitor that
the adjustment with respect to such disallowance has been paid or otherwise
taken into account.

 

(c) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum
amount recoverable with respect thereto under any insurance or reinsurance
coverage or other applicable source of recovery (it being understood that no
Indemnity Payment to be made hereunder may be withheld due to the fact that
any such mitigation efforts have not been successful if such Indemnitee has
complied with its obligations under this _Section 8.3(c)_).

 



16 8.4 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Indemnitee_ " means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

 

(ii) " _Indemnitor_ " means any Person required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement;

 

(iii) " _Indemnifiable Losses_ " means any and all damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses); _provided_ , that any Indemnity Payment (x) shall in no
event include any amounts constituting (A) punitive damages or consequential
damages (in either case except to the extent awarded to a third party and
actually paid to such third party in connection with a Third Party Claim) and
(B) damages for lost profits and (y) shall be net of any (A) amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnitee for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such
Indemnity Payment is made under any insurance policy, reinsurance agreement,
warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person other than a party hereto
or its Affiliates (net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in pursuing
such recovery), and the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for
any such amount that is actually received by it from any such other Person
with respect to an Indemnifiable Losses after any indemnification with respect
thereto has actually been paid pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) as
determined pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, Tax benefits actually realized by
the Indemnitee (or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Person, any other Buyer
Indemnified Person) in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses for which such
Indemnity Payment is made (it being understood that no Indemnity Payment to be
made hereunder may be withheld or otherwise delayed due to the fact that an
anticipated Tax benefit has not actually been realized by the applicable
Indemnitee);

(iv) " _Indemnity Payment_ " means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

(v) " _Third Party Claim_ " means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made
or brought by any Person that is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate
thereof.

8.5  _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than 30 calendar days after becoming aware) thereof and such
notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim and any documents
relating to the claim and an estimate of the Indemnifiable

 



17  Loss and shall reference the specific sections of this Agreement that form
the basis of such claim; _provided_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five calendar days after the Indemnitees receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by
the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not (as long as it
conducts such defense) be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the
defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee shall
have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in the
defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnitors request) the provision to the Indemnitor of records and
information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
and directors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or
not the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors
prior written consent. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a
Third Party Claim with the Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement
(i) includes a release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy and (iii) does not include a statement or
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement
offer that satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso of the
immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to such
settlement, then thereafter the Indemnitors liability to the Indemnitee with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitors portion of
the settlement amount included in such settlement offer, and the Indemnitee
shall either assume the defense of such Third Party Claim or pay the
Indemnitors attorneys fees and other out-of-pocket costs incurred thereafter
in continuing the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 



18 8.6 _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days within which
to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an
Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will
be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be
entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee.

8.7 _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as
set forth in _Section 9.7(b)_, if the Closing occurs, their sole and
exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than any cause of action arising from actual fraud shall be pursuant to
the provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_.

 

8.8 _Certain Other Matters_. Upon making any Indemnity Payment, Indemnitor
will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated (on a non-
recourse basis and without any representation or warranty by the Indemnitee)
to all rights of Indemnitee against any third Person (other than any Tax
authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity Payment
related. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision
hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described
subrogation rights. Any payment received in respect of such rights shall be
distributed, first, to the Indemnitor in an aggregate amount equal to the
Indemnity Payments actually made by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee in
respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and, second, the balance, if any, to the
Indemnitee.

8.9 _No Contribution_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any right of
contribution or other right or remedy against the Trust with respect to any
inaccuracy, breach or failure to timely perform, as applicable, any of
Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder.
Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
hereby irrevocably waives and releases the Trust from any such right or
remedy.

 

8.10 _Effect of Investigation_. No due diligence review, audit or other
investigation or inquiry undertaken or performed by or on behalf of any party
hereto shall limit, qualify, modify or amend the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the other party hereto or the indemnities by such
other party hereto contained in this Agreement, irrespective of the knowledge
and information received (or which should have been received) therefrom by or
on behalf of such party. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
representations and warranties also operate as bargained for promises and risk
allocation devices and that, accordingly, any partys knowledge, and the
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or payment of

9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an Exhibit
or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All references
herein to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation are to the
agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. Any fact or item disclosed in any Schedule shall be deemed
disclosed against all other Sections in _Article III_ to the extent the
applicability of such fact or item to such Section of _Article III_ is
reasonably apparent. Disclosure of any item in a Schedule shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material item, fact, exception of
fact, event or circumstance or that occurrence or non-occurrence of any change
or effect related to such item would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall include the
plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall include the
singular, where appropriate. Whenever the word "Dollars" or the "$" sign
appear in this Agreement, they shall be construed to mean United States
Dollars, and all transactions under this Agreement shall be in United States
Dollars. All time periods within or following which any payment is to be made
or act is to be done shall be calculated by excluding the date on which the
period commences and including the date on which the period ends and by
extending the period to the first succeeding Business Day if the last day of
the period is not a Business Day. This Agreement has been fully negotiated by
the parties hereto and shall not be construed by any Governmental Entity
against either party by virtue of the fact that such party was the drafting
party.

9.4  _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including
all exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Assignment of Interests and, solely for the purposes of _Section 2.1_, the
SPA constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as
expressly set forth herein, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

9.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 



21 9.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by operation
of law in a merger), by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party, and any such assignment that is not consented to shall be null
and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

9.7 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City, State and County of New
York (each, a " _New York Court_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement
or determining any claim arising from or related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In any such action, suit or
other proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise
any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York
Court, that such action, suit or other proceeding is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such
action, suit or other proceeding is improper; _provided_ , that nothing set
forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the parties hereto from removing
any matter from one New York Court to another New York Court. Each of the
parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a
party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding will be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
will be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.
Any process or other paper to be served in connection with any action or
proceeding under this Agreement shall, if delivered or sent in accordance with
_Section 9.2_, constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, this being in
addition (subject to the terms of this Agreement) to any other remedy to which
such party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action,
suit, claim, litigation or similar proceeding is brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party
hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate
remedy at law.

 



22 (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.7_.

9.8 _Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver_.

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained
herein.

(b) This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by each
of Buyer and Seller. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

 

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 

9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart
of this Agreement to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any
other electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery
will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed
counterpart.

 _TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT_

 

This TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of [], is
by and among Radian Group Inc., a company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware (" _Licensor_ "), and Assured Guaranty Corp., a
Maryland insurance company (together with its Affiliates, " _Licensee_ ").
Licensor and Licensee shall be referred to collectively in this Agreement as
the " _Parties_."

 

WHEREAS, Radian Guaranty Inc., an insurance company organized under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a wholly owned subsidiary of Licensor
(" _Seller_ "), and Licensee have entered into that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2014 (the " _SPA_ "), whereby Licensee has
acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Radian Asset
Assurance Inc., an insurance company organized under the laws of the State of
New York (the " _Company_ ");

 

WHEREAS, Licensor is the owner of those trademarks and service marks set forth
on Schedule 1 attached hereto and identified in the SPA as the Seller
Trademarks (the " _Radian Marks_ "), the Radian Marks being currently in use
in connection with the business of the Company and its Subsidiary (the "
_Acquired Business_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire that Licensee have limited use of the Radian Marks
in connection with the Acquired Business on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants contained
herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which the Parties acknowledge, the parties agree as follows:

1.  _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined
herein shall be used as defined in the SPA.

2\. _License to the Radian Marks_. Licensor hereby grants Licensee a limited,
non-exclusive, non-assignable (except as set forth in Section 18), non-
sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 3), royalty-free, fully paid
right and license to use those Radian Marks solely in connection with the
operation of the Acquired Business, with such Radian Marks being used in a
manner substantially similar to the use of the Radian Marks by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date, in the United States for ninety (90)
days following the Closing; _provided_ that Licensee must use the Radian Marks
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. Licensee shall
have no right or license to use the Radian Marks at the end of or following
the ninety (90) day period following the Closing.

3\. _Right to Grant Sublicenses_.

 

(a) _Radian Marks_. Licensee shall have the right to grant sublicenses of the
Radian Marks to Affiliates and to independent contractors (including
consultants and vendors) of Licensee who provide products or services to
Licensee solely for the purpose of the servicing and administration of the
Acquired Business, so long as (i) no such sublicense shall relieve Licensee of
its obligations hereunder, (ii) Licensee agrees to indemnify Licensor against
any claims, losses or other liabilities arising from such sublicensees breach
of the terms of this  Agreement, (iii) such sublicense is limited to the use of the Radian Marks
and no sublicensee shall have the right to further sublicense (except to such
sublicensees own Affiliates or subsidiaries) such Radian Marks or use marks
derived therefrom; and (iv) such sublicensee ceases use of the Radian Marks at
the end of the ninety (90) day period following the Closing.

 

4\. _Quality Control and Standards_. Licensee hereby acknowledges that the
Radian Marks have established valuable goodwill and reputation, and that it
is of great importance to Licensor that this goodwill and reputation be
maintained. Licensee agrees that the nature and quality of all products and
services provided or offered by Licensee in connection with the trademarks as
permitted hereunder shall be at least equal to the standard of quality
maintained by Licensor in connection with such products and services
immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, " _Trademark Licensor Quality
Standards_ "). Licensee agrees to make available for review, upon Licensors
reasonable request, samples of materials not previously provided and approved
by Licensor that incorporate the Radian Marks, including, but not limited to,
advertising copy, labels, stickers, policies, brochures or other materials,
including any applicable materials in connection with Licensees rebranding
efforts with respect to the Acquired Business (collectively, the " _Materials_
"). If Licensor objects to the manner in which a trademark licensed hereunder
is used in connection with any Materials because it violates the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Licensor may request in writing that Licensee
take, and Licensee shall promptly take, reasonable steps to remedy any such
deficiencies within ten (10) days after such notification, including to
promptly discontinue the use of any such Materials, it being understood that a
failure by Licensee to take such steps shall constitute a material breach of
this Agreement. If after such ten (10) days cure period, the product or
service in question continues not to conform in all material respects to the
Trademark Licensor Quality Standards, Licensor may terminate this Agreement
upon ten (10) days prior written notice delivered to Licensee, which
termination shall not limit or be deemed a waiver of any other rights or
remedies of Licensor.

 

5\. _Depiction of the Marks_. Licensee agrees to comply with any requirements
established by Licensor that are communicated to Licensee in writing
concerning the style, design, display and use of the Radian Marks (the "
_Trademark Licensor Standards_ ") in connection with materials not previously
provided and approved by Licensor, including any such requirements
regarding (a) the use of the trademark symbols "TM" or "SM" or United States
registration symbol "®", as applicable, and (b) use of a clear notice or other
appropriate disclosure, the form of which shall be mutually agreed upon by
Licensor and Licensee concerning the ownership of the trademarks and the
licensing relationship between the Parties (" _Ownership Disclosure_ ").

 

In connection herewith, Licensee may use the following Ownership Disclosure:

 

"[The Licensed Mark(s)][is/are][registered] trademark(s) owned by [Licensor]
and [is/are] used under license."

 

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the Radian Marks may only be used hereunder in
the same appearance in use as of the Closing and (y) such marks may not be
modified through combination with any other logo, design, symbol, trademark,
service mark, company or corporate name or commercial slogan or with any
prefix or suffix or any modifying word or term hereunder, except as agreed to
in writing by the Parties prior to any such use.

 



\- 2 - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5, in no
event shall Licensee be liable to Licensor or any third party for any
improper designation included within the Trademark Licensor Standards or
otherwise done at Licensors request.

 

6\. _Ownership_. Licensor represents and warrants that Licensor owns
sufficient right, title and interest in and to the Radian Marks to grant the
licenses described in this Agreement. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that:
(a) ownership of the Radian Marks and the goodwill relating thereto shall
remain vested in Licensor both during the period of this Agreement and
thereafter; (b) any use of the Radian Marks by Licensee (and any goodwill
arising therefrom) shall inure to the exclusive benefit of Licensor; (c)
Licensee will not adopt, use, register, file or maintain any registration or
application for registration of, any trademark, service mark, trade name,
slogan, Internet domain name or other identifier or device that constitutes or
includes any Radian Mark or is confusingly similar to any Radian Mark; (d)
Licensee will not represent that it has an ownership interest in the Radian
Marks or any registrations or applications for registration therefor; and (e)
Licensee will not do, or cause to be done, any act or thing directly or
indirectly challenging, attacking, disputing, contesting, diluting,
disparaging or impairing the Radian Marks or Licensors exclusive right, title
and interest in and to the Radian Marks (or the goodwill associated
therewith), any registrations or applications for registration therefor. 

7\. _Policing of Marks_. Licensee agrees to promptly inform Licensor of any
actual or apparent infringement or violation by any third party of any Radian
Mark of which Licensee has actual knowledge, including any written notice of
infringement received by Licensee from any third party. Licensor shall
determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not any action shall be taken
with respect to such alleged violation or infringement and the nature of the
action to be taken. Licensor shall have full authority and control over any
assertion of infringement of or with respect to the Radian Marks and Licensee
shall provide reasonable assistance to Licensor at Licensors reasonable
request and at Licensors sole cost. Any recovery obtained by Licensor as a
result of any such action shall belong solely to Licensor.

 

8\. _Term_. The term of this Agreement shall commence at Closing and shall
continue for a period of ninety (90) days or until otherwise terminated in
accordance with Section 9 below.

9\. _Termination_. Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
on written notice to Licensee: (a) in accordance with Section 4 of this
Agreement, (b) in the event Licensee directly or indirectly challenges,
attacks, disputes or contests any of the Radian Marks, or
Licensors exclusive ownership or any other rights in, any Radian Mark and,
to the extent that such acts are capable of justification or retraction,
Licensee fails to satisfactorily justify or retract such acts within fifteen
(15) days after Licensor provides Licensee with written notice of its intent
to terminate; (c) in the event Licensee commits any other material breach of
the Agreement and, to the extent that such breach is capable of cure, Licensee
fails to take reasonable steps to cure such breach within fifteen (15) days
after Licensor provides Licensee

benefit of its creditors; (ii) voluntarily or involuntarily enters into

substantial part of its undertakings or assets. The Parties may additionally
terminate this Agreement upon mutual written agreement.

In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of

that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper;
_provided_ that nothing set forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the
parties hereto from removing any matter from one New York Court to another New

TERM SHEET - TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

Set forth below are general business terms to be included in the TSA. In
addition, the TSA will include customary provisions with respect
to confidentiality, personal data, warranties, indemnities, liabilities,
termination and other matters.

1\. _Term_. The term of the TSA, and each of the Services, will be six (6)
months, except that Office Space (as defined below) will be provided for sixty
(60) days.

 

2\. _Termination Right_. Buyer may terminate one or more of the Services at
any time upon providing sufficient advance notice to Seller, and may then
discontinue paying any incremental costs of Seller for such terminated
Service, but must pay any fixed or sunk costs of Seller incurred specifically
to provide such terminated Service for the remainder of the term.

 

3\. _Services_. As part of the Services, Seller responsibilities under the TSA
will include:

 



     | (a) | transferring to Buyer existing hard copy records for the
Companys accounting, HR, underwriting, surveillance, workout, e-mail and
other records and data. For the electronic records of such data, separating
such electronic data from Sellers systems, and helping Buyer migrate,
convert such data into a format acceptable to Buyer and integrate such data
onto Buyers designated systems, at Buyers expense (collectively, the "
_Data Transfer_ "); 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | providing to Buyer (or its designee) a reasonable level of
knowledge transfer, migration assistance and other related support as
reasonably requested by Buyer, including, without limitation, assistance with
respect to the transfer of applications, programs, licenses and other assets
as contemplated by this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | continuing to provide, or causing to be provided, to the
Company or Buyer, as directed by Buyer, the services necessary to allow Buyer
to conduct the Business as it was conducted prior to the Closing,
including operating on behalf of the Company or Buyer, or providing the
Company or Buyer with, continued access to Sellers accounting, HR,
underwriting, surveillance, e-mail, telecommunications, network, disaster
recovery, business applications, daily operations, paper records and
electronic backup data and other systems and services used for or by the
Company prior to the Closing, together with appropriate maintenance, support,
monitoring, security, management and administration services, each as would
be consistent with a joint transition plan agreed by the parties, provided
that any costs related to any third party consents will be negotiated as part
of the larger agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Buyer and Seller shall create a joint Transition Committee
that will develop a mutually acceptable Transition Plan to govern the timing
and manner of migration and transition; and 
---|---|--- occupancy by the Companys personnel of all office space used by the Company
in any facility of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller as of the Closing ("
_Office Space_ "), in any event not to exceed August 30, 2015. 
---|---|--- 

4\. _Service Standard/Level of Services_. Seller shall perform the Services
at substantially the same level as provided in the 12 months immediately prior
to the Closing, and in all instances in accordance with applicable laws.
Separation and migration services shall be provided by Seller in a timely and
reasonably diligent manner. Buyer shall be required to reasonably cooperate
with Seller. Seller shall provide the Services with priority equal to that
provided in the 12 months immediately prior to the Closing with respect to
its own businesses and the businesses of its Affiliates. Buyer will be
reasonably notified prior to any planned interruption of Services.

 

5\. _Payment_. The price for the Services will be Sellers allocated costs for
performing the relevant Service, consistent with Sellers historical costs,
without overhead allocation and without profit, as further described in the
TSA, and all actual out-of pocket costs related to the Services (subject to
negotiation with respect to third party consents). Buyer shall be invoiced
for the Services on a monthly basis in arrears. All undisputed amounts will be
paid by Buyer to Seller within 30 days of its receipt of a proper invoice.
