Section 2.5  _Assumption and Assignment of Contracts_.

(a) The Sale Order shall provide for the assumption by the Domestic Selling
Entities, and the Sale Order shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide
for the assignment by the Domestic Selling Entities to the Buyer and/or one or
more Buyer Designees, of the Assumed  



 

22  Domestic Agreements and the Assumed Domestic Real Property Leases on the
terms and conditions set forth in the remainder of this _Section 2.5_,
and shall provide for the Designation Deadline as defined herein. At the
Buyers request, and at the Buyers cost and expense, the Selling Entities
shall cooperate with the Buyer as reasonably requested by the Buyer (i) to
allow the Buyer to enter into an amendment with any Domestic Real Property
Lease upon assumption of such Domestic Real Property Lease by the Buyer or a
Buyer Designee, and shall cooperate with the Buyer to the extent reasonably
requested with the Buyer in negotiations with the landlords thereof, or (ii)
to otherwise amend any Domestic Real Property Lease to the extent such
amendments would not adversely affect any of the Selling Entities; _provided_
that the Selling Entities shall not be required to enter into any such
amendment if such amendment would result in an assumption by any Selling
Entity of such Domestic Real Property Lease, unless such Domestic Real
Property Lease will be assigned to the Buyer or a Buyer Designee at the time
of such assumption.

(b) On or prior to the applicable Designation Deadline, the Buyer may, in its
sole discretion, (i)(x) designate any Domestic Non-Real Property Contract as
an Assumed Domestic Agreement or any Domestic Real Property Lease as an
Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease, and (y) from and after the Closing, by
providing written notice to the Seller, specify a date no earlier than ten
(10) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in any case where the
Designation Deadline is the Closing Date) following delivery of such notice on
which any Specified Contract or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease
specified in such notice will be assumed by the respective Selling Entity and
assigned to the Buyer or the Buyer Designee specified in such notice, or (ii)
designate any Domestic Non-Real Property Contract or any Domestic Real
Property Lease as a Contract that is not to be an Assumed Domestic Agreement
or an Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease, in each case by providing written
notice of such designation or removal to the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the Buyers designation rights pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(b)_, the Buyer shall designate a minimum of 250 Domestic Real
Property Leases as Assumed Domestic Real Property Leases and shall assume, or
cause a Buyer Designee to assume, all such Assumed Domestic Real Property
Leases on or prior to the Designation Deadline. Upon delivery of a
notification by the Buyer with respect to any Specified Contract or Assumed
Domestic Real Property Lease under  _Section 2.5(b)(i)(y)_ herein, the
applicable Selling Entity shall move to assign such Specified Contract or
Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease to the Buyer or the Buyer Designee as set
forth in the applicable notice and shall assume and assign to, and the Buyer
shall or shall cause such Buyer Designee to accept the assignment of, such
Specified Contract or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease. Upon the Buyers
designation of a Domestic Non-Real Property Contract or any Domestic Real
Property Lease under _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_ herein, the applicable Selling
Entity may move to reject such Domestic Non-Real Property Contract or Domestic
Real Property Lease at any time following receipt of the Buyers respective
notice. In the event that the Buyer has designated any Domestic Non-Real
Property Contract as an Assumed Domestic Agreement or any Domestic Real
Property Lease as an Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease prior to the
applicable Designation Deadline, but has not delivered a notification with
respect thereto in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)(i)(y)_ prior to the date
that is at least ten (10) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in any case
where the Designation Deadline is the Closing Date) prior to the applicable
Designation Deadline, then the applicable Selling Entity shall assume and
assign, and Buyer shall, or shall cause a Buyer Designee to, accept the
assignment of, such Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real
Property Lease on the applicable Designation Deadline. In addition,  



 

23  without limiting the Buyers obligations pursuant to the proviso set forth
in the first sentence of this _Section 2.5(b)_, in the event that the Buyer
has not provided a written designation pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)_ at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the applicable Designation Deadline (or
five (5) Business Days in any case where the Designation Deadline is the
Closing Date) to designate any Domestic Non-Real Property Contract as an
Assumed Domestic Agreement or any Domestic Real Property Lease as an Assumed
Domestic Real Property Lease, then the Selling Entities may move to reject
such Domestic Non-Real Property Contract or Domestic Real Property Lease as
of the applicable Designation Deadline, and none of the Domestic Selling
Entities shall have any obligation to assume or to assign any such Domestic
Non-Real Property Contract or Domestic Real Property Lease to the Buyer or
any Buyer Designee hereunder.

(c) After the Closing and prior to the applicable Designation Deadline, the
Selling Entities shall not terminate, amend, supplement, modify, waive any
rights under, or create any Encumbrance with respect to any Specified Contract
or any Domestic Real Property Lease, or increase, or take any affirmative
action not required by the terms thereof, any payments required to be paid
thereunder by any of the Selling Entities or any Buyer Designee contingent
upon any such Specified Contract or Domestic Real Property Lease becoming an
Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease, without
the prior written consent of the Buyer, unless the Buyer has provided notice
to the Seller in writing designating such Specified Contract or Domestic Real
Property Lease for rejection pursuant to  _Section 2.5(b)_.

(d) In the case of any removal or designation notice by the Buyer pursuant to
_Section 2.5(b)_, with respect to any Domestic Non-Real Property Contract or
Domestic Real Property Lease, the Seller shall give notice to the other
parties to any Contract to which such notice relates of the removal or
designation of such Contract as an Assumed Domestic Agreement or an Assumed
Domestic Real Property Lease, as applicable, within three (3) Business Days of
the Buyer notifying the Seller of such designation or removal or such lesser
time as is approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

(e) As part of the Motions (or, as necessary in one or more separate motions),
the Domestic Selling Entities shall request that by virtue of a
Domestic Selling Entity providing ten (10) Business Days notice of its intent
to assume and assign any Contract, the Bankruptcy Court deem any non-debtor
party to such Contract that does not file an objection with the Bankruptcy
Court during such notice period to have given any required Consent to the
assumption of the Contract by the Domestic Selling Entity and assignment to
the Buyer and/or one or more Buyer Designees if, and to the extent that,
pursuant to the Sale Order or other Bankruptcy Court Order, the applicable
Domestic Selling Entity is authorized to assume and assign the Contract to the
Buyer and/or any such Buyer Designee and the Buyer and/or any such Buyer
Designee is authorized to accept such Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed
Domestic Real Property Lease pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

(f) In connection with the assumption and assignment to the Buyer or a Buyer
Designee of any Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property
Lease pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, the cure amounts, as determined by the
Bankruptcy Court, if any (such amounts, the " _Cure Payments_ "), necessary
to cure all defaults, if any, and to pay all actual or pecuniary losses that
have resulted from such defaults under the Assumed Domestic  



 

24  Agreements and the Assumed Domestic Real Property Leases, including any
amounts payable to any landlord under any Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease
that relates to the period prior to the Assumption Approval (including
adjustments as between the Buyer and the Seller for prepaid rent, prepaid
taxes or other prepaid expenses on a per diem basis), shall be paid by the
Seller, on or before the Assumption Approval, and not by the Buyer and the
Buyer shall have no liability therefore (except for any adjustments for
prepaid rent, prepaid taxes or other prepaid expenses on a per diem basis
which shall be payable by Buyer to Seller upon Assumption Approval).

(g) The Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
Order of the Bankruptcy Court to assign the Assumed Domestic Agreements and
the Assumed Domestic Real Property Leases to the Buyer and/or any Buyer
Designees designated by the Seller (the " _Assumption Approval_ ") on the
terms set forth in this _Section 2.5_. In the event the Selling Entities are
unable to assign any such Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real
Property Lease to the Buyer and/or any such Buyer Designee pursuant to an
Order of the Bankruptcy Court, then the Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts prior to the applicable Designation Deadline to obtain, and
to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents and Governmental Authorizations from
Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to assume and
assign such Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property
Lease to the Buyer and/or such Buyer Designee (the " _Necessary Domestic
Consents_ "), including, in the case of the Selling Entities, making any
applicable Cure Payments and any other payments necessary to obtain such
Necessary Domestic Consents; _provided_ , _however_ , that, other than the
payment of Cure Payments as set forth in _Section 2.5(f)_, the Selling
Entities shall not be required to pay any amount or incur any Liability in
order to obtain any Necessary Consents in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate
(the " _Consent Cap_ "), though, in any event, the Selling Entities may, at
their option and in their sole discretion, elect to pay such amounts or incur
such Liabilities in excess of the Consent Cap, and, even upon reaching the
Consent Cap, the Selling Entities shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any remaining Necessary Consents. 

(h) To the extent that any Consent or Governmental Authorization required to
assign to the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designee any Assumed Domestic Agreement
or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease is not obtained by the applicable
Designation Deadline, each Selling Entity will, with respect to each such
Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease, from and
after the Closing and until the earliest to occur of (x) the date on which
such applicable Consent is obtained, and (y) the date on which such Contract
is rejected following the written request of the Buyer, use commercially
reasonable efforts during the term of such Assumed Domestic Agreement or
Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease to (i) provide to the Buyer and/or any
Buyer Designee, as applicable, the benefits under such Assumed Domestic
Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease, (ii) cooperate in any
reasonable and lawful arrangement (including holding such Contract in trust
for the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designee, as applicable, pending receipt of the
required Consent or Governmental Authorization) designed to provide such
benefits to the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designee, as applicable, and (iii)
enforce for the account of the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designee, as applicable,
any rights of such Selling Entity under such Assumed Domestic Agreement or
Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease (including the right to elect to
terminate such Assumed Domestic Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property
Lease in accordance with the terms thereof upon the written direction of the
Buyer). The Buyer will, and, as applicable, will cause  



 

25  the Buyer Designees to, cooperate with the Selling Entities in order to
enable the Selling Entities to provide to the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designee
that purchase any Purchased Assets hereunder the benefits contemplated by
this _Section 2.5(h)_, and Buyer shall promptly pay any and all costs and
expenses incurred by the Selling Entities or their Representatives in
connection with the performance by the Selling Entities of their obligations
under this _Section 2.5(h)_.

(i) The Buyer shall pay, and shall be solely responsible for, any and all
Liabilities arising under any Domestic Non-Real Property Contract or Domestic
Real Property Lease from and after the Closing until such Domestic Non-Real
Property Contract or Domestic Real Property Lease has, in accordance with
this _Section 2.5_, been (i) assumed and assigned to the Buyer or a Buyer
Designee or (ii) rejected by the applicable Selling Entities. In addition, the
Buyer shall perform, or shall cause to be performed, any and all obligations
of the Selling Entities arising under any Domestic Non-Real Property Contract
or Domestic Real Property Lease from and after the Closing until such Domestic
Non-Real Property Contract or Domestic Real Property Lease has, in accordance
with this _Section 2.5_, been (i) assumed and assigned to the Buyer or a
Buyer Designee or (ii) rejected by the applicable Selling Entities. At
Closing, the Seller and the Buyer shall enter into the Transition
Services Agreement pursuant to which the Seller agrees to grant to the Buyer
as a potential purchaser of the Domestic Real Property Leases the right to
operate such leases on the terms therein.

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Contract shall not be an Assumed Domestic
Agreement or Assumed Domestic Real Property Lease hereunder and shall not be
assigned to, or assumed by, the Buyer (or a Buyer Designee) to the extent that
such Contract (i) is rejected by a Selling Entity or terminated by a Selling
Entity or the other party thereto, or terminates or expires by its terms, on
or prior to the Designation Deadline and is not continued or otherwise
extended upon assumption, or (ii) requires a Consent or Governmental
Authorization (other than, and in addition to, that of the Bankruptcy Court)
in order to permit the sale or transfer to the Buyer (or a Buyer Designee) of
the Selling Entities rights under such Contract, and no such Consent or
Governmental Authorization has been obtained prior to the applicable
Designation Deadline. In addition, a Permit shall not be assigned to, or
assumed by, the Buyer (or a Buyer Designee) to the extent that such Permit
requires a Consent or Governmental Authorization (other than, and in addition
to, that of the Bankruptcy Court) in order to permit the sale or transfer
to the Buyer (or a Buyer Designee) of the Selling Entities rights under such
Permit, and no such Consent or Governmental Authorization has been obtained
prior to the Closing.

(k) With respect to the Canadian Real Property Leases, and Canadian Non-Real
Property Contracts (i) that are, pursuant to the terms of such Canadian Real
Property Lease or Canadian Non-Real Property Contract, assignable by the
relevant Canadian Selling Entity to the Buyer or a Buyer Designee without
first obtaining the Consent of any third party, or (ii) for which the
requisite Consents, as detailed in _Section 2.5(l)_ and _Section 2.5(m)_,
have been obtained (such Contracts as described (i) and (ii) being, in the
case of Canadian Real Property Leases, " _Assumed Canadian Real
Property Leases_ " and, in the case of Canadian Non-Real Property Contracts,
" _Assumed Canadian Agreements_ "), the relevant Canadian Selling Entity shall
assign to the Buyer and/or one or more Buyer Designees such Assumed Canadian
Real Property Leases and Assumed Canadian Agreements upon Closing, and the
Buyer and/or one or more Buyer Designees shall assume such Assumed Canadian
Real Property Leases and Assumed  



 

26  Canadian Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Canadian Selling
Entity may elect to refuse to assign one or more Canadian Real Property Leases
to Buyer or a Buyer Designee if such assignment would result in an increase
in the payments required to be paid, or increase any operating expenses,
required thereunder, _provided_ that any such refusal shall have no effect
on  _Section 8.2(g)_.

(l) With respect to the Canadian Non-Real Property Contracts that are not,
pursuant to the terms of such Canadian Non-Real Property Contract, assignable
by the relevant Canadian Selling Entity to the Buyer or a Buyer Designee
without first obtaining the Consent of any third party, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts prior to Closing to obtain, and to cooperate
in obtaining, all Consents necessary to assign such Canadian Non-Real Property
Contract to the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designees, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that other than the payment of amounts necessary to cure defaults, if any,
and the payment of all actual and pecuniary losses that have resulted from
such defaults, the Selling Entities shall be under no obligation to compromise
any right, asset or benefit or to expend any amount or incur any Liability
in excess of the Consent Cap in seeking such Consents and the obtaining of
any such Consents, in and by itself, is not a condition to the Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent that any
Canadian Non-Real Property Contract is not capable of being assigned to the
Buyer or a Buyer Designee without the Consent of any third party, this
Agreement will not constitute any assignment thereof, or an attempted
assignment, unless any such Consent is obtained. 

(m) With respect to the Canadian Real Property Leases that are not, pursuant
to the terms of such Canadian Real Property Leases, assignable by the
relevant Canadian Selling Entity to the Buyer or a Buyer Designee without
first obtaining the Consent of the relevant landlord or any other third party,
the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to Closing
to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents necessary to assign
such Canadian Real Property Leases to the Buyer and/or any Buyer Designees
(the " _Necessary Canadian Consents_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that other
than the payment of amounts necessary to cure defaults, if any, and the
payment of all actual and pecuniary losses that have resulted from such
defaults, the Selling Entities shall be under no obligation to compromise any
right, asset or benefit or to expend any amount or incur any Liability in
excess of the Consent Cap in seeking such Consents and the failure to obtain
any or all of such Consents, shall not, subject to _Section 8.2(g)_ which
section is unaffected hereby, entitle the Buyer to terminate this Agreement
or fail to complete the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided, further_
, that, even upon reaching the Consent Cap, the Canadian Selling Entities
shall, subject to the last sentence of  _Section 2.5(k)_, continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any remaining Necessary Canadian
Consents. The Buyer acknowledges that (i) it shall not be entitled to request
any amendment to the terms of any Canadian Real Property Lease in connection
with any Consent or approval to be obtained in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the
Seller, which in any event shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, (ii) subject to _Section 7.1(b)(xiii)_, nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Seller or the Canadian Selling Entities in consultation
with Buyer from seeking a reasonable release from any landlord in respect of
any Canadian Real Property Lease, and (iii) subject to _Section 7.1(b)(xiii)_
and _Section 8.2(g)_, it will execute and deliver all acknowledgements and
assumption agreements required by a landlord that are commercially reasonable
or are otherwise contemplated in a Canadian Real Property Lease and shall
provide  



 

27  all necessary certificates of insurance and any other assurances required
under the Canadian Real Property Leases. Without limiting the
Buyers obligations under this _Section 2.5(m)_, the Buyer will forthwith
provide to the Seller and the requisite landlords a copy of materials suitable
for presentation to landlords of the leased premises or any other information
required by any Canadian Real Property Lease, including: (w) a pro forma
balance sheet and income statement of the Buyer showing its estimated assets,
liabilities and equity immediately following Closing, including a reasonable
level of equity in the Buyers capitalization, (x) a description of the
financing structure of the Business after Closing, (y) a description of the
proposed management team for the Business, and (z) any further information
reasonably requested by a particular landlord. To the extent that any
Canadian Real Property Lease is not capable of being assigned to the Buyer or
a Buyer Designee without the consent of any Person, this Agreement will not
constitute any assignment thereof, or an attempted assignment, unless any
such Consent is obtained.

(n) Buyer agrees that each and all of the Assumed Canadian Real Property
Leases shall be assigned to and assumed by either (i) the Buyer or (ii) any
one other Buyer Designee, as chosen by Buyer in its sole discretion.

(o) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any Cure Payments, Consent payments or
payments required to be paid by Seller or any Selling Entity pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ hereof may be paid by (or at the direction of) Seller from
the Purchase Price at Closing as and to the extent authorized by the Sale
Order or the Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order.

Section 2.6 _Allocation_. The Buyer shall, promptly following the final
determination of the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 3.2_, deliver
to the Seller an allocation of the Purchase Price (and the
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under the
Code) among the Purchased Assets and the covenants contained in _Section
7.14_ (the " _Allocation_ ") in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, which Allocation shall be
reasonably acceptable to Seller. The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns
(including the filing of Form 8594 with their United States federal income Tax
Return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing) consistent
with the Allocation unless otherwise required by applicable Law. In
administering the Bankruptcy Case, the Bankruptcy Court shall not be required
to apply the Allocation in determining the manner in which the Purchase Price
should be allocated as between the Domestic Selling Entities and their
respective estates. In administering the CCAA Case, the Canadian Court shall
not be required to apply the Allocation in determining the manner in which
the Purchase Price should be allocated as between the Canadian Selling
Entities and their respective estates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely
for the purposes of the administration of the CCAA Case, the Purchase Price
shall be allocated as between the Canadian Purchased Assets and the other
Purchased Assets prior to the Closing to the extent required in connection
with the CCAA Case and in accordance with applicable Law.

(c) _Review; Disputes_.

(i) The Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Schedule, the Capital Expenditure Schedule and
the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Actual
2009 Capital Expenditures, and in the conduct of the review referred to in
this _Section 3.2_. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Closing until the end of the Review Period, the Buyer shall provide the Seller
and its Representatives with full access to the books, records and employees
of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including any applicable Documentary
Materials and any related work papers of Representatives of Buyer, upon
reasonable notice and during regular business hours for the purposes of
enabling the Seller and its Representatives to calculate, and to review the
Buyers calculation of, the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Actual
2009 Capital Expenditures, and to review Buyers preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Schedule and the Capital Expenditure Schedule.

(ii) If the Seller disputes the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Date Schedule or the Capital Expenditure Schedule, the determination
of any item shown thereon on, or the omission of any item therefrom, or the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount or the Actual 2009
Capital Expenditures, then the Seller shall deliver a written notice
disagreeing with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Date Schedule or the Capital Expenditure Schedule and/or the calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital Amount or the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures
and setting forth the Sellers disagreement with respect thereto (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") to the Buyer at any time during the thirty (30) day period
commencing upon receipt by the Seller of the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Date Schedule and the Capital Expenditure Schedule and the related
certificate from the Buyer, all as prepared by the Buyer in accordance with
the requirements of _Section 3.2(b)_ (with such thirty (30) day period
subject to extension for any failure by Buyer to provide access to Seller and
its Representatives in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)(i)_, the "
_Review Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set forth the basis for the
dispute of any relating calculation, to the extent applicable, in reasonable
detail.

(iii) If the Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the Buyer prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Capital Expenditure Schedule as delivered by the Buyer and the Buyers
calculation of the  



 

30  Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures
set forth in the Closing Date Schedule or the Capital Expenditure Schedule,
as the case may be, shall be deemed final and binding on the Selling Entities
and Buyer for all purposes, except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing
by Seller and Buyer.

(iv) If the Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to the Buyer prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Seller and the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Closing Date Schedule, the Capital Expenditure Schedule, the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, and the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures.
If the Seller and the Buyer are unable to reach agreement on the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Schedule, the Capital Expenditure Schedule,
the Closing Net Working Capital Amount or the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures
within thirty (30) days after the end of the delivery of the Dispute Notice,
the Seller and the Buyer shall refer such dispute to Grant Thornton LLP (the "
_Accountant_ ") for resolution and (A) each of the Buyer and the Seller shall
have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Accountant to provide their
views as to any disputed issues with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Date Schedule, the Capital Expenditure Schedule and the calculation of
any of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Actual 2009 Capital
Expenditures, (B) the Accountant shall determine the final Closing Balance
Sheet, Closing Date Schedule, the Capital Expenditure Schedule, the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount and the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement within thirty (30) days of such
referral and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a copy of the
final Closing Balance Sheet and its calculations of the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount and the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures (the " _Final
Calculations_ ") to the Buyer and the Seller, and (C) the determination made
by the Accountant of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount and the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures shall be
final and binding on the Selling Entities and the Buyer for all purposes of
this Agreement. In preparing the final Closing Balance Sheet and calculating
the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Actual 2009 Capital
Expenditures, the Accountant (x) shall be limited to addressing any particular
disputes referred to in the Dispute Notice and (y) any such calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount or the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures
shall, with respect to any disputed item, be no greater than the higher amount
calculated by the Seller or the Buyer, and no less than the lower amount
calculated by the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be. The Final
Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if any, between the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount reflected therein and the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount set forth in the Closing Date Schedule, or between the
Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures reflected therein and the Actual 2009
Capital Expenditures set forth in the Capital Expenditure Schedule. The
Accountant will determine the allocation of the cost of its review and report
based on the inverse of the percentage its determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the disputed portions of the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Date Schedule, the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Capital Expenditure Schedule and the Actual 2009 Capital
Expenditures as originally submitted to the Accountant. For example, should
the disputed portions total in amount to $1,000 and the Accountant awards $600
in favor of the Sellers position, 60% of the costs of its review would be
borne by the Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Seller.



 

31 (d) _Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments_.

(i) If (A) the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is greater than (B) the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.2(c)_, by an amount greater than $1,000,000, then the Seller shall
pay (or cause to be paid) to the Buyer, an amount equal to the difference
between the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount (from dollar one) (the " _Seller Adjustment Payment_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, no payment shall be made by the Seller to the Buyer
pursuant to this clause (i) in the event that such difference is not greater
than $1,000,000.

(ii) If (A) the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, is greater than (B) the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount, by an amount greater than $1,000,000, then the Buyer
shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Seller an amount equal to the
difference between the Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount (from dollar one) (the " _Buyer Adjustment Payment_
"). For the avoidance of doubt, no payment shall be made by the Buyer to the
Seller pursuant to this clause (ii) in the event that such difference is not
greater than $1,000,000.

(iii) If (A) the finally determined Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures are
greater than the Estimated Capital Expenditures and (B) the Capital
Expenditure Target exceeds the finally determined Actual 2009 Capital
Expenditures by less than $2,500,000, then the Buyer shall pay (or cause to
be paid) to the Seller an amount, if any, equal to (1) if the difference
between the Capital Expenditure Target and the Estimated Capital Expenditures
is greater than $2,500,000, (x) $2,500,000 _minus_  (y) the difference
between the Capital Expenditure Target and the Actual 2009 Capital
Expenditures, or (2) if the difference between the Capital Expenditure Target
and the Estimated Capital Expenditures is less than $2,500,000, the lesser of
(x) the finally determined Actual 2009 Capital Expenditure minus the Estimated
Capital Expenditures or (y) the amount of the Estimated Capital Expenditure
Adjustment (such amount, the " _Buyer Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount_
"). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Capital Expenditure Target exceeds the
finally determined Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures by more than $2,500,000
there shall not be any amount payable by the Buyer pursuant to this _Section
3.2(d)(iii)_.

(iv) If the finally determined Actual 2009 Capital Expenditures are less than
the Estimated Capital Expenditures, then the Seller shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to the Buyer an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the difference between
the Estimated Capital Expenditures and the finally determined Actual
2009 Capital Expenditures or (B) $2,500,000 _minus_ the Estimated Capital
Expenditure Adjustment (such lesser amount, the " _Seller Capital Expenditure
Adjustment Amount_ " and, the Seller Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount
or the Buyer Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount, as applicable, the "
_Final Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount_ ").

(v) Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.2(d)_ shall be paid in
cash within two (2) Business Days following the final determination of the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount or the Actual 2009 Capital Expenditure, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Seller or Buyer, as applicable.



 

32 (e) _Treatment as Administrative Expenses_. Any amounts at any time payable
under this  _Section 3.2_ shall be deemed allowed administrative claims in
the Bankruptcy Case of any Selling Entity that is a debtor, with priority over
any and all claims of the kind specified in 11 U.S.C. §§ 503(b) and 507(b)
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 364(c)(1), which claim shall be senior to, and have
priority over, all other claims other than any claims arising under the DIP
Facility.

Section 3.3 _Deposit Escrow_. Within four Business Days following the Petition
Date, the Seller and the Buyer shall enter into an escrow agreement
substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), with
such changes thereto as may be reasonably acceptable to the Seller and to the
Buyer, with an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to the Seller and the Buyer
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), and the Buyer shall deposit into escrow with the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to $5,057,500 (such amount, together with any
interest accrued thereon prior to the Closing Date, the " _Deposit_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Deposit shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any of the Selling
Entities or the Buyer. The Deposit shall become payable to the Seller upon
the earlier of (a) the Closing, or (b) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ (a " _Buyer Default Termination_ "). At the
Closing, the Deposit shall be delivered to an account designated by the
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds as payment of a portion
of the Purchase Price and the Closing Payment. In the event the Deposit
becomes payable to the Seller by reason of a Buyer Default Termination,
the Escrow Agent shall, within two (2) Business Days after receiving notice
of such Buyer Default Termination from Seller, disburse the Deposit to an
account designated by the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to be retained by the Seller for its own account. If this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated herein are terminated other than for a
termination which constitutes a Buyer Default Termination, the Seller and the
Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to, and the Escrow Agent shall, within
two (2) Business Days after such instruction, return to the Buyer the Deposit
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Escrow Agents escrow
fees and charges shall be paid by the Buyer.

Section 3.4 _Withholding_. The Buyer shall be entitled to withhold, and shall
withhold, from any amount otherwise payable to any of the Selling Entities
under this Agreement any withholding Taxes required by applicable Tax Law to
be withheld from the amounts so payable. Any amount so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority pursuant to this _Section
3.4_ shall be deemed to have been paid over to the applicable Selling
Entities for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Buyer determines that it
is required to withhold from any amount payable to any of the Selling Entities
under this Agreement, it will notify the Seller at least ten (10) days prior
to such payment and will work in good faith with the Seller and the
appropriate Selling Entities to eliminate or minimize such withholding.

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no Person has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, or is infringing,

Proceedings currently ongoing or pending with respect to any Taxes of any
Selling Entity, any Acquired Subsidiary or, to the Sellers Knowledge, the
Japanese JV, subject to exceptions for Legal Proceedings that, if resolved in

Entity, Acquired Subsidiary or the Japanese JV does not file Tax Returns

claim, if successfully asserted, could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability for Taxes.

to offer, to employ all or substantially all Current Employees with
employment commencing as of the Closing and (ii) the Buyer shall be entitled,
but not obligated, to elect, in writing, to assume any Canadian Benefit Plan
as of the Closing; _provided_ that the Buyer shall fully perform
its obligations under each such assumed Canadian Benefit Plan from and after
the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, each Current Employee who
receives such an offer of employment shall be referred to as an "Offeree". At
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer will
provide the Seller with a schedule setting forth a list of the names of all
Offerees. Each Offeree who accepts such offer prior to the Closing shall be
referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ". Except to the extent the
Selling Entities fail to comply in any material respects with _Section
7.7(c)(i)_ and _Section 7.7(c)(iii)_, the Buyer hereby agrees that the offer
to an Offeree shall include a level of base salary, wages and benefit
eligibility that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base
salary, wages and benefit eligibility provided to such Offeree by the Selling
Entities as of the Closing Date;  _provided_ , that, for purposes of the
foregoing comparison, equity or equity-based compensation and eligibility to
participate in any defined benefit pension plan and retiree medical plan shall
be excluded; and _provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes of the foregoing
comparison the level of long-term disability benefit eligibility provided by
the Selling Entities to an Offeree who is on short-term disability as of the
Closing Date will be deemed equal to the long-term disability benefits that
could be purchased by Buyer at a cost that is comparable to the amount the
applicable Selling Entity pays for such long-term disability benefits coverage
provided to such Offeree (and not the level of benefits provided to such
Offeree). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall be exclusively liable
for any claims related to discrimination that arise solely from Buyers
actions taken in selecting any Offerees.



 

58 (b) Each Current Employee of the Selling Entities or any of their Affiliates
who is not a Transferred Employee shall be referred to herein as an "
_Excluded Employee_." To the extent Buyer elects under _Section 7.7(a)(ii)_
to assume any Canadian Benefit Plan, the Selling Entities shall cause those
Excluded Employees who participate in such Canadian Benefit Plan to cease
participation in such plan no later than the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(c) Following the date of this Agreement,

(i) the Selling Entities shall allow the Buyer or any applicable
Buyer Designee reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice to meet with
and interview the Current Employees who are members of executive management
and other employees reasonably requested during normal business hours;
_provided, however_ , that such access shall not unduly interfere with the
operation of the Business prior to the Closing;

(ii) the Selling Entities shall not, nor shall any Selling Entity authorize
or direct or give express permission to any Affiliate, officer, director, or
employee of any Selling Entity or any Affiliate to (A) interfere with Buyers
or any Buyer Designees rights under _Section 7.7(a)_ to make offers of
employment to any Offeree, or (B) solicit or encourage any Offeree not to
accept, or to reject, any such offer of employment; and

(iii) the Selling Entities shall provide reasonable cooperation and
information to Buyer or the relevant Buyer Designee as reasonably requested
by Buyer or such Buyer Designee with respect to its determination of
appropriate terms and conditions of employment for any Offeree.

(d) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall process the payroll for, and pay
(or cause to be paid), the base wages, base salary and ordinary course sales
commissions accrued during the payroll period in which the Closing Date falls
(the " _Closing Payroll Period_ ") with respect to each Transferred Employee;
_provided_ , that an amount sufficient to satisfy such obligations has been
accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet. The Buyer shall withhold and remit
all applicable payroll taxes as required by Law for the Closing Payroll
Period.

(e) As of the Closing, the Buyer shall credit each Transferred Employee with
the unused and outstanding vacation, sick days, personal days or leave earned
and/or accrued by each Transferred Employee from the Selling Entities through
Closing pursuant to the Seller Benefit Plans that are paid time off plans
and policies; _provided_ , that no later than three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Selling Entities shall provide to the Buyer a schedule
setting forth all relevant accruals for each applicable Offeree. In addition,
Transferred Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and
eligibility to receive benefits) under any employee benefit plan, policy and
arrangement established or maintained by the Buyer or a Buyer Designee after
the Closing (the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") under which each Transferred
Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing to the same
extent recognized by the Selling Entities under comparable Seller Benefit
Plans as of the date hereof; _provided,_ that, subject to applicable Law,
Transferred  



 

59  Employees shall not receive the foregoing credit for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive
benefits with respect to any defined benefit pension plan; _provided,
further_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit. To the extent the Buyer does not
elect under  _Section 7.7(a)(ii)_ to assume any Canadian Benefit Plan, the
Selling Entities shall recognize, to the extent required by any Law, the
period of employment of each Transferred Employee with the Buyer or any
applicable Buyer Designee for the purposes of determining entitlement to
benefits under such Canadian Benefit Plan. With respect to any Buyer Benefit
Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement and in which a
Transferred Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing,
the Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Buyer Designee to, (i) waive,
or use reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all
limitations as to pre-existing, waiting period or actively-at-
work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Transferred Employee under such Buyer Benefit
Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Seller Benefit Plan and (ii)
provide credit to each Transferred Employee (and such Transferred Employees
beneficiaries) for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by such Transferred Employee (and such Transferred Employees
beneficiaries) under the comparable Seller Benefit Plan during the relevant
plan year, up to and including the Closing; _provided, however_ , that such
credit shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit.

(f) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall assume the Liabilities of the
Selling Entities under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended and Section 4980B of the Code (" _COBRA_ ") (and any
comparable state law) solely with respect to each individual who, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, is an "MandA Qualified Beneficiary" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 QandA4(a), (b) and (c), each as applicable);
_provided_ , that Buyers obligations under this _Section 7.7(f)_
shall solely relate to any such Liabilities under COBRA arising on and after
the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may satisfy its obligations under the preceding sentence in any
manner it chooses, including by establishing or making changes to the terms
and conditions of any Buyer Benefit Plan which is a "group health plan" (as
defined in Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code), in accordance with COBRA. No
later than two (2) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the
Selling Entities shall take all necessary actions to rescind any actions taken
by any of the Selling Entities to terminate its group health plan(s) covering
retirees of the Selling Entities (and any predecessor). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the Selling Entities
shall continue to maintain their group health plan(s) on the same terms and
conditions as in effect on the date of this Agreement (after giving effect to
the immediately preceding sentence) up until the Closing and (ii) effective as
of the Closing, the Selling Entities shall terminate each group health plan
that any of them sponsors or maintains.

(g) Subject to the Selling Entities compliance with _Section 7.7(i)_, with
respect to the Selling Entities facilities located in Bellevue, Washington,
Westmont, Illinois and Groveport, Ohio, the Buyer shall provide offers of
employment to a sufficient number of Offerees at each such site of employment
such that the Selling Entities shall not have any Liabilities under the WARN
Act with respect to any such site of employment.



 

60 (h) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and neither the
Selling Entities nor any of their Affiliates shall take any affirmative
action that would have the effect of requiring the Buyer or any applicable
Buyer Designee to continue any specific employee benefit plan or to continue
the employment of any specific person. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to establish, create or amend, nor shall anything in this Agreement be
construed as establishing, creating or amending, any employee benefit plan,
practice or program of the Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any Seller Benefit
Plan, nor shall anything in this Agreement create or be construed as creating
any contract of employment or as conferring upon any Transferred Employee or
upon any other person, other than the parties to this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, any rights to enforce any provisions of this Agreement under
ERISA or otherwise.

(i) As soon as practicable after the date hereof but no later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Entities shall provide
Buyer with a list setting forth the number of Former Employees terminated
during the ninety (90) day period ending on the Closing Date (which list
shall include Current Employees whose employment the Selling Entities and
their Affiliates reasonably expect to terminate between the date such list is
provided and the Closing Date) from each site of employment of the Selling
Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary for reasons qualifying the termination
as (a) "employment losses" under the WARN Act or (b) a "collective redundancy"
or similar process (being a process under any foreign Law under which
an employer is required by Law to follow a different process for the
termination of more than one employee when compared with the process for the
termination of one employee), and the date of each such termination with
respect to each termination;  _provided_ , _however_ , that solely with
respect to any jurisdiction in which the WARN Act is applicable, this sentence
shall not apply with respect to any site of employment at which sufficient
employees have not been employed at any time in such ninety (90) day period
for termination of employment at such site to be subject to the WARN Act.

Section 7.8 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Any sales, use, value added, property transfer, documentary, stamp,
registration, recording or similar Tax payable in connection with the sale or
transfer of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
and not exempted under the Sale Order or by Section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the
Selling Entities; _provided_ that, for administrative convenience, Buyer shall
pay all Transfer Taxes and the Selling Entities shall bear their 50% of the
Transfer Taxes via the deduction of 50% of the Transfer Taxes in clause (iii)
of the definition of Closing Net Working Capital Amount, as Closing Net
Working Capital is finally determined in accordance with _Section 3.2
_hereof. The Selling Entities and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the
sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets from any such Transfer Taxes, and
for greater certainty, the Buyer Designee that will acquire the assets of the
Canadian Selling Entities and the Canadian Selling Entities shall jointly
elect under subsection 167(1) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada), and if
applicable, any equivalent section of provincial legislation, such that no tax
shall be collectible by the Selling Entities pursuant to Part IX of the
Excise Tax Act (Canada) or any provincial value-added tax legislation. Buyer
shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns or other documents with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted under applicable
Tax Law. 



 

61 (b) All real property, personal property and other ad valorem Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Assets that are due after the Closing Date shall be
paid by the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer
shall be entitled to assume control of any appeal with respect to any property
tax Liability ongoing as of the Closing Date; provided that the Buyer
consults with the Selling Entities regarding any such appeal and keeps the
Selling Entities reasonably informed on a timely basis with respect to the
progress of, and any material developments with respect to, any such appeal.

(c) The Buyer agrees to furnish or cause to be furnished to the Seller and
Sellers Representatives, upon request and at Sellers sole cost and expense,
as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of Tax Returns, the making of any election relating
to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or Legal Proceeding relating to any
Tax; and _provided_ that any payment or reimbursement to Buyer in connection
with its furnishing of any such information or assistance shall be at a rate
equal to the actual out-of-pocket expense incurred by Buyer or the applicable
Buyer Designee in connection therewith. Such information and assistance shall
include providing reasonable access to all of the books and records of the
Selling Entities, the Acquired Subsidiary and the Japanese JV delivered to
the Buyer or any Buyer Designee at Closing or provided pursuant to _Section
7.2(b)_, and shall include providing reasonable access to, and the assistance
of, the employees of the Buyer and the Buyer Designee and to the assets,
software and systems of the Buyer and the Buyer Designees; _provided_ that
such access or assistance does not interfere in any material respect with the
operation of the Business following the Closing. From and after the Closing
and until the dissolution and liquidation of the Selling Entities, the Selling
Entities agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the Buyer and Buyers
Representatives, upon request and at Buyers sole cost and expense, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of Tax Returns, the making of any election relating
to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or Legal Proceeding relating to
any Tax. Access to books and records shall be afforded upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Nothing in this
_Section 7.8(c)_ shall (i) require the Selling Entities to make any
expenditure or incur any obligation on behalf of themselves or the Buyer, or
(ii) prohibit any Selling Entity from ceasing operations or winding up its
affairs following the Closing. 

(d) The Buyer Designee that will acquire the assets of the Canadian Selling
Entities hereunder and each of the Canadian Selling Entities will execute and
file a joint election under Section 22 of the Tax Act and under the
corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial Tax legislation, within
the prescribed time periods, in respect of the Accounts Receivable to which
such elections may apply and shall designate an amount equal to the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to such assets as the consideration paid by
the Buyer therefor.

(e) The Buyer Designee that will acquire the assets of the Canadian Selling
Entities hereunder and each of the Canadian Selling Entities shall jointly
elect to have the rules in subsection 20(24) of the Tax Act, and any
equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial Tax
legislation, apply to the obligations of each of the Canadian Selling Entities
in respect of undertakings which arise from the operation of their respective
business and to which paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Tax Act applies and shall
agree upon a reasonable amount for  



 

62  the purposes of each such election and shall file each such election within
the prescribed time. The Buyer Designee that will acquire the assets of
the Canadian Selling Entities hereunder and each of the Canadian Selling
Entities acknowledge that the Canadian Selling Entities, respectively, are
transferring assets to such Buyer Designee which have a value equal to such
reasonable amounts as consideration for the assumption by such Buyer Designee
of such obligations.

(f) To the extent required by law, forthwith after execution of this
Agreement the Canadian Selling Entities will apply to the appropriate
Governmental Authority and deliver to the Buyer, forthwith after receipt
thereof, duplicate copies of certificates issued pursuant to section 6 of the
Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario) and equivalent certificates issued under any
similar legislation of any province in which the Canadian Selling Entities
carry on business or have a fixed place of business, in connection with the
completion of the transactions provided in this Agreement; _provided_ that
the Canadian Selling Entities shall not be required to provide any such
certificates in any applicable province or jurisdiction to the extent that the
Buyer or any Buyer Designee would not be subject to successor liability under
such legislation in such jurisdiction or province, or as a result of any
Canadian Law or the entry of the Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order; and
further _provided_ that the Canadian Selling Entities shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to deliver any such required certificates at or
before Closing.

(g) The Buyer Designee that will acquire the assets of the Canadian Selling
Entities hereunder will, at the Closing, be registered under Subdivision d of
Division V of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and will be assigned
GST/HST Numbers which will be disclosed to the Canadian Selling Entities
at or prior to the Closing.

(h) The Buyer and Buyer Designees on the one hand and the Selling Entities on
the other hand shall use their commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate
in good faith to minimize the application of section 56.4 of the Tax Act to
the transactions hereunder.

Section 7.9 _Submission for Bankruptcy Court Approval and Canadian Court
Approval_.

(a) Each of the Selling Entities shall file the Petitions no later than the
close of business on the first (1st) Business Day following the date of this
Agreement. On the Petition Date (or in any event within two (2) Business
Days thereafter), the Selling Entities shall file a motion or motions in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer (the " _Motions_ ") and supporting
papers seeking (i) the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order (including the
scheduling of the Auction), (ii) the Bankruptcy Courts approval of this
Agreement, each Selling Entitys performance under this Agreement and the
assumption and the assignment of the Assumed Agreements and the Assumed Real
Property Leases pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, (iii) the
entry of the Vendor Support Order, and (iv) the entry of the Sale Order, and
the Selling Entities shall provide the Buyer with a copy of such documents
promptly thereof. The Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order may, at the
Sellers option, be sought under one combined set of motion papers. All of the
Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Bankruptcy Court enter the Bidding Procedures Order within twenty (20) days
following the filing of the motion therefor, to have the Sale Hearing no later
than fifty (50) days after the Petition Date and to have the Sale Order
entered as a Final Order no  



 

63  later than eleven (11) days after the conclusion of the Sale Hearing. The
Selling Entities shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to have
the Bankruptcy Court enter the Vendor Support Order as soon as practicable
after the Petition Date. The Selling Entities shall give notice under the
Bankruptcy Code of the request for the relief specified in the Motions to all
Persons entitled to such notice, including all Persons that have asserted
Encumbrances in the Purchased Assets, the PBGC and all non-debtor parties to
the Assumed Agreements and the Assumed Real Property Leases, and other
appropriate notice, including such additional notice as the Bankruptcy Court
shall direct or as the Buyer may reasonably request, and provide appropriate
opportunity for hearing, to all parties entitled thereto, of all motions,
orders, hearings, or other Legal Proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Selling
Entities shall be responsible for making all appropriate filings relating
thereto with the Bankruptcy Court, which filings shall be submitted, to the
extent practicable, to the Buyer prior to their filing with the Bankruptcy
Court for the Buyers prior review.

(b) As promptly as possible, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the Motions are filed, the Canadian Selling Entities shall bring an
application in the Canadian Court or other applicable court under the CCAA
seeking an order (i) declaring that the Canadian Selling Entities are
companies to which the CCAA applies, (ii) implementing any requisite debtor-
in-possession financing, and (iii) granting certain other customary relief
granted to debtor companies under the CCAA, including a stay of proceedings
in respect of the Canadian Selling Entities (as approved, the " _Canadian
Initial Order_ "). As promptly as possible, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order as a Final
Order and on not less than 10 days notice to Persons designated by the Buyer,
including without limitation the PBGC, the Canadian Selling Entities shall
bring a motion in the Canadian Court in the CCAA Case seeking an order
approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and
approving the Bidding Procedures as they relate to the Canadian Selling
Entities and approving this Agreement as a stalking horse Agreement (as
approved, the " _Canadian Bidding Procedures Order_ "). As promptly as
possible, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the entry of
the Sale Order, the Canadian Selling Entities shall bring a motion in the
Canadian Court in the CCAA Case seeking an order vesting the Canadian
Purchased Assets in the Buyer and/or the Buyer Designees free and clear of all
claims, liens and encumbrances whatsoever (other than permitted encumbrances
identified in the Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order), which
order shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (as
approved, the " _Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order_ ").

(c) A list of the Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property Leases shall be
filed as an exhibit to the Sale Motion (or, if required by the Bankruptcy
Court, a motion to assume and assign the Assumed Agreements and the Assumed
Real Property Leases), and shall be described in sufficient detail to provide
adequate notice to the non-debtor parties to such Contracts. Upon designation
or removal by the Buyer of the Assumed Agreements and the Assumed Real
Property Leases in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_, the Seller shall add
any Assumed Agreements or Assumed Real Property Leases, respectively, to such
exhibit to the Sale Motion or remove any Assumed Agreements or Assumed Real
Property Leases (other than Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property
Leases designated for assumption pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)_) from such
exhibit, as applicable. Such exhibit shall set forth the amounts necessary to
cure defaults under each Assumed Agreement and Assumed Real Property Lease
shown thereon, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Seller. In cases
in which the Seller is unable to establish that a default exists, the relevant
cure amount shall be set at $0.00. 



 

64 (d) Each Selling Entity and the Buyer shall consult with one another regarding
pleadings which any of them intends to file with the Bankruptcy Court or the
Canadian Court in connection with, or which might reasonably affect the
Bankruptcy Courts or the Canadian Courts approval of, as applicable, the
Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order, the Vendor Support Order, the
Canadian Initial Order, the Canadian Bidding Procedures Order or the Canadian
Sale Approval and Vesting Order. Each Selling Entity shall promptly provide
the Buyer and its counsel with copies of all notices, filings and orders of
the Bankruptcy Court or the Canadian Court that such Selling Entity has in its
possession (or receives) pertaining to the motion for approval of the Bidding
Procedures Order, the Sale Order, the Vendor Support Order, the Canadian
Initial Order, the Canadian Bidding Procedures Order or the Canadian Sale
Approval and Vesting Order or any other order related to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but only to the extent such
papers are not publicly available on the docket of the Bankruptcy Court or
otherwise made available to the Buyer and its counsel, including on the
website of the Monitor.

(e) If the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order, the Vendor Support Order,
the Canadian Initial Order, the Canadian Bidding Procedures Order, the
Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order or any other orders of the Bankruptcy
Court or the Canadian Court relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be appealed by any Person (or if any petition for
certiorari or motion for reconsideration, amendment, clarification,
modification, vacation, stay, rehearing or reargument shall be filed with
respect to the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order, the Vendor Support
Order, the Canadian Initial Order, the Canadian Bidding Procedures Order, the
Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order or other such order), subject to
rights otherwise arising from this Agreement, the Selling Entities, the
Acquired Subsidiary and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to prosecute such appeal, petition or motion and obtain an
expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion.

Section 7.10 _Overbid Procedures; Adequate Assurance_.

(a) The Selling Entities and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement and the
sale of the Purchased Assets are subject to higher and better bids
and Bankruptcy Court and Canadian Court approval. The Buyer and the Selling
Entities acknowledge that the Selling Entities must take reasonable steps to
demonstrate that they have sought to obtain the highest or otherwise best
price for the Purchased Assets, including giving notice thereof to the
creditors of the Selling Entities and other interested parties, providing
information about the Selling Entities business to prospective bidders,
entertaining higher and better offers from such prospective bidders, and, in
the event that additional qualified prospective bidders desire to bid for the
Purchased Assets, conducting an auction (the " _Auction_ ").

(b) The bidding procedures to be employed with respect to this Agreement and
any Auction shall be those reflected in the Bidding Procedures Order and
the Canadian Bidding Procedures Order. Buyer agrees to be bound by and accept
the terms and conditions of the Bidding Procedures as approved by the
Bankruptcy Court and the Canadian Court. Buyer  



 

65  agrees and acknowledges that the Selling Entities and their Affiliates and
the Sellers Representatives are and may continue soliciting
inquiries, proposals or offers for the Purchased Assets in connection with
any alternative transaction pursuant to the terms of the Bidding Procedures
Order and agrees and acknowledges that the bidding procedures contained in the
Bidding Procedures Order may be supplemented by other customary procedures
not inconsistent with the matters otherwise set forth therein and the terms of
this Agreement.

(c) Buyer shall provide adequate assurance as required under the Bankruptcy
Code of the future performance by Buyer or any applicable Buyer Designee of
each Assumed Agreement and each Assumed Real Property Lease. Buyer agrees that
it will, and will cause its Affiliates to, promptly take all actions
reasonably required to assist in obtaining a Bankruptcy Court finding that
there has been an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of future
performance under the Assumed Agreements and the Assumed Real Property
Leases, such as furnishing affidavits, non-confidential financial information
and other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and
making Buyers Representatives available to testify before the Bankruptcy
Court. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer
shall, or shall cause any applicable Buyer Designee to, from and after the
Closing Date, (i) assume all Liabilities of the Selling Entities under
the Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property Leases and (ii) satisfy and
perform all of the Liabilities related to each of the Assumed Agreements and
each Assumed Real Property Lease when the same are due thereunder.

(d) The Selling Entities and the Buyer agree, and the motion to approve the
Bidding Procedures Order shall reflect the fact, that the provisions of
this Agreement, including this _Section 7.10_ and _Section 7.11_, are
reasonable, were a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and are designed to achieve the highest and best price for the
Purchased Assets. 

Section 7.11 _Termination Fee_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ other than
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ and the Seller consummates either (i) an
Alternative Transaction, or (ii) a Restructuring Transaction or any other
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Selling Entities or of
the Purchased Assets to a Person (or group of Persons) other than the Buyer or
an Affiliate of the Buyer on or prior to the date that is twelve months after
the date of such termination and the aggregate cash price paid by such third-
party acquirer in any such Alternative Transaction, Restructuring Transaction
or other sale transaction is equal to or greater than
$208,500,000 (disregarding any post-closing adjustments to purchase price),
the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the Termination Fee on the day such
Alternative Transaction, Restructuring Transaction or other sale is
consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such the Termination Fee shall
be payable to the Buyer by reason of any Selling Entity consummating a plan of
reorganization under which the Selling Entities secured lenders as of the
date of this Agreement receive substantially all of the equity interests
issued by the reorganized Selling Entity or a credit bid by any of the Selling
Entities secured lenders.

(b) In the event that the Seller proposes to consummate a transaction of the
type described in _Section 7.11(a)(ii_) (other than a non-going concern
liquidation of the Selling Entities in connection with which all or
substantially all of the proceeds are distributed to  



 

66  creditors in such liquidation) on or prior to the date that is twelve months
after the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1 _(other than pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_), but the aggregate cash price
to be paid by the third-party acquirer in such transaction is less than
$208,500,000 (disregarding any post-closing adjustments to purchase price)
(any such transaction, a " _ROFO Option Transaction_ "), then the Seller may
elect, at its option, (i) to pay to the Buyer the Termination Fee on the day
such ROFO Option Transaction is consummated, or (ii) to provide to the Buyer
a right of first-offer prior to the consummation of such ROFO Option
Transaction, in which case the Seller shall provide the Buyer with an Offer
Notice and, for ten (10) Business Days following the Buyers receipt of such
Offer Notice (the " _Offer Period_ "), the Buyer shall have the option to
deliver a reply notice (the " _Reply Notice_ ") to the Seller setting forth
the irrevocable election of the Buyer to require the Seller to consummate such
ROFO Option Transaction with the Buyer for a cash purchase price
(disregarding any post-closing adjustments to purchase price) that is equal to
the cash purchase price offered by the third-party acquirer (disregarding any
post-closing adjustments to purchase price) and otherwise substantially on
the same terms and conditions as the proposed ROFO Option Transaction with the
third-party acquirer (including any post-closing adjustments to purchase
price). In the event that the Seller elects to offer the Buyer a right of
first offer and the Buyer delivers a Reply Notice within the Offer Period, the
Buyer and the Seller shall execute and deliver such additional documents and
use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such further action as may be
necessary or appropriate to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, such transaction. The failure by the Buyer to
deliver a Reply Notice to the Seller within the Offer Period shall be deemed
to be a waiver by the Buyer of its first-offer rights under this _Section
7.11(b)_.

(c) The Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Buyer.

(d) The claim of the Buyer in respect of the Termination Fee shall constitute
a super-priority administrative expense claim, senior to all other
administrative expense claims of the Selling Entities other than any claims
arising under the DIP Facility, as administrative expenses under Sections 503
and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Case.

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in 
_Section 7.3_ and this _Section 7.11_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is
not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the Buyer in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Section 7.12 _Transfer of Purchased Assets; Substitution of Letters of
Credit_.

(a) The Buyer will make all necessary arrangements for the Buyer or a Buyer
Designee to take possession of the Purchased Assets, and, at the Buyers
expense, to transfer same to a location operated by the Buyer or a Buyer
Designee, to the extent necessary, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing.



 

67 (b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, (i)
replace any letters of credit, bankers acceptance or similar credit
transaction that secure any Assumed Liabilities of any Selling Entity relating
to the Business and (ii) cause such letters of credit, bankers acceptance or
similar credit transaction to be released and returned to the Seller.

(c) Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.5(k)_, the Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to duly make all notifications and comply
with all the applicable consent or other requirements under the Canadian Real
Property Leases arising in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby whether such notifications are due or such other actions need to be
taken prior to or after the Closing, subject, to the extent applicable, to the
Consent Cap.

Section 7.13 _Post-Closing Operation of the Seller; Name Changes_. The Seller
hereby acknowledges and agrees that upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Buyer and/or each Buyer Designee shall have the sole
right to the use of the name "Eddie Bauer" or similar names or any service
marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems or signs
containing or comprising the foregoing, including any name or mark
confusingly similar thereto. After the Closing Date, none of the Selling
Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates shall use the name or mark
"Eddie Bauer" or any derivatives thereof for commercial purposes and shall
only use the same for administrative purposes while subject to the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and the Canadian Court. The Sale Order
shall provide for the modification of the caption in the proceedings before
the Bankruptcy Court to reflect the change in the name of Seller, except that
during the pendency of such proceedings, Seller shall be permitted to use the
name "EBHI Holdings, Inc." as its corporate name in connection with matters
relating to the Bankruptcy Case and as a former name for legal and noticing
purposes, but for no other commercial purpose. After the Closing, the Selling
Entities and their Affiliates shall promptly file with the applicable
Governmental Authorities all documents reasonably necessary to delete from
their names the words "Eddie Bauer" or any derivatives thereof and shall do
or cause to be done all other acts, including the payment of any fees required
in connection therewith, to cause such documents to become effective as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

Section 7.14 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

(a) For a period from the Closing until the earlier of the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date and the dissolution and liquidation of
the Selling Entities, each Selling Entity shall not directly or indirectly,
own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the design, sourcing, distribution
or sale through retail stores, outlet stores or catalogs of mens, womens or
childrens outwear, apparel, accessories and sporting equipment or that
otherwise competes with the Business (a " _Restricted Business_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions contained in this _Section
7.14(a)_ shall not restrict the acquisition by a Selling Entity or any of its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of less than 2% of the outstanding
capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business.
The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law
for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that the Buyer, in
addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary
and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage
or posting any bond whatsoever.



 

68 (b) For a period from the Closing to the earlier of the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date and the dissolution and liquidation of the
Selling Entities, each Selling Entity shall not: (i) cause, solicit, induce or
encourage any Current Employees of any Selling Entity or Acquired Subsidiary
who are or become employees of the Buyer or a Buyer Designee to leave such
employment or (ii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or
prospective client, customer, supplier, or licensor of the Business (including
any existing or former customer of a Selling Entity or Acquired Subsidiary
and any Person that becomes a client or customer of the Business after the
Closing) or any other Person who has a material business relationship with the
Business, to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship
with the Buyer (but taking into account, in each case, the fact that the
Bankruptcy Case have commenced and that, following the Closing, the Selling
Entities intend to dissolve and liquidate and, as a result thereof, may
reject, terminate or cease any remaining relationships with any other
Persons).

(c) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 7.14_ relate
to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 7.14_ will cause irreparable
injury to the Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore, the Buyer
will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief
from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this
_Section 7.14_. The rights and remedies provided by this _Section 7.14_ are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Buyer
may have hereunder or at law or in equity. Each of Buyer and Seller agree that
if any portion of the Purchase Price or the Closing Payment is allocated to
this _Section 7.14_ pursuant to _Section 2.6_ or otherwise, such allocated
portion shall be de minimis.

(d) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a
final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period,
a specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other
relevant feature of this _Section 7.14_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against
public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined to be reasonable,
not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the
applicable party.

Section 7.15 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, the Selling
Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary shall satisfy in full all intercompany
accounts payable (or other amounts payable) and other intercompany
obligations of any Selling Entity owed by it to the Acquired Subsidiary or of
the Acquired Subsidiary owed by it to any Selling Entity with effect prior to
or on the Closing Date. All costs, expenses and other Liabilities incurred
in connection with the termination and satisfaction of such intercompany
obligations shall be paid or borne by the Selling Entities, and the Buyer
shall have no responsibility therefor.

Section 7.16 _Damage or Destruction_. Until the Closing, the Purchased Assets
shall remain at the risk of the Selling Entities. In the event of any
material damage to or destruction of any of the Purchased Asset listed on
_Schedule 7.16_ after the date hereof and prior to the Closing (in any such
case, a " _Damage or Destruction Loss_ "), the Seller shall give
notice thereof to the Buyer. If any such Damage or Destruction Loss is
covered by policies of insurance and is not repaired or replaced by a similar
facility in reasonable proximity to any former facility, all right  



 

69  and claim of the Selling Entities to any proceeds of insurance for such
Damage or Destruction Loss shall be assigned and (if previously received by
the Selling Entities and not used prior to the Closing Date to repair any
damage or destruction) paid to the Buyer and/or a Buyer Designee at Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.1(q)_. If any such Damage or Destruction Loss is
not covered by policies of insurance (not considering any deductible payable
with respect to any policy of insurance), the Buyer shall have the right to
reduce the Closing Payment by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
estimated cost to repair or restore the Purchased Assets affected by such
Damage or Destruction Loss (the " _Affected Assets_ ") to substantially the
same condition that existed immediately prior to the occurrence of such Damage
or Destruction Loss, or (ii) if such Affected Assets are destroyed or damaged
beyond repair or are not able to be repaired to substantially the same
condition that existed prior to such Damage or Destruction Loss at a cost less
than their replacement cost, the replacement cost of the Affected Assets for
a similar facility in reasonable proximity to the former facility, and the
amount of the Closing Payment reduction on account of such Damage or
Destruction Loss shall be retained by the Sellers. If the Buyer elects to
reduce the Closing Payment pursuant to this _Section 7.16_, the Seller and
the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon the amount
of such reduction. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within five
(5) Business Days after notice of the Damage or Destruction Loss is given by
the Selling Entities, then the amount of the reduction shall be determined by
an independent, qualified insurance adjuster selected by the Parties (or, if
they are unable to agree on such selection, one appointed by the Bankruptcy
Court upon application of either Party).

Section 7.17 _Permits_. Commencing on the date of this Agreement, the
Parties, cooperating in good faith and, at Buyers sole cost and expense for
out-of-pocket expenses, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
steps, including the filing of any required applications with Governmental
Authorities, as may be necessary (i) to effect the transfer of Permits that
are Purchased Assets to the Buyer on or as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, to the extent such transfer is permissible under
applicable Law, and (ii) to enable the Buyer to obtain, on or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, any additional licenses, permits,
approvals, consents, certificates, registrations, and authorizations (whether
governmental, regulatory, or otherwise) as may be necessary for the lawful
operation of the Business from and after the Closing Date.

Section 7.18 _Suppliers; Certain Avoidance Actions; Policies Regarding
Personally Identifiable Information; Insurance Policies; Employment
Arrangements_.

(a) The Selling Entities shall, and shall cause the Acquired Subsidiary to,
promptly following the request thereof by the Buyer, seek and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to arrange such meetings and
telephone conferences with material suppliers of the Selling Entities and the
Acquired Subsidiary as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer and necessary
and appropriate for the Buyer to coordinate transition of such suppliers with
the Business following the Closing; provided that Representatives of Seller
shall be entitled to attend and participate in any such meeting or telephone
conference.

(b) The Selling Entities shall not pursue any Avoidance Action against any
current or former supplier, vendor or landlord of the Selling Entities or the
Business who is a party to a Contract or a Real Property Lease, and each of
the Selling Entities hereby releases, effective as of the Closing, any rights
it may have with respect to any such Avoidance Action.



 

70 (c) The Buyer shall honor and observe any and all policies of the Selling
Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary in effect on the Petition Date
prohibiting the transfer of personally identifiable information about
individuals consistent with the requirements of Section 363(b)(1)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

(d) To the extent that any current or prior insurance policy of any of the
Selling Entities relate to the Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities (excluding and Excluded Insurance Policies) and such insurance
policy is not transferable to Buyer or a Buyer Designee at the Closing in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Selling Entities shall hold such
insurance policy for the benefit of Buyer or such Buyer Designee, shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer (at the Buyers cost and expense) in pursuing
any claims thereunder, and shall pay over to Buyer promptly any insurance
proceeds paid or recovered thereunder with respect to the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities. In the event Buyer determines to purchase replacement
coverage with respect to any such insurance policy, the Selling Entities shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to terminate such insurance policy and shall,
at the option of Buyer, promptly pay over to Buyer any refunded or returned
insurance premiums received by any Selling Entities in connection therewith or
cause such premiums to be applied by the applicable carrier to the replacement
coverage arranged by Buyer.

(e) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into, or cause a Buyer Designee to
enter into, employment agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer with each Current Employee identified on _Schedule 8.2(f)_.

Section 7.19 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Except with respect to the
actions required by this Agreement, the Seller shall give prompt notice to
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Buyer shall give prompt notice to the
Seller, on the other hand, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any of its
respective representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) any
material failure of any of the Selling Entities or the Buyer, respectively, to
comply with or satisfy any of its covenants, conditions or agreements to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement in any material respect;
_provided_ , _however_ , (x) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.19_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
the party receiving such notice under this Agreement, (y) any failure to
comply with this _Section 7.19_ shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the conditions to closing set forth in _Article VIII_
have been or would be satisfied, and (z) no Party shall have any Liability
hereunder for failure to deliver any notice required to be delivered pursuant
to this _Section 7.19_.

Section 7.20 _Purchased Assets "AS IS;" Certain Acknowledgements_.

(a) The Buyer agrees, warrants and represents that, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document (a) the Buyer
is purchasing the Purchased Assets on an "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" basis

has been agreed upon by the Selling Entities and the Buyer after good-faith
arms-length negotiation in light of the Buyers agreement to purchase the
Purchased Assets "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS." The Buyer agrees, warrants and
represents that, except as set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer has relied,
and shall rely, solely upon its own investigation of all such matters, and
that the Buyer assumes all risks with respect thereto. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
ARTICLE V OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLING ENTITIES MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTY, NO
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NO WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
AND NO IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO ANY REAL OR
PERSONAL PROPERTY OR ANY FIXTURES OR THE PURCHASED ASSETS.

(b) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to
discuss the Business with the management of Seller and has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from management of Seller,
and (b) has had reasonable access to the books and records of the Selling
Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary, (c) has conducted its own
independent investigation of the Selling Entities and the Acquired
Subsidiary, the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and
the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with the investigation by
the Buyer, the Buyer has received or may receive from the Selling Entities
certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and
certain business plan information. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees neither
the Selling Entities nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
Liability or indemnification obligation to the Buyer or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to, or use by, the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or any Buyers Representative of any information provided to the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Buyers Representative by the Selling
Entities or any Representative of the Seller, including any information,
documents, projections, forward-looking statements, forecasts or business
plans or any other material made available in any "data room," any
confidential information memoranda or any management presentations in
expectation of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article V_ of
this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that none of the Selling Entities nor any
other Person on behalf of any Selling Entity makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Selling Entities, the Acquired
Subsidiary, the Japanese JV, the Purchased Assets or the Business, or with
respect to any information provided to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
any Representative of the Buyer, and the Selling Entities hereby disclaim any
other representations or warranties made by the Selling Entities or any other
Person with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Purchased Assets, the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Buyer has not relied on any representation, warranty or other statement by any
Person on behalf of the Selling Entities, other than the representations and
warranties of the Selling Entities expressly contained in _Article V_. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article V_ are made solely by the Selling Entities, and no Affiliate of the
Selling Entities, Sellers Representative or other Person shall have any
responsibility or Liability related thereto.



 

72 Section 7.21 _Collection of Accounts Receivable_.

(a) As of the Closing Date, each Selling Entity hereby (i) authorizes the
Buyer or any Buyer Designee to open any and all mail addressed to any Selling
Entity relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets and delivered to the
offices of the Business or otherwise to Buyer or any Buyer Designee if
received on or after the Closing Date and (ii) appoints the Buyer, any Buyer
Designee or its attorney-in-fact to endorse, cash and deposit any monies,
checks or negotiable instruments received by the Buyer of any Buyer Designee
after the Closing Date with respect to Accounts Receivable that are Purchased
Assets or accounts receivable relating to work performed by the Buyer after
the Closing, as the case may be, made payable or endorsed to any Selling
Entity or Selling Entitys order, for the Buyers or any Buyer Designees own
account.

(b) As of the Closing Date, each Selling Entity agrees that any monies, checks
or negotiable instruments received by any Selling Entity after the
Closing Date with respect to Accounts Receivable that are Purchased Assets or
accounts receivable relating to work performed by the Buyer after the Closing,
as the case may be, shall be held in trust by such Selling Entity for the
Buyers or any Buyer Designees benefits and accounts, and promptly upon
receipt by a Selling Entity of any such payment, such Selling Entity shall pay
over to the Buyer or its designee the amount of such payments without any
right of set off or reimbursement. In addition, the Buyer agrees that, after
the Closing, it will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver to the
Seller, from time to time as and when received by the Buyer or its Affiliates,
any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements, or other property that the
Buyer or its Affiliates may receive on or after the Closing which properly
belongs to the Selling Entities hereunder, including any Excluded Assets.

(c) As of the Closing Date, the Buyer or any Buyer Designee shall have the
sole authority to bill and collect Accounts Receivable that are Purchased
Assets and accounts receivable relating to work performed by the Buyer after
the Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained hereto, any Buyer
Designees who acquire any Accounts Receivable that are Purchased Assets
hereunder shall be express third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.21_.

Section 7.22 _Cooperation with Financing and Title Insurance_. In order to
assist the Buyer with obtaining debt financing for the Business following the
Closing and one or more policies and/or a commitment to issue one or
more policies of real estate title insurance with respect to the Owned Real
Property, the Selling Entities shall, and shall cause the Acquired Subsidiary
to, provide such assistance and cooperation as the Buyer may reasonably
request, including cooperation in the preparation of documentation for a
credit facility of the Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries that would be effective
after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Credit Facility_ "), the preparation of
any information memorandum or similar document, making senior management of
Seller reasonably available for customary presentations and cooperation with
prospective lenders in performing their due diligence, entering into customary
agreements and entering into pledge and security documents, other definitive
financing documents or other requested certificates or documents, it being
understood and agreed, however, that neither the  



 

73  availability of third party financing, whether under the Post-Closing Credit
Facility or otherwise, or the issuance of title insurance is a
condition precedent to the Buyers obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 7.22_ to the contrary, (a) no Selling Entity or
Acquired Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment fee or similar fee
or incur any liability with respect to obtaining the financing or the real
estate title insurance described in this _Section 7.22_ prior to the Closing,
(b) no officer, director or employee of any Selling Entity or the Acquired
Subsidiary shall be required to execute any documents that will be effective
prior to the Closing, and (c) no Selling Entity nor the Acquired Subsidiary
shall be required to issue any information memoranda or to indemnify any
Person in connection with any such financing. The Buyer shall reimburse the
Selling Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary for all reasonable and documented
out of pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
assistance and cooperation. Without limiting the foregoing, no Selling Entity
nor the Acquired Subsidiary shall be liable for any obligation incurred any
connection with any such financing or title insurance and the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary
therefrom. Prior to the Closing, the proposed lenders in connection with the
marketing of the Post-Closing Credit Facility shall be permitted to use the
Sellers name and logo on the cover of any information memorandum used
in connection with the Buyers obtaining the Post-Closing Credit Facility;
_provided_ that the Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries shall be identified as the
borrowers under any such Post-Closing Credit Facility in the information
memorandum and the Buyer shall indemnify the Selling Entities from any
liability arising in connection therewith.

only to delivery of notice and the opportunity to cure, if curable, required
by _Section 9.1(d)_), and (ii) that the Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(g)_ if, at the time of

(h) the Buyer, if at any time after the DIP Facility Effective Date

Section 9.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event
of termination of this Agreement by either Seller or Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the
terminating Party to the other Party and this Agreement shall terminate and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further
action by any of the Parties; _provided, however_ , that (a) no Party shall be
relieved of or released from any Liability arising from any intentional breach
by such Party of any provision of this Agreement  



 

78  and (b) this _Section 9.2_, _Section 7.2(d)_, _Section 7.3_ and _Section
7.11_, _Article X_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.3  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the
Selling Entities, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, may, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the Buyer (in the case of an
agreed extension by the Selling Entities) or the Selling Entities (in the case
of an agreed extension by the Buyer), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Buyer (in the case of a wavier by the
Selling Entities) or the Selling Entities (in the case of a waiver by the
Buyer) contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements of the Buyer (in the case of a
wavier by the Selling Entities) or the Selling Entities (in the case of a
waiver by the Buyer) contained herein, or (d) waive any condition to its

the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of the Selling Entities or the Buyer, as applicable. The failure or
delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of any rights hereunder.

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any such assignment shall be null and void; _provided_ that the
rights of the Buyer under this Agreement may be assigned by the Buyer,
without the prior written consent of any Selling Entity, to one or more Buyer
Designees, so long as the Buyer shall continue to remain obligated in full
hereunder. No assignment by any Party (including an assignment by Buyer to
any Buyer Designee) shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, including,
in the case of Domestic Selling Entities, the trustee in the Bankruptcy Case
and, in the case of the Canadian Selling Entities, any trustee or
receiver appointed in respect of the Canadian Selling Entities.

Section 10.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon a determination that any term
or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.6 _Governing Law_. Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code apply, this Agreement, and all claims and causes of
action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles that would
result in the application of any Laws other than the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

Section 10.7 _Acknowledgement and Release_.

(a) The Buyer acknowledges that the Selling Entities are the sole Persons
bound by, or liable with respect to, the obligations and Liabilities of the
Selling Entities under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
and that no Affiliate of any Selling Entity or any of their respective
subsidiaries or any current or former officer, director, stockholder, agent,
attorney, employee, representative, advisor or consultant of any Selling
Entity or any such other Person shall be bound by, or liable with respect to,
any aspect of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.



 

81 (b) The Seller acknowledges that except as provided pursuant to the Limited
Guarantee, the Buyer and any Buyer Designee are the sole Persons bound by, or
liable with respect to, the obligations and Liabilities of the Buyer and any
such Buyer Designee under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
and that no Affiliate of the Buyer or any current or former officer,
director, stockholder, agent, attorney, employee, representative, advisor or
consultant of the Buyer shall be bound by, or liable with respect to, any
aspect of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 

Section 10.8 _SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) Any action, claim, suit or Legal Proceeding arising out of, based upon or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than
the CCAA Case and the proceedings related thereto shall be brought solely in
the Bankruptcy Court (or any court exercising appellate jurisdiction over the
Bankruptcy Court). Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court (or any court exercising appellate
jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Court) in respect of any action, claim, suit
or Legal Proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement
or any of the rights and obligations arising hereunder, and agrees that it
will not bring any action arising out of, based upon or related thereto in any
other court; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Bankruptcy Case and the
CCAA Case are dismissed, any action, claim, suit or Legal Proceeding arising
out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined solely in the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each
Party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or Legal
Proceeding, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with _Section 10.3_, (b) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or Legal
Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or Legal Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement
or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or entered into in
connection herewith, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or the service of
process in any action, claim, suit or Legal Proceeding arising out of, based
upon or relating to this Agreement or any of the rights and obligations
arising hereunder or thereunder, shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 10.3_.

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT OR LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES
HERETO ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF.



 

82 Section 10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and
in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement,
and which shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by facsimile or otherwise) to the
other Parties.

Section 10.10 _Incorporation of Schedules and Exhibits_. All Schedules and all
Exhibits attached hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein
by reference and made a part of this Agreement for all purposes as if fully
set forth herein.

Section 10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
all Exhibits) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Parties with
respect thereto.

Section 10.12 _Remedies_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that monetary
damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and any such injunction shall be in addition to
any other remedy to which any Party is entitled, at law or in equity.

Section 10.13 _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. It is expressly understood and
agreed that (a) the disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other Section or subsection of this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, (b) the disclosure of any matter or item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that such matter
or item is required to be disclosed therein, and (c) the mere inclusion of an
item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 10.14 _Mutual Drafting; Headings; Information Made Available_. The
Parties participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement will
accordingly be construed as drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The
descriptive headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. To the extent this Agreement
refers to information or documents to be made available (or delivered or
provided) to Buyer or its Representatives, the Selling Entities shall be
deemed to have satisfied such obligation if the Seller or any of its
Representatives has made such information or document available (or delivered
or provided such information or document) to Buyer or any of its
Representatives, whether in an electronic data room, via electronic mail, in
hard copy format or otherwise.



 

83 Section 10.15 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

Except as expressly provided in _Section 7.21_ and _Section 10.7_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period,
under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.16 _Bulk Sales Law_.

Subject to the provisions of the Canadian Sale Approval and Vesting Order,
which shall waive compliance with Canadian bulk sales legislation, the Buyer
hereby waives compliance by the Selling Entities with the requirements and
provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise
be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets
to the Buyer. The Parties intend that pursuant to Section 363(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of the Purchased Assets and the Equity Interests
shall be free and clear of any security interests in the Purchased
Assets, including any liens or claims arising out of the bulk transfer laws,
and the parties shall take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to so
provide in the Sale Order.
