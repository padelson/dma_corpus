Consideration (such fund, the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Newco or the Surviving
Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an
agency of the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof which are backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody&#146;s Investors Services Inc. or Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Corporation, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker&#146;s acceptances of, repurchase or reverse
repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of
which has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500&nbsp;million (based on the
most recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available at the SEC or
otherwise). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying
Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Article&nbsp;II, Newco shall, promptly
replace or restore (or cause to be replaced or restored) the cash
in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay any outstanding Share Consideration.

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Newco,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required by the instructions, the
holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock evidenced by such Certificate, by (y)&nbsp;the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding
taxes payable in respect thereof), without any interest thereon, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates upon

Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if
the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or the ledger of the Company, the
Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company

transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Newco (or any agent designated by
Newco) any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of
Newco (or any agent designated by Newco) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.
