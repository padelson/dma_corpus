 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.  

  

 (a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Newco shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Share Consideration (such fund, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Newco or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million (based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Article II, Newco shall, promptly replace or restore (or cause to be replaced or restored) the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay any outstanding Share Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock who is entitled to receive the Per Share Price pursuant to  _Section 2.7(a)(i)_: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Newco, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required by the instructions, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificate, by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), without any interest thereon, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in 

   ##### 

  

   

accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this _Section
2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share
Price (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof),
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this  _Article II_. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to
each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock who is entitled to receive the
Per Share Price pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(i)_ represented by book-entry on
the records of the Company or the Companys transfer agent on behalf of the
Company: (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the book-entry shares in exchange for
the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
Article II. Upon return of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal (in accordance with the instructions thereto), and such other
documents that may be required by the instructions, the holders of such book-
entry shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange thereof a check in
an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the Per Share Price, less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or the ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Newco (or any agent designated by Newco) any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Newco (or any agent designated by Newco) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. 

   

 (e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company-Based Stock Awards and Company Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under all applicable Tax Laws and shall pay such amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to and received by the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to the Surviving Corporation_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (whether held in certificated form or uncertificated and registered on the books of the Company) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder thereof (other than Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 2.8_. The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, shares of Common Stock of the Company are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

  

 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Newco, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

Limited Guarantees that would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (E) the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith (after consultation with independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, it being understood and agreed that the "independence"
of the Company Boards independence financial advisor will be determined by
the Company Board) any changes to this Agreement, the Financing
Commitment Letters and the Limited Guarantees proposed in writing by Newco
and determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect, and (F) in the
event of any material change to the financial or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Newco, an additional notice and copies of the relevant proposed transaction

In the event that any of the Company or its Subsidiaries does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Newco in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or waive such a privilege.

 (b) Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or terms no less favorable to Newco and no more conditional than the terms described therein as determined in the reasonable judgment of Newco), including by (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letters until execution and delivery of the definitive documentation contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letters (such documentation, as contemplated by the current versions of the Debt Commitment Letters, the "Senior Secured Credit Agreement" and the "Bridge Agreement" and the date such facilities are executed and delivered, the "Credit Agreement Effective Date" and the "Bridge Agreement Effective Date", as applicable), (ii) negotiating and entering into the Senior Credit Agreement and Bridge Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment Letters or on other terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Newco at or prior to the earlier of the expiration of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Effective Time; (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Newco and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Senior Credit Agreement and Bridge Agreement that are within their control and (iv) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters, the Senior Credit Agreement and the Bridge Agreement; provided, that, one or more Debt Commitment Letters, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and/or the Bridge Agreement may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded to add one or more lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, to increase the amount of indebtedness, to replace or modify one or more facilities with one or more new facilities or otherwise amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letters, Senior Secured Credit Agreement and/or the Bridge Agreement or otherwise (the " _New Debt Financing Commitments_ "), provided that the New Debt Financing Commitments shall not: (A) expand or adversely amend the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, in any material respect; (B) reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing; or (C) reduce the aggregate amount of available Debt Financing (unless, in the case of this clause (C), replaced with an amount of new equity financing), if from new equity financing sources, only to the extent compliant with _Section 6.4(c)_. Upon and from and after each such event, the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and Senior Secured Credit Agreement and Bridge Facility that are not so superseded at the time in question (including any such New Debt Financing Commitments) and, for purposes of this _Section 6.4_, references to " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " and " _Secured Credit Agreement_ " and " _Bridge Agreement_ " shall include such documents amended, supplemented, modified or replaced in compliance with the terms of foregoing sentence and references to " _Financing_ " shall include the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters and the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and Bridge Agreement as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 6.4(b)_ and references to " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " shall include such documents as permitted to be 

   ##### 

  

    

amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 6.4(b)_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this  _Section 6.4(b)_ permitting amendment or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letters and the Senior Secured Credit
Agreement or Bridge Agreement, as applicable, in the event the
Credit Agreement Effective Date or Bridge Agreement Effective Date occurs
prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect the Senior Secured Credit Agreement from the Credit
Agreement Effective Date through the Effective Time and the Bridge Agreement
from the Bridge Agreement Effective Date through the Effective Time. In the
event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Senior Secured
Credit Agreement or Bridge Agreement for any reason, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event Newco shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources (" _Alternative Financing_ ") on terms that are not less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Newco (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Newco) than the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Newco shall
keep the Company reasonably apprised as to the status of, and any material
developments relating to, the Debt Financing. To the extent any solvency
opinion is delivered to any of the Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Secured Credit Agreement or the Bridge Agreement, or to
other lenders pursuant to an Alternative Financing, then a copy of such
solvency opinion shall have been delivered to the Company and the Company
Board, with such solvency letter either being expressly addressed to the
Company and the Company Board or being in such form and manner as may be
required in order that the members of the Company Board shall be entitled to
rely upon such solvency letter as if such solvency letter were expressly
addressed to the members of the Company Board. 

  

 (c) Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Newco in such Equity Commitment Letter that are within its control, if any. Newco shall keep the Company reasonably apprised as to the status of, and any material developments relating to, the Equity Financing. In furtherance of the provisions of _Section 6.4(c)_, Newco and Merger Sub may enter into arrangements and agreements relating to the equity financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to add other equity financing sources, provided that: (A) any new sources of equity financing are limited partners of the Guarantors or their Affiliates or are not stockholders of the Company; (B) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (C) the arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Newco); (D) the arrangements and agreements would not diminish or release the obligations of the Guarantors to Newco or Merger Sub under the Equity Commitment Letters, adversely affect the rights of Newco or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letters, or otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of the rights of Newco or Merger Sub under the Equity Commitment Letters. Prior to the Effective Time, none of Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall enter into or make any binding Contracts or arrangements with any Person who is a stockholder of the Company concerning (i) contributions to be made to Newco or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including "rollover" contributions of Company Capital Stock to Newco or Merger Sub), (ii) the equity financing for

by such Persons to Newco or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including "rollover" contributions of Company
capital stock).

 6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company, Newco and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary so that no state anti-takeover or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if any, anti-takeover statute is or becomes applicable, to use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

None of the Company, on the one hand, or Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby shall issue any public release or make any public announcement or disclosure concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release, announcement or disclosure may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 6.7_ shall not apply to any release, announcement or disclosure made or proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_. 

  

 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Newco shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification Contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and 

    ##### 

  

    

Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement
of expenses, covering acts and omissions of directors and officers (and any
other employees or agents who otherwise would be entitled to similar benefits
thereunder pursuant to the terms thereof in effect on the date hereof), in
each case in their respective capacities as such, occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.8(a)_, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case regardless of whether such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry is made, occurs or arises prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (A) the Surviving Corporation and Newco shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, Newco will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (B) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Newco and the Surviving Corporation, whether or not Newco shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (C) the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not Newco shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (D) neither Newco or the Surviving Corporation on the one hand nor any Indemnified Person on the other hand shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.8(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and Newco shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties for any Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single action) except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have actual material conflict of interest in such action. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO 

    ##### 

  

    

Insurance. In the event that the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time, Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Newco
and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
6.8(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect. In the event that the Company does not so purchase a "tail"
policy prior to the Effective Time, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms with respect to
the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance;
_provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
6.8(c)_, Newco and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid
by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred
percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the
Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 6.8(c)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter), provided that that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Newco and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. 

   

 (d) If Newco or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Newco and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.8_. 

   

 (e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 6.8_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). 

   

 (f) The obligations and liability of Newco, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.8_ shall be joint and several. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.8_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

   

 6.9 _Confidentiality_. Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Newco and the Company have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
