notwithstanding this Section 2.06, all of the Company Interests  are  being
acquired by Buyer hereunder and the delivery by the Sellers of the Company

at or after the Closing.

 

 

(b) In  addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, Buyer and the
Company  undertake and agree to (i) file as soon as practicable, and in any
event not  later than the fifth Business Day after the date hereof (provided
that each  of  the Company and Buyer have provided the other with sufficient
information  concerning its NAICS codes required to make such filing) a
Notification and  Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States
Federal Trade Commission  and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (and  shall  file as soon as practicable any form or
report required by any other  Governmental Authority relating to antitrust,
competition, or trade regulation  matters), and (ii) use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or  cause  to be taken all commercially
reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable  consistent with this
Section 5.06 to cause the expiration or termination of  the  waiting period
under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and to receive any  other 
clearance or approval required by any other Governmental Authority or
applicable  law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Buyer nor  the Company shall be
obligated to satisfy any objection of, or accept or proffer  any willingness
to accept, any condition requested, sought or imposed by any  Governmental
Authority that would require the divestiture of or an agreement  to  hold
separate pending such divestiture or pending the receipt of any regulatory 
approvals, any assets or businesses of Buyer, the Company or any of their 
respective affiliates. Buyer and each of the Sellers shall (i) respond as 
promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any 
Governmental Authority for additional information or documentation, and (ii) 
not  extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement
with  any  Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, except with the prior consent of the other
party hereto (which shall  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). After
the date hereof and prior to  the  Closing, each of Buyer and the Sellers
shall (i) promptly notify the other  of  any written communication to that
party or its affiliates from any Governmental  Authority and, subject to
applicable law, permit the other party to review  in  advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing (and consider  in good faith
the views of the other party in connection therewith); (ii) not  agree to
participate, or to permit its affiliates to participate, in any  substantive
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect  of  any
filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Sale 
unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by 
such Governmental Authority, gives the other the opportunity to attend and 
participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other with copies of all 
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the 
substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective 
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members 
of  their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement
and  the Sale. Buyer, the Company and any Seller may, as each deems advisable
and  necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided  to  the other under this Section as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the  information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel  of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees,  officers, or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained  in  advance from the source of the materials
(Buyer, the Company or any Seller,  as  the case may be) or its legal
counsel, _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  materials concerning the
valuation of the Company may be redacted.

declare and, at or prior to Closing, pay  to  the holders of Company

Company as of the Closing Date _less_   any  amounts due and payable to
Buyer pursuant to the Initial Reconciliation under  Section 2.04 of this
Agreement.

further acts and to execute and deliver  any  documents which may be

**TERMINATION**

 

 

7.01. _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated and the Sale
contemplated hereby may be abandoned  at  any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a) by  mutual  written consent of Buyer and the Sellers;

 

 

(b) by  either  Buyer or the Sellers:

 

 

(i) if  the  Sale has not been consummated on or before the date that is
three (3) months  from the date hereof (such date, the " _Termination  Date_
");  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall  not be available to any
party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement  has been a material
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Sale to be  consummated by the
Termination Date; or

 

 

(ii) if  any  court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other
United States  Governmental Authority shall have issued a final order, decree

(c) by  Buyer,  if there has been a material breach by the Company or any
Seller or Sellers  of  any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement  which (i) would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.02(a)  or (b) and (ii) cannot be cured prior

representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
which (i) would  result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section

_provided_   that  neither the Sellers nor the Company is then in breach of

failure to consummate the Closing  on the date required by Section 2.02 shall
entitle the Sellers to terminate  this  Agreement pursuant to this Section

-24-

**ARTICLE  VIII**

 

 

**INDEMNIFICATION**

 

 

8.01. _Survival  Periods_.

 

 

(a) All  representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in
this Agreement  shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year
following the date of  the  Closing; except for (i) the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections  3.01, 3.02(a), 3.02(b), 3.04(a), 3.12 and
3.13, which shall survive until the  third anniversary of the Closing (the "
_Special  Survival Period_ "),  and  (ii) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.11(b) to the  extent any they relate to or
arise out of a Monetary Default, which shall  survive until the eighteen (18)
month anniversary of the Closing.

 

 

(b) In  the  event that an Indemnified Party (as defined below) provides
written notice  in  accordance with Section 8.03 to the Indemnifying Party
(as defined below) within  the applicable period of time set forth in the
first sentence of this Section  8.01(a), and such claim shall not have been
finally resolved before the  expiration of the applicable period referred to
in the first sentence of this  Section 8.01(a), any representation or
warranty that is the basis for such  claim  shall continue to survive and
shall remain a basis for indemnity only as to  such  specific claim (but as
to no other claim) until such claim is finally resolved.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, there shall be no period of time within which  notice of or a
claim for indemnity against any Seller must be provided by Buyer  with
respect to those items set forth in Sections 8.02(a)(i)(D).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-25-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties
contained  in this Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance
after the Closing,  and shall not extend the applicability of any covenant or
agreement of the  parties contained in this Agreement which by its terms
solely relates to the  period between the date hereof and the Closing.

 

 

8.02. _Indemnification_.  Subject  to the other provisions of this Article
VIII, from and after the  Closing:

 

 

(a) Subject  to Section 8.02(b) below, each Seller, severally but not
jointly, in the  proportion of its Ownership Percentages, shall indemnify,
defend and hold  harmless Buyer and its affiliates and their respective
officers, directors,  members, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the
" _Buyer  Group_ ")  from  and against (i) any and all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's  fees), suits, proceedings, judgments,
settlements, fines, losses, claims,  liabilities, interest, awards,
penalties, demands, assessments and damages,  (excluding punitive, special,
exemplary, lost profits, consequential, incidental  or indirect damages
regardless of legal theory other than to the extent such  amounts are
required to be paid to a third party) (collectively, " _Damages_ ")  to the 
extent relating to or arising out of (A) any breach of any representation or 
warranty made by such Seller or the Company in this Agreement (other than
any  representation or warranty contained in Section 3.09 and disregarding
any  materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in
any  representation or warranty other than in Section 3.06(b)), (B) breach of
or  failure to perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking, made by or on
behalf  of each Seller under this Agreement, (C) any Sellers Transaction
Expenses not  paid by the Company or Sellers prior to Closing, and (D) any
Retained  Liabilities _  provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  notwithstanding
the foregoing, the indemnification provided for above with  respect to any
breach of the representations and warranties made by a Seller  with respect
to itself set forth in Sections 3.01(a), 3.02(b), 3.04, 3.13 and  3.14, or
with respect to any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5.07 
hereof, shall be the responsibility only of the Sellers in breach thereof, 
or  (ii) any Excluded Taxes. " _Excluded  Taxes_ " shall  mean any Taxes
of the Company (i) for all taxable periods ending on or before  the Closing
Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any  taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date  (" _Pre-
Closing  Tax Period_ "),  and  (ii) any Taxes of any person (other than the
Company) for which the Company  is  liable, as of the Closing Date, as a
transferee or successor, by contract or  pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or  transaction occurring before
the Closing. In the case of any taxable period  that  includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle  Period_ "),  the  amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company  for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing  of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and the amount  of 
any other Taxes of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal 
to  the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction,  the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle  Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number  of  days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-26-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 8.02(a) above to the contrary,
to the extent (i)  any  amounts remain in the Indemnification Escrow, or
(ii) Buyer has elected to  exercise its right to set off any Damages against
any unpaid Contingent  Consideration, Buyer Group can recover any Damages or
Excluded Taxes incurred  by  the Buyer Group under Section 8.02(a) above
from such remaining amounts in  the  Indemnification Escrow or by allowing
Buyer to set off such Damages against  the  unpaid Contingent Consideration
without regard to the individual or several  liability of the Sellers, as
applicable.

 

 

(c) Buyer  shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their officers,
directors,  members, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "
_Seller  Group_ ")  from  Damages to the extent caused by (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty  made by Buyer in this Agreement (disregarding
for this purpose any materiality  qualification contained therein), or (ii)
breach of or the failure to perform  any covenant, agreement or undertaking,
made by or on behalf of Buyer under  this  Agreement, required to be taken
prior to the Closing.

 

 

(d) For  purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Indemnified  Party_
" shall  mean the Buyer Group or Seller Group, as applicable, that is
entitled to  indemnification under Section 8.02 which shall incur or suffer
any Damages  or  Excluded Taxes in respect of which indemnification may be
sought pursuant to  the  terms of this Article VIII. For purposes of this
Agreement, Damages shall be  calculated after giving effect to any amounts
recovered from third parties,  including amounts recovered under insurance
policies with respect to such  Damages (net of any costs of such recovery,
out-of pocket prosecution costs  and  similar costs). Any Indemnified Party
having a claim under these indemnification  provisions shall make a good
faith effort to recover all losses, costs, Damages  and expenses from
insurers of such Indemnified Party under applicable insurance  policies so as
to reduce the amount of any Damages hereunder. Each Indemnified  Party shall
use its reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that  an
Indemnified Party asserts or is reasonably likely to assert under this 
Article VIII. In the event that an Indemnified Party shall fail to make such 
reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim or liability, then
notwithstanding  anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party  shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party
for that portion of  any  Damages that could reasonably be expected to have
been avoided if the  Indemnified Party had made such efforts. No Indemnified
Party will, in any  event, be entitled to any incidental, indirect,
consequential, special,  exemplary or punitive damages resulting from or
arising out of any claim under  this Section 8.02.

 

 

8.03. _Claims_.  If an  Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification
pursuant to this Article  VIII  with respect to third party claims, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly  provide written notice to the party from
whom indemnification is being sought  (the " _Indemnifying  Party_ "), 
in  writing in accordance with Section 9.01 hereof of such claim describing
such  claim in reasonable detail including the sections of this Agreement
which form  the basis for such claim; copies of all material written evidence
thereof and  the estimated amount of the Damages that have been or may be
sustained by an  Indemnified Party; _provided_   that the  failure to
provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of the  Indemnifying
Party unless it is actually materially prejudiced thereby, subject,  however,
to the time periods specified in Section 8.01 hereof. The Indemnifying  Party
may assume the defense and control of any third party claim, and if it  so 
elects the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party
for  legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection  with  the defense thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall
allow the Indemnified  Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
defense of such third  party  claim with its own counsel and at its own
expense; _provided_   that if  the Indemnified Party is advised in writing
by counsel chosen by it that there  are one or more defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which the  Indemnifying Party has not or cannot assert on
behalf of the Indemnified Party,  then the applicable Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to participate in  any  such defense with one separate
counsel for all Indemnified Parties at the  reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall,  and  shall cause each of
its affiliates and representatives to, cooperate fully  with  the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any third party claim. The Indemnifying 
Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any 
judgment arising from, any third party claim, without the consent of any 
Indemnified Party, _provided_   that the  Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay
or cause to be paid all amounts arising out  of  such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such  settlement, (ii) not encumber
any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or  agree to any restriction or
condition that would apply to or materially  adversely affect any Indemnified
Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Party's  business, (iii) obtain, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution,  a  complete release of any
Indemnified Party potentially affected by such third  party claim, and (iv)
ensure that such settlement does not include any admission  of wrongdoing or
misconduct. Anything in this section to the contrary  notwithstanding,
Sellers shall have the exclusive right to control any third  party claim,
action or proceeding relating to Excluded Taxes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
if any  such settlement, claim, action or proceeding would reasonably be
expected to  result in a material increase in the tax liability of the
Company or the Buyer  for a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date,  the  Buyer shall have the right to participate in
such settlement, claim, action  or  proceeding at its own expense, and
Sellers shall not settle such claim, action,  or proceeding without the
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be  unreasonably delayed or
withheld.

8.04. _Limitation  of Liability_.

 

 

(a) In  no  event shall any Seller be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Sections  8.02(a)(i)(A) (other than with respect to the breach of any
representations  and  warranties contained in Section 3.11(b) to the extent
any such Damages relate  to  or arise out of a Monetary Default or covered
under the Special Survival Period)  unless and until the aggregate of all
such claims result in total Damages which  are incurred or suffered by Buyer
that exceed $2,400,000 (the " _Threshold_ "),  in  which case Buyer shall be
entitled to indemnification for only such Damages  that  are in excess of
the Threshold; and _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the aggregate liability
of such Seller pursuant to Sections 8.02(a)(i)(A) (other  than with respect
to the breach of any representations and warranties contained  in Section
3.11(b) to the extent any such Damages relate to or arise out of  a 
Monetary Default or covered under the Special Survival Period) shall not be 
in  excess of an aggregate amount of (i) $19,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") 
multiplied by (ii) the Ownership Percentage of such Seller. The aggregate 
liability of any Seller with respect to (i) Damages relating to or arising 
out  of (A) a breach of any representations and warranties covered under the
Special  Survival Period, (B) a breach of any representations and warranties
contained  in  Section 3.11(b) to the extent any such Damages relate to or
arise out of a  Monetary Default, (C) breach of or failure to perform any
covenant, agreement  or  undertaking, made by or on behalf of each Seller
under this Agreement, (D)  any  Retained Liabilities, (E) any Sellers
Transaction Expenses not paid by the  Company or the Sellers prior to
Closing, or (F) acts of fraud, or (ii) any  Excluded Taxes shall not be in
excess of (i) $225,000,000 multiplied by (ii)  the  Ownership Percentage of
such Seller, less any amounts paid with respect to  the  breach of any
representations and warranties not covered by the Special Survival  Period,
if applicable (the " _Special  Cap_ ").  For  purposes of clarification,
neither the Threshold nor the Cap shall be applicable  to the Sellers'
liability for indemnification with respect to (i) Damages  relating to or
arising out of (A) a breach of any representations and warranties  covered
under the Special Survival Period, (B) a breach of any representations  and
warranties contained in Section 3.11(b) to the extent any such Damages 
relate to or arise out of a Monetary Default, (C) breach of or failure to 
perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking, made by or on behalf of each 
Seller under this Agreement, (D) any Retained Liabilities, (E) any Sellers 
Transaction Expenses not paid by the Company or the Sellers prior to
Closing,  or  (F) acts of fraud, or (ii) any Excluded Taxes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-28-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  no  event shall Buyer be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.02(c)(i)  for any claim (other than any claim relating to Excluded
Taxes) unless and  until  the aggregate of all such claims result in total
Damages which are incurred  or  suffered by the Sellers that exceed the
Threshold, in which case the Sellers  shall be entitled to indemnification
for only such Damages that are in excess  of  the Threshold; and _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  the aggregate liability of Buyer pursuant to Section
8.02(c)(i) shall not be  in  excess of the Cap except for Damages relating
to or arising out of acts of  fraud  on the part of Buyer.

 

 

8.05. _Satisfaction  of Buyer Group Damages_.  In the  event that the
Sellers are required to indemnify the Buyer Group for any Damages  under this
Article VIII, the Damages shall first be satisfied out of the 
Indemnification Escrow to the extent available, and thereafter, in  the 
sole and absolute discretion of Buyer, the  Buyer  Group shall have the
right but not the obligation to set-off any Damages against  any amount that
may become due to the Sellers as  Contingent Consideration under Section
2.03(e) of this Agreement or to seek  such  Damages directly from the
Sellers in accordance with the provisions of this  Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer, in  its  sole and absolute discretion, shall have the
right but not the obligation to  pursue the satisfaction of any Damages
related to the Assumed Liabilities  against any Seller individually, to the
extent that such Seller is liable for  such Damages under Section 8.02
hereunder, prior to seeking satisfaction of  such  Damages out of the
Indemnification Escrow.

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in  a  written instrument signed on

to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or  otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof is intended to confer upon 
any  person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies  hereunder.

 

 

9.08. _Severability_.  If any  term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable,  all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect  so  long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby  is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.

 

 

9.09. _Action  by the Sellers_.  Each  Seller hereby appoints Ben Kraner
(the " _Sellers '  Representative_")  as  his, her or its attorney-in-fact,

by Buyer after the Closing, to take all actions and make all decisions 
contemplated by this Agreement, and to take any other action permitted or 
required by this Agreement to be taken on behalf of the Sellers, and to 
administer all other matters related hereto. The Sellers' Representative may
be  removed or replaced by Sellers holding a majority of the outstanding
shares  of  the Company Interests, _provided_   that  Buyer consents to

unreasonably withheld.

 

 

9.10. _Specific  Performance_.  The  parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any of  the  provisions of this Agreement
were not to be performed in accordance with the  terms hereof, and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance  of  the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity. In  the  event that any
party institutes legal proceedings to enforce any obligations  hereunder,
then all attorneys\' fees and costs actually and reasonably incurred  in
connection with the prosecution and/or defense of such legal proceeding 
shall  be awarded and paid to the prevailing party by the party who does not
so  prevail. These fees and costs shall be in addition to any fees and
costs  recoverable under applicable law or statute. The "prevailing party"
is  that party whose position is substantially upheld in the ultimate
adjudication  of the dispute, including any appeals.
