effect the Merger (as defined below) and has engaged in no other business
activities and has conducted its business activities and operations only as
contemplated hereby;   The Boards of Directors of Adaptive, Western and
Merger Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation
and its respective stockholders that Merger Sub merge into Adaptive, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;   Approval of the
Merger and this Agreement requires a vote for (x) adoption of this Agreement
by the holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $.10 per share, of
Adaptive (the "Adaptive Common Stock") at a meeting at which a quorum 
--------------------- is present, in the manner specified in the certificate
of incorporation of Adaptive and otherwise in accordance with the law of the
State of Delaware (the "Adaptive Stockholder Approval"), and (y) the approval

-------------- Stock") pursuant to this Agreement, by the holders of a
majority of the shares ----- of Western Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon represented, in person or by proxy, at a meeting at which a quorum is
present, in accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the
"Western Stockholder Approval");  ----------------------------   In
furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors of each of Adaptive, Western and
Merger Sub have approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each share of
Adaptive Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (as defined below);   As a condition and inducement to

in the form of Exhibit C (the "WMC Holding Voting 
------------------ Agreement") pursuant to which WMC Holding has agreed,
among other things, to --------- vote all shares of Western Common Stock

Western have entered into agreements with respect to their employment in
connection with this Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time; and  
For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify
as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and this Agreement will 
---- constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368 of the
Code.   AGREEMENT  ---------   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby and thereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE
MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS   1.1 The Merger.  ----------   Upon the

Effective Time:  ----  (a) The Surviving Corporation. Upon the terms and
subject to the  ------------------------- conditions of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into Adaptive (the "Merger"), the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Adaptive  ------ (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") shall survive 
--------------------- the Merger. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be "Adaptive Broadband Corporation". The Surviving Corporation shall continue
to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate
corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by
the Merger.   1.2 Closing.  -------   Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VI and the termination rights set forth in
Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place on the
third Business Day after the satisfaction  ------- or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date (as defined below)) set
forth in Article VI, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated
pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of the Closing being referred
to herein as the "Closing Date"). The  ------------   2   Closing shall
be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett, 3330 Hillview Avenue,
Palo Alto, CA 94304, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.   1.3 Effective Time.  --------------   As soon as
practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law)
of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at the Closing the parties shall
file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with 
--------------------- the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such
form as is required by and executed and acknowledged in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at (i) the date
and time the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or (ii) such subsequent time as Western, Merger Sub
and Adaptive shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of
Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective
Time").  --------------  1.4 Effects of the Merger. 
---------------------   At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.   1.5
Charter and Bylaws.  ------------------   (a) Certificate of Incorporation.
At the Effective Time, and without  ---------------------------- any further
action on the part of Western or Merger Sub, the certificate of incorporation
of Adaptive, as amended and restated prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
law.   (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, and without any further action
on  ------ the part of Western or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
law.   1.6 Officers and Directors.  ----------------------   The officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be, except that Daniel Scharre and Donna Birks
shall be President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively, of Western. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.  
3    1.7 Effect on Common Stock.  ----------------------   As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any shares of Adaptive Common Stock or of any shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock (as defined below):   (a) Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each
issued and outstanding share of  -------------------------- common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common 
----------------- Stock") shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into
one share of common ----- stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Merger Sub-Owned Adaptive Common Stock.
Each share  ------------------------------------------------------ of
Adaptive Common Stock that is owned by Western or Merger Sub
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
cash, Western Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefore.   (c) Conversion of Adaptive Common
Stock. Subject to Section 2.5, each 
----------------------------------- issued and outstanding share of Adaptive
Common Stock (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.7(b)), shall
be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Western Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The "Exchange Ratio" means 1.345. The
amount of Western Common Stock into which  -------------- each such share of
Adaptive Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of a fractional share) is converted
is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration". 
--------------------   (d) Cancellation and Retirement of Adaptive Common
Stock. As a result  ---------------------------------------------------- of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at
the Effective Time, all shares of Adaptive Common Stock shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Adaptive Common Stock (such certificate
or other evidence of ownership, a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to
have any  ----------- rights with respect to such shares of Adaptive Common
Stock, except the right (subject to Section 1.7(c)) to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Western Common
Stock) to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Article II.   1.8 Treatment of Stock Options
and Other Equity-Based Awards. 
--------------------------------------------------------  Each outstanding
option to purchase Adaptive Common Stock (a "Adaptive Common 
--------------- Stock Option") granted prior to the Effective Time and which
remains outstanding ------------ immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Adaptive Common Stock
and shall be converted (each, as so converted, a "Adaptive Converted
Option"), at the Effective Time, into an option 
------------------------- to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Adaptive Common Stock Option, that number of shares
of Western Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Adaptive Common Stock subject to such Adaptive Common Stock Option by the
Adaptive Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Western Common Stock, at a price per share (rounded up to the
nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the per share exercise price
specified in such Adaptive Common Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio;
provided, however, that in the case of  -------- -------   4   any
Adaptive Common Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies
by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option
price, the number of shares subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. The terms,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Adaptive Common
Stock Options shall otherwise remain unchanged. Western shall file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, within fifteen (15) days after the
Effective Time, a Registration Statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares
of Western Common Stock issuable with respect to the Adaptive Common Stock
Options assumed by Western in accordance with this Section 1.8. In addition
to the foregoing, Adaptive shall take all actions necessary to provide that,
with respect to its Supplemental Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and its
Phantom Stock Plan thereunder, all common and phantom stock accounts shall be
converted into common and phantom stock accounts, as applicable, relating to
shares of Western Common Stock and all such stock accounts, when and to the
extent payable in stock, shall be paid in shares of Western Common Stock.  
1.9 Certain Adjustments.  -------------------   If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time (and as permitted by Sections 4.1 and
4.2), the outstanding shares of Western Common Stock or the outstanding
shares of Adaptive Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in
each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock
dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a
record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the
Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 1.7(c)) shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Adaptive Common Stock, Adaptive Common
Stock Options and Western Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   ARTICLE II  EXCHANGE
OF CERTIFICATES   2.1 Exchange Fund.  -------------   Prior to the
Effective Time, Western shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Adaptive, or a subsidiary thereof, to act as
exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for
the applicable Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to
the  -------------- Effective Time, Western shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Adaptive Common
Stock, certificates representing the shares of Western Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.7 in exchange for Certificates. Western agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, cash sufficient
to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and
certificates representing Western Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund". 
-------------    5    2.2 Exchange Procedures.  -------------------  
Promptly after the Effective Time, Western shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Adaptive may reasonably specify (such letter to be
reasonably acceptable to Adaptive prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for
the applicable Merger Consideration, together with any dividends and other
distributions with respect thereto and any cash in lieu of fractional shares.
Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore (A) one or more shares of Western Common Stock
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7 (after taking into account
all shares of Adaptive Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check
in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Western Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section
2.5. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Adaptive Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of Adaptive a certificate evidencing,
in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Western Common Stock, a
check in the proper amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Western Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3,
may be issued with respect to such Adaptive Common Stock to such a transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of Adaptive Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   2.3 Distributions with
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. 
------------------------------------------------   No dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Western Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares of Western Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.5 until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder thereof without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of
Western Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5
and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Western Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Western Common Stock.   6    2.4 No Further Ownership Rights
in Adaptive Common Stock. 
----------------------------------------------------   All shares of Western
Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Adaptive
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.3 or 2.5) shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Adaptive Common Stock.   2.5 No Fractional Shares of Western
Common Stock.  --------------------------------------------   (a) No
certificates or scrip or shares of Western Common Stock representing
fractional shares of Western Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to have any rights of a stockholder of Western or a holder of shares of
Western Common Stock.   (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Adaptive Common Stock converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Western Common Stock (determined after aggregating all fractional
shares of Western Common Stock to such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i)
such fractional part of a share of Western Common Stock multiplied by (ii)
the closing price for a share of Western Common Stock as reported on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
("NASDAQ") on the first trading day following the date on which  ------ the
Effective Time occurs. As promptly as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests,
the Exchange Agent shall so notify Western, and Western shall deposit such
amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms hereof.   2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. 
----------------------------   Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall, at Western\'s request, be delivered to Western or
otherwise on the instruction of Western, and any holders of the Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall after such
delivery look only to Western for the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Adaptive Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 2.2, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Western Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions with
respect to shares of Western Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Adaptive Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(iii)) shall, to the
extent permitted by law, become the property of Western free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   2.7 No
Liability.  ------------   7    To the fullest extent permitted by law,
none of Western, Merger Sub, Adaptive, Western Majority Shareholder or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   2.8
Investment of the Exchange Fund.  -------------------------------   The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Western on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or 
-------- loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Adaptive
stockholders pursuant to Article I and the other provisions of this Article
II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
promptly be paid to Western.   2.9 Lost Certificates. 
-----------------   If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Western, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Western may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Adaptive Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Western Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Western Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.   2.10 Withholding Rights.  ------------------   Western shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Adaptive Common Stock
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Western, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Adaptive Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Western.   2.11 Further Assurances. 
------------------   At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Western will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of Merger Sub or Adaptive, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
Merger Sub or Adaptive, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in Western any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by Western as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger.   2.12 Stock Transfer Books.  --------------------    8   
The stock transfer books of Adaptive shall be closed immediately upon the
Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Adaptive Common Stock thereafter on the records of Adaptive. On
or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent
or Western for any reason shall be exchanged for the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Adaptive Common Stock
formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Western Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3).   ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   3.1 Representations and Warranties of
Western and Merger Sub. 
--------------------------------------------------------   Except as
disclosed in the Western Filed SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(ii))
or as set forth in the Western Disclosure Schedule delivered by Western to
Adaptive prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Western 
------- Disclosure Schedule"), Western and Merger Sub jointly and severally
represent ------------------- and warrant to Adaptive as follows:   (a)
Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries. 
----------------------------------------------   (i) Western and each of its
Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.11), including Merger Sub, is a
corporation or other organization duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Western or Merger Sub. The copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Western and Merger Sub that were
previously furnished or made available to Adaptive are true, complete and
correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.   (ii) Western has no Subsidiaries that as of the date of this

all other available information relating to such Western Named Customers,
causes such Western Named Executives to believe that Part I of Schedule
3.1(q) is unreasonable. For purposes of this paragraph 3.1(q), "Western Named
Executives"  ------------------------ means Jonathan Zakin, Amir Zoufonoun
and Nancy Huber. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Western Named

or any of its Subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of their affiliation
with any member of their "Controlled Group" (defined as any organization
which is a member of a  ---------------- controlled group of organizations

any present or former employee of Adaptive or any of its Subsidiaries of any
money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits
to any present or former employee of Adaptive or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.2(n), there is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or

of  ----------------------- Section 3.2(p) of the Adaptive Disclosure
Schedule, Adaptive reasonably believes that its relationships with its
suppliers and customers are satisfactory. Except as set forth in Part II of
Section 3.2(p) of the Adaptive Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this
Agreement, Adaptive believes, based on its inquiry of the Adaptive Named
Executives (defined below), that the estimates contained in Part I of
Schedule 3.2(p) for the customers named therein (the "Adaptive Named 
-------------- Customers") are reasonable under the circumstances. Except as
set forth in Part --------- II of Section 3.2(p) of the Adaptive Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, nothing has come to the attention
of the Adaptive Named Executives, including any written or email
correspondence from customers or from other employees of Adaptive, that,
taken in the aggregate together with    28   all other available
information relating to such Adaptive Named Customers, causes such Adaptive
Named Executives to believe that Part I of Schedule 3.2(p) is unreasonable.
For purposes of this paragraph 3.2(p), "Adaptive Named 
-------------- Executives" means Fred Lawrence, Daniel Scharre, Donna Birks
and Ken Wees. As of ---------- the date of this Agreement, none of the
Adaptive Named Customers has terminated or canceled its agreement with
Adaptive.   (q) Properties. Except for properties and assets disposed of in
the  ---------- ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
since June 30, 2000, Adaptive and its Significant Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title, free and clear of all liabilities and liens, to all their
material properties and assets, whether tangible or intangible, real,
personal or mixed. All material buildings, fixtures, equipment and other
property and assets held under leases by Adaptive or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries are held under valid instruments enforceable by Adaptive or such
Significant Subsidiary in accordance with their respective terms.
Substantially all of Adaptive\'s and its Significant Subsidiaries\' equipment
in regular use has been well maintained and is in good and serviceable
condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted.   (r) Environmental Matters.
Except as would not reasonably be  --------------------- expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect:   (i)
Adaptive and its Subsidiaries hold, and are in compliance with and have been
in continuous compliance with all Environmental Permits, and are, and have
been, otherwise in compliance with all Environmental Laws;   (ii) None of
Adaptive and its Subsidiaries has received any Environmental Claim, and none
of Adaptive and its Subsidiaries is aware of any threatened Environmental
Claim;   (iii) None of Adaptive and its Subsidiaries has entered into,
has agreed to, or is subject to any judgment, decree, order or other
similar requirement of any governmental authority under any Environmental
Laws;   (iv) To the knowledge of Adaptive, Hazardous Materials have not
been generated, transported, treated, stored, disposed of, arranged to be
disposed of, released or threatened to be released at, on, from or under any
of the properties or facilities currently or formerly owned, leased or
otherwise used by Adaptive or its Subsidiaries, in violation of, or in a
manner or to a location that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
liability to Adaptive or any of its Subsidiaries under any Environmental
Laws; and   (v) None of Adaptive and its Subsidiaries has assumed,
contractually or by operation of law, any liabilities or obligations under
any Environmental Laws.   (s) Certain Divestitures. Since January 1, 1998,
Adaptive has sold  -------------------- all of the businesses and other
assets listed on Schedule 3.2(q) of the Adaptive Disclosure Schedule (the
"Divested Businesses"). Set forth on Section 3.2(q) of 
------------------- the Adaptive Disclosure Schedule is a list of all
material agreements, arrangements and understandings to which Adaptive or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or pursuant to which they may have any
obligations or liabilities (whether absolute, contingent or otherwise and
whether or not required to be set forth or reflected in a consolidated
balance sheet of Adaptive prepared in accordance with GAAP) relating to
the   29   Divested Businesses or the sale thereof other than obligations
or liabilities against which Adaptive is indemnified by the acquiror thereof
(the "Divestiture  ----------- Agreements"). Adaptive has provided to
Western true and correct copies of the ---------- Divestiture Agreements.
All of the Divestiture Agreements are in full force and effect and are
unmodified. Except for obligations and liabilities arising under the
Divestiture Agreements, neither Adaptive nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any material liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether absolute,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be set forth or
reflected in a consolidated balance sheet of Adaptive prepared in accordance
with GAAP) arising out of or relating to the Divested Businesses or their
respective businesses, assets, liabilities or obligations or the sale thereof
other than obligations or liabilities against which Adaptive is indemnified
by the acquiror thereof. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(q) of the
Adaptive Disclosure Schedule, no material claims have been asserted or
threatened against Adaptive or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the
Divestiture Agreements (including, without limitation, any claims in respect
of a breach of any term of any such agreement or for any indemnification
provided by Adaptive or any of its Subsidiaries in any Divestiture Agreement)
nor to the knowledge of Adaptive is there any basis for any such claim.  
(t) Adaptive Rights Agreement. The Adaptive Board has amended 
------------------------- (substantially in the form provided to Western) the
Adaptive Rights Agreement to the effect that none of Western, Merger Sub, WMC
Holding or any of their respective affiliates shall become an "Acquiring
Person", and that no "Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as such terms
are defined in the Adaptive Rights Agreement) will occur as a result of the
approval, execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Adaptive Stock Option
Agreement or the Voting Agreement of WMC Holding or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Adaptive Rights Agreement
shall terminate and be of no further immediately prior to the Effective Time,
without any consideration being payable with respect to the outstanding
Adaptive Rights thereunder.   (u) Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker,
investment banker,  ------------------ financial advisor or other firm or
Person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other
similar commission or fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Adaptive, except Dain Rauscher Wessels, whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Adaptive.    ARTICLE IV  COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF

extent that Adaptive shall otherwise consent in writing):   (a) Ordinary
Course.  ---------------   30    Western and its Subsidiaries shall
carry on their respective businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary
course in all material respects, in substantially the same manner as
heretofore conducted, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to preserve
intact their present lines of business, maintain their rights and franchises
and preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers and others having
business dealings with them and retain the services of their respective
officers, key employees and consultants to the end that their ongoing
businesses shall not be impaired in any material respect at the Effective
Time.   (b) Dividends; Changes of Share Capital. 
-----------------------------------   Western shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall not propose to, (i) declare or
pay any dividends on or make other distributions in respect of any of its
outstanding shares of capital stock; (ii) split, combine or reclassify any of
its capital stock or issue or authorize or propose the issuance of any other
securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for, shares of its
capital stock; or (iii) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any
shares of its capital stock.   (c) Issuance of Securities. 
----------------------   Western shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, issue, deliver or sell, or authorize or propose the
issuance, delivery or sale of any shares of its capital stock of any class or
any securities convertible into or exercisable for, or any rights, warrants,

Western Stock Options or other stock based awards granted pursuant to clause
(ii) below, (ii) the granting of up to 2,500,000 Western Stock Options or
other stock based awards of or to acquire shares of Western Common Stock
granted under Western Stock Option Plans outstanding on the date hereof in

foregoing shall not  -------- ------- prohibit (x) internal reorganizations
or consolidations involving existing Subsidiaries of Western or (y) the
creation of new Subsidiaries of Western organized to conduct or continue
activities otherwise permitted by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt
and as an example only, the parties agree that an acquisition would
"materially delay" consummation of the Merger if pro forma financial
statements would be required to be included in the relevant disclosure
document relating to such acquisition and complying with such a requirement
would delay clearance of the Form S-4 (as defined below) by the SEC. Western
shall give reasonable advance notice of any such acquisition to Adaptive,
provided that Adaptive shall have agreed in writing to keep such information
confidential.   (f) No Dispositions.  ---------------   Western shall

guarantee any such indebtedness of another Person, issue or sell any debt
securities or warrants or other rights to acquire any debt securities of
Western or any of its Subsidiaries, guarantee any debt securities of another
person, enter into any "keep well" or other agreement to maintain any
financial statement condition of another Person (other than any wholly owned
Subsidiary) or enter into any arrangement having the economic effect of any
of the foregoing (collectively, "Western Indebtedness"), except in the
ordinary course of business consistent  -------------------- with past
practice and in any event not in excess of $1,000,000.   (h) Tax-Free
Qualification.  ----------------------   Western shall use its reasonable
best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit

above) whose salary and bonus is greater than $100,000 or increase the salary

Western (except that Western may make reasonable salary increases in
connection with Western customary employee review processes and market  
32   adjustments), or make any increase in or commitment to increase any

be implemented in connection with the Western open enrollment period).  
(j) Accounting Methods; Income Tax Elections. 
----------------------------------------   Except as disclosed in the
Western SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or as required
by a Governmental Entity, Western shall not change its methods of accounting
in effect at December 31, 1999, except as required by changes in GAAP as
concurred in by Western\'s independent public accountants. Western shall not
(i) change its fiscal year, (ii) make or change any Tax Election, (iii)
change any annual Tax accounting period, (iv) change any method of Tax

Adaptive Stockholders Meeting (defined in Section 5.1(b)) (such proxy
statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Western shall prepare and file with the 
-------------------------------- SEC a registration statement on Form S-4
with respect to the issuance of Western Common Stock in the Merger (such Form
S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Form S-4"). Each of
Western and Adaptive shall use its reasonable  -------- efforts to cause
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett and Cooley Godward LLP, respectively, to deliver
to it a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act, which tax opinion shall be included as
an exhibit to the Form S-4. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4 as
Western\'s prospectus. Each of Western and Adaptive shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and
the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Western and Adaptive shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any
written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments,
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received
from the SEC. The parties shall cooperate and provide the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such
with the SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings
made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by
reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be
made without the approval of both parties, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided  -------- that with respect to
documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4
or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only
with respect to information relating to the other party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations. Western will use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
Western stockholders, and Adaptive will use reasonable best efforts to cause
the   37   Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Adaptive\'s
stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Western shall also take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection
with the Merger and each of Adaptive and Western shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party will
advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of the Western Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Western or Adaptive, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Western or Adaptive, which
information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto
and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Western and
Adaptive.   (b) Adaptive shall duly take all lawful action to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a date
determined in accordance with the mutual agreement of Adaptive and Western
(the "Adaptive  -------- Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining
the Adaptive Stockholder -------------------- Approval and shall take all
lawful action to solicit the Adaptive Stockholder Vote; and the Board of
Directors of Adaptive shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of Adaptive (the
"Adaptive Recommendation"), and shall not, unless Western makes a 
----------------------- change in the Western Recommendation, (x) withdraw,
modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner
adverse to Western such recommendation or (y) take any action or make any
statement (other than any action described in the foregoing clause (x)) in
connection with the Adaptive Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such
recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Adaptive Recommendation");
provided, however, any action or  -------------------------------------
-------- ------- statement under clause (y) will not be deemed a Change in
the Adaptive Recommendation provided (I) such action or statement is taken or
made pursuant to advice from Cooley Godward LLP, counsel to Adaptive, to the
effect that such action or statement is required by applicable law, (II) if a
Adaptive Public Proposal has been made and not rescinded, such action or
statement shall not relate to such Adaptive Public Proposal other than any
factual statement required by any regulatory authority (including the SEC)
and shall in any event include a rejection of such Adaptive Public Proposal
and (III) such action or statement also includes a reaffirmation of the
Adaptive Board of Directors approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and recommendation to the Adaptive stockholders to adopt
this Agreement; provided,  -------- further, however, that the Board of
Directors of Adaptive may make a Change in ------- ------- the Adaptive
Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.4 hereof. Notwithstanding any Change in

and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of Required
Approvals under such other laws or from such authorities as soon
as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.3 or
the other provisions of this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to

covenants of the parties contained in Section 5.3(a) and (b), if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory
Law (as defined below), or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated
or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Adaptive and Western shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other and, subject to Section
5.3(a), seek to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have

and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.3 shall
limit a party\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
or 7.1(c) so long as such party has up to then complied with its obligations
under this Section 5.3. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law"
means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,  -------------- as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that

acquisitions or other business combinations, (ii) foreign investment or (iii)
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition.   (d) Each of Adaptive and Western and its
respective Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.4 Non-Solicitation.  ----------------   (a)
Without limitation on any of such party\'s other obligations under this
Agreement (including under Article IV hereof), each of Western and
Adaptive agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the
officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant    41   retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving it or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or any
purchase or sale of 10% or more of the consolidated assets (including without
limitation stock of its Subsidiaries) of such party and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer
for, the equity securities of such party that, if consummated, would result
in any Person (or the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning
securities representing 20% or more of the total voting power of such party
(or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than
a proposal or offer made by the other party or an Affiliate thereof) being
hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"), 
-------------------- (ii) have any discussion with or provide any
confidential information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal,
or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
clause (c) below, (i) each of Western and Adaptive or its respective Board of
Directors shall be permitted to, to the extent applicable, comply with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) each of Western and Adaptive or its
respective Board of Directors shall be permitted to engage in the matters set
forth in clauses (a) (ii) to (iv) above (other than executing or entering
into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement) and to
make a Change in the Western Recommendation or a Change in the Adaptive
Recommendation, as the case may be, in connection with an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal by any third party, if and only to the
extent that: (w) its Stockholders Meeting shall not have occurred, (x) its
Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (y) its Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; and (z) the Board of Directors of the subject
party shall have received from such Person a confidentiality agreement
substantially in the form of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that if
such confidentiality agreement contains provisions  -------- that are less
restrictive than the comparable provision, or omits restrictive provisions,
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the
Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed to be amended to contain only such
less restrictive provisions or to omit such restrictive provisions, as the
case may be. "Superior  -------- Proposal" means with respect to Adaptive or
Western, as the case may be, a bona -------- fide written proposal made by a
Person other than either such party which is (I) for a merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving such party as a result of
which the other party thereto or its stockholders will own 40% or more of the
combined voting power of the entity surviving or resulting from
such transaction (or the ultimate parent entity thereof) and (II) is on terms
which the Board of Directors of such party in good faith concludes (following
receipt of the advice of its financial advisors and outside counsel),
taking   42   into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the
proposal (x) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders), from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (y) is reasonably capable of being completed.   (c) Each of Adaptive
and Western agrees that it will (i) promptly (and in any event not later than
the day following receipt of any proposal or offer) advise the other orally
and in writing of the status and terms (including the identity of the Person
making the such inquiry or proposal and the nature and amount of
consideration offered) of any such proposals or offers and the status and
terms of any such discussions or negotiations, (ii) continuously keep
the other party informed of developments relating to such inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any
such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with,
any of its representatives and (iii) other than as contemplated by this
Agreement, not sign any agreement inconsistent with the consummation of the
Merger prior to the time that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms. Each of Western and Adaptive agrees that it will, and will cause
its officers, directors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of
the date of this Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of Western and Adaptive agrees that it will
use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its directors, officers, key
employees, agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 5.4. Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall permit Western or Adaptive to
terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article VII
hereof) or affect any other obligation of Western or Adaptive under this
Agreement. Neither Western nor Adaptive shall submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.    43

performance of this Agreement, the WMC Holding Voting Agreement, the Stock
Option Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 and the solicitation of stockholder
approvals and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.   5.6 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification than are set forth in Article XII of the certificate of
incorporation and Article VII of the bylaws of Adaptive, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who at the Effective Time were
directors, officers or employees of Adaptive.   (b) Western shall cause to
be maintained in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current
policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by
Adaptive (provided that Western may substitute therefore policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially
less advantageous) with respect to matters or events occurring prior to the

shall Western be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 200
percent of Adaptive\'s current premiums to maintain or procure insurance
coverage pursuant hereto; and, provided, further that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Western shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.   (c) After the Effective Time, Western agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
Adaptive, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"),

(collectively, "Costs") incurred in  ----- connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
relating to their duties or actions in their capacity as officers
and directors and existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest    44   extent permitted under applicable law (and Western shall
also advance fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides a customary undertaking
complying with applicable law to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification).   (d)
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to Adaptive or any of its officers, directors or employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for this Section 5.6
is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.   5.7 Board of Directors and Officers.

take all actions necessary to appoint Frederick Lawrence and Daniel Scharre

best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party a letter of its
independent public accountants, dated a date within two business days before

scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the

Adaptive.   61    2. Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub will merger with
and into Adaptive, and Adaptive will acquire all of the assets and
liabilities of Merger Sub. At least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market
value of the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market
value of the gross assets held by Adaptive immediately prior to the Merger
and at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the net assets
and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the gross
assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger will be held by
Adaptive after the Merger. For the purpose of determining the percentage of
Adaptive\'s and Merger Sub\'s net and gross assets held by Adaptive
immediately following the Merger, the following assets will be treated as
property held by Adaptive or Merger Sub, as the case may be, immediately
prior to the Merger but not by Adaptive subsequent to the Merger: (i) assets
disposed of by Adaptive or Merger Sub (other than assets transferred by
Merger Sub to Adaptive in the Merger) prior to or subsequent to the
Merger and in contemplation thereof (including without limitation any asset
disposed of by Adaptive or Merger Sub, other than in the ordinary course of
business, pursuant to a plan or intent existing during the period ending at
the Effective Time and beginning with the commencement of negotiations
(whether formal or informal) with Adaptive regarding the Merger (the "Pre-
Merger Period")), (ii) assets used by Adaptive or Merger Sub to pay expenses
or liabilities incurred in connection with the Merger, (iii) assets used by
Adaptive or Merger Sub to make payments to Adaptive stockholders in lieu of
fractional shares of Western Common Stock and (iv) assets used by Adaptive or
Merger Sub to make distribution, redemption or other payments in respect of
Adaptive stock or rights to acquire such stock (including payments treated as
such for tax purposes) that are made in contemplation of the Merger or
related thereto.   3. The Merger is being undertaken for business reasons
and not for the purpose of tax avoidance.   4. The Adaptive Common Stock
will be surrendered pursuant to the Merger in an arm\'s-length exchange, and
the fair market value of Western Common Stock and cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Western Common Stock received by each Adaptive
stockholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Adaptive
Common Stock surrendered by such stockholder in the Merger. In connection
with the Merger, no holder of Adaptive Common Stock will receive in exchange
for Adaptive Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other
than Western Common Stock and cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof.  
5. As of the Effective Time, neither Western nor any corporation related
to Western will, in connection with the Merger, (i) be under any obligation,
or will have entered into any agreement or understanding, directly or
indirectly, to redeem or repurchase any of the Western Common Stock issued to
stockholders of Adaptive in the Merger or to make any extraordinary
distribution in respect of such Western Common Stock or (ii) have any plan or
intention, directly or indirectly, to reacquire any of the Western Common
Stock issued in the Merger; provided, however, that Western may adopt an open
market stock repurchase program that satisfies the requirements of Revenue
Ruling 99-58. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be made to
the former Adaptive stockholders by Western other than regular, normal
dividends or distributions made to all holders of Western Common Stock.
Additionally, prior to and in connection with the Merger, neither Western nor
any corporation related to Western will have acquired Adaptive stock,
directly or indirectly, with consideration other than stock of Western. For
purposes of this representation letter, two corporations shall be treated
as   62   related to one another if immediately prior to or immediately
after the Merger, (a) the corporations are members of the same affiliated
group (within the meaning of section 1504 of the Code, but determined without
regard to section 1504(b) of the Code) or (b) one corporation owns 50% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the other
corporation that are entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of
all classes of stock of the other corporation (applying the attribution rules
of Section 318 of the Code as modified pursuant to section 304(c)(3)(B) of
the Code). For purposes of this representation, a corporation that is a
partner in a partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any stock
owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership and as having
furnished its share of any consideration furnished by the partnership to
acquire the stock, in each case, in accordance with its interest in the
partnership.   6. Neither Western nor any corporation related to Western has
any plan or intention, following the Merger: (i) to liquidate Adaptive; (ii)
to merge Adaptive with or into another corporation (except pursuant to the
Merger); (iii) to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of the stock of
Adaptive, except for transfers (including successive transfers) of such stock
to corporations controlled by the transferor corporation at the time of such
transfer, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.368-2(k) or
(iv) to cause Adaptive to sell, distribute, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of its assets, or any of the assets it acquired from Merger Sub, except
for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers
(including successive transfers) of assets to one or more corporations
controlled, in the case of each transfer, by the transferor corporation,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.368-2(k). Western has no
plan or intention to (i) cause Adaptive, after the Effective Time, to issue
additional shares of stock that would result in Western losing control of
Adaptive or (ii) otherwise take any action that could result in Western
losing control of Adaptive following the Merger. For purposes of
this representation letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall
mean ownership of at least (i) 80% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock entitled to vote and (ii) 80% of the total number of shares
of each other class of stock of the corporation.   7. To the best knowledge
of the management of Western, there is no plan or intention on the part of
stockholders of Adaptive to sell, exchange or otherwise transfer ownership of
(including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have
the economic effect of a transfer of ownership) any share of Western Common
Stock (other than fractional shares of Western Common Stock for which holders
of Western Common Stock receive cash in the Merger) to Western, Adaptive or
any person related to Western or Adaptive, directly or indirectly (including
through partnerships or through third parties in connection with a plan to so
transfer ownership).   8. Following the Merger, Western will cause Adaptive
or another member of Adaptive\' "qualified group" to continue the "historic
business" of Adaptive or use a "significant portion" of Adaptive\'s "historic
business assets" in a business, as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation
section 1.368-1(d). For purposes of this representation, Adaptive\'
"qualified group" means, pursuant to Treasury Regulation section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), one or more chains of corporations connected through stock
ownership with Adaptive, but only if Adaptive owns directly stock
representing control in at least one other corporation, and stock
representing control in each of the corporations (except Adaptive) is owned
directly by one of the other   63   corporations. In addition, Adaptive
will be treated as owning its proportionate share of Adaptive\' business
assets used in a business of any partnership in which members of Adaptive\'
qualified group either own a significant interest or have active and
substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that
partnership business.   9. Each of Western and its stockholders has paid and
will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the
Merger, and Western has not agreed to assume, nor will it assume, directly or
indirectly, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of
any holder of Adaptive Common Stock in connection with or as part of the
Merger or any related transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any
liability for transfer taxes incurred by a holder of Adaptive Common Stock
will be paid by Adaptive, and in no event by Western, and (ii) expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 will be borne equally by Adaptive and
Western.   10. There is, and at the Effective Time will be, no
intercorporate indebtedness existing between Western and Adaptive or between
Merger Sub and Adaptive that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a
discount.   11. Neither Western nor Merger Sub, as the case may be, will (i)
elect, or have in effect an election, to be treated as a "regulated
investment company" or as a "real estate investment trust" or file any tax
return consistent with such treatment or (ii) be a corporation 50% or more of
the fair market value of whose total assets are stock or securities and 80%
or more of the fair market value of whose total assets are assets held for
investment. In making the determinations described in (ii) above, (x) the
stock and securities of any subsidiary of Western shall be disregarded and
Western shall be deemed to own its ratable share of such subsidiary\'s assets
and (y) a corporation shall be considered to be a subsidiary of Western if
Western owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of the
stock of such subsidiary that are entitled to vote, or 50% or more of the
total value of all classes of the outstanding stock of such subsidiary. In
addition, in determining the fair market value of Western\'s total assets for
the purposes of making this representation, Western shall exclude any cash
and cash items (such as receivables), government securities and, to the
extent provided in the applicable Treasury regulations, any assets acquired
(through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for the purposes of causing
Western to not be characterized as an entity described in (i) or (ii) of the
first sentence of this paragraph or causing Western to meet the
requirements of section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii) of the Code.   12. None of the
compensation to be received by any stockholder-employees of Adaptive for
services rendered after the Effective Time, and none of the compensation to
be received by any stockholder-employees or stockholder- independent
contractors of Adaptive from Western for services rendered either before or
after the Effective Time, will be separate consideration for, or allocable
to, any of such stockholder-employee\'s or stockholder-
independent contractor\'s shares of Adaptive stock; none of the shares of
Western Common Stock to be received by any stockholder-employees or
stockholder-independent contractors of Adaptive in connection with the Merger
will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment,
consulting or similar agreement or arrangement or any covenant not to compete
or release with respect to services rendered after the Effective Time; and
the compensation paid to any stockholder-employees or stockholder-independent
contractors of Adaptive for services   64   rendered will be for
services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and will be commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm\'s- length for similar
services.   13. Merger Sub is being formed solely to effect the Merger and
it will not conduct any business or other activities other than the issuance
of its stock to Western prior to the Merger. Merger Sub will not have any
liabilities that will be assumed by Adaptive, and will not transfer to
Adaptive in the Merger any assets subject to liabilities.   14. Pursuant to
the Merger, all shares of Adaptive Common Stock will be exchanged solely for
Western Common Stock or for cash in lieu of fractional shares of Western
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to stockholders of Adaptive. For
purposes of this representation, shares of Adaptive Common Stock exchanged
for cash or other property originating with Western or a party related to
Western will be treated as outstanding Adaptive Common Stock at the
Effective Time.   15. Prior to the Merger and through the Effective Time,
Western will be in control of Merger Sub.   16. As of the Effective Time
neither Western nor any corporation related to Western will own beneficially
or of record, or will have owned beneficially or of record during the five
years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of Adaptive Common Stock or
other securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof
the right to acquire Adaptive Common Stock or other securities issued by
Adaptive.   17. The Western Common Stock into which Adaptive Common Stock
will be converted in the Merger is stock entitled to vote for the directors
of Western and on all other matters put forth to the shareholders of
Western.   18. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Western
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to stockholders of Adaptive in
the Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Western of issuing and transferring fractional shares of
Western Common Stock and does not represent separately bargained-for
consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger
to stockholders of Adaptive instead of issuing fractional shares of Western
Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will
be issued in the Merger to stockholders of Adaptive in exchange for their
shares of Adaptive Common Stock.   19. With respect to each instance, if
any, in which shares of Adaptive stock have been purchased by a stockholder
of Western (a "Stockholder") during the Pre-Merger Period (a "Stock
Purchase"): (i) the Stock Purchase was not made by such Stockholder as a
representative, or for the benefit, of Western; (ii) the purchase price paid
by such Stockholder pursuant to the Stock Purchase was not and will not be
advanced, and was not and will not be reimbursed, either directly or
indirectly, by Western; (iii) at no time was such Stockholder or any other
party required or obligated to surrender to Western Adaptive stock acquired
in the Stock Purchase, and neither such Stockholder nor any other party will
be required to surrender to Western the Western Common Stock for which
such shares of Adaptive stock will be exchanged   65   in the Merger;
and (iv) the Stock Purchase was not a formal or informal condition to
consummation of the Merger.   20. Following the Merger, Western, Merger Sub
and Adaptive will comply with the record-keeping and information filing
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3.   21. The Merger will
be reported by Western and Adaptive on their respective federal income tax
returns as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.   22. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the statements
and representations set forth herein on behalf of Western and Merger Sub.  
Very truly yours,   Western Multiplex Corporation    By: 
---------------------------  Name:  Title:   66    EXHIBIT
6.2(c)(2)   Adaptive Broadband Corporation  1143 Borregas Avenue 
Sunnyvale, California 94089   _____, 2000  Simpson Thacher and Bartlett 425
Lexington Avenue New York, New York 10017  Cooley Godward LLP One Maritime
Plaza, 20th Floor San Francisco, California 94111-3580  Ladies and
Gentlemen:   We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 12, 2000 (the "Agreement") among Western Multiplex Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Western"), WA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ("Merger Sub"), and Adaptive
Broadband Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Adaptive"), which provides
for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into Adaptive on the
terms and conditions set forth, the time at which the Merger becomes
effective being hereafter referred to as the "Effective Time." It is a
condition to the consummation of the Merger that Simpson Thacher and Bartlett,
counsel to Western, and Cooley Godward LLP, counsel to Adaptive, render
opinions regarding certain United States federal income tax consequences of
the Merger. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings specified
in the Agreement.   In connection with such opinions to be rendered by each
of you, and acknowledging that each of you will rely, with Adaptive\'
consent, upon the statements and representations made in this letter in
rendering such opinions, the undersigned hereby certifies and represents to
each of you on behalf of Adaptive, after due investigation and inquiry that
the statements and representations stated herein are true, correct and
complete in all respects at the date hereof and except to the extent written
notification to the contrary is received by you before the Effective Time
will be true, correct and complete in all respects as of the Effective Time
(as if made as of the Effective Time and thereafter, where relevant):   1.
The facts, representations and covenants relating to the Merger of Merger Sub
with and into Adaptive, as reflected in the Merger Agreement and
the ancillary agreement, thereto, and the Joint Proxy Prospectus prepared
by Adaptive and Western are, insofar as such fact, pertain to Adaptive,
true, accurate and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be
carried out in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and none of the material
term and conditions therein have been or will be materially or modified by
Adaptive, or to the knowledge of the management of Adaptive, by Western.  
2. Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub will merger with and into Adaptive, and
Adaptive will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of Merger Sub.
At least ninety percent   67   (90%) of the fair market value of the net
assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the
gross assets held by Adaptive immediately prior to the Merger and at least
ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the net assets and at least
seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the gross assets held by
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger will be held by Adaptive after the
Merger. For the purpose of determining the percentage of Adaptive\'s and
Merger Sub\'s net and gross assets held by Adaptive immediately following the
Merger, the following assets will be treated as property held by Adaptive or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Merger but not by
Adaptive subsequent to the Merger: (i) assets disposed of by Adaptive
or Merger Sub (other than assets transferred by Merger Sub to Adaptive in
the Merger) prior to or subsequent to the Merger and in contemplation
thereof (including without limitation any asset disposed of by Adaptive or
Merger Sub, other than in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to a plan
or intent existing during the period ending at the Effective Time and
beginning with the commencement of negotiations (whether formal or informal)
with Adaptive regarding the Merger (the "Pre-Merger Period")), (ii) assets
used by Adaptive or Merger Sub to pay expenses or liabilities incurred in
connection with the Merger, (iii) assets used by Adaptive or Merger Sub to
make payments to Adaptive stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of
Western Common Stock and (iv) assets used by Adaptive or Merger Sub to make
distribution, redemption or other payments in respect of Adaptive stock or
rights to acquire such stock (including payments treated as such for tax
purposes) that are made in contemplation of the Merger or related
thereto.   3. The Merger is being undertaken for business reasons and not
for the purpose of tax avoidance.   4. The Adaptive Common Stock will be
surrendered pursuant to the Merger in an arm\'s-length exchange, and the fair
market value of Western Common Stock and cash in lieu of a fractional share
of Western Common Stock received by each Adaptive stockholder will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of Adaptive Common Stock
surrendered by such stockholder in the Merger. In connection with the Merger,
no holder of Adaptive Common Stock will receive in exchange for their
Adaptive Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than
Western Common Stock and cash in lieu of a fractional share thereof.   5.
Adaptive, prior to and in connection with the Merger, has neither
(i) redeemed, directly or indirectly, any of its stock, nor (ii) made
any distributions with respect to its stock, in either case, where the
consideration received by a stockholder of Adaptive could be treated as
received in the Merger, or for purposes of Section 356 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code"), would be so treated if the
stockholder of Adaptive had received stock of Western in the Merger.   6.
To the best knowledge of the management of Adaptive, there is no plan
or intention on the part of stockholders of Adaptive to sell, exchange or
otherwise transfer ownership of (including by derivative transactions such as
an equity swap which would have the economic effect of a transfer of
ownership) any share of Western Common Stock (other than fractional shares of
Western Common Stock for which holders of Western Common Stock receive cash
in the Merger) to Western, Adaptive or any corporation related to Western or
Adaptive, directly or indirectly (including through partnerships or through
third parties in connection with a plan to so transfer ownership). For
purposes of this representation letter, two   68   corporations shall be
treated as related to one another if immediately prior to or immediately
after the Merger, (a) the corporations are members of the same affiliated
group (within the meaning of section 1504 of the Code, but determined without
regard to section 1504(b) of the Code) or (b) one corporation owns 50% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the
other corporation that are entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value
of shares of all classes of stock of the other corporation (applying
the attribution rules of section 318 of the Code as modified pursuant to
section 304(c)(3)(B) of the Code). For purposes of this representation, a
corporation that is a partner in a partnership will be treated as owning or
acquiring any stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership
and as having furnished its share of any consideration furnished by the
partnership to acquire the stock, in each case, in accordance with its
interest in the partnership.   7. No assets of Adaptive have been sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of so as to prevent Adaptive from
continuing the "historic business" of Adaptive or from using a "significant
portion" of Adaptive\' "historic business assets" in a business following the
Merger, as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation section 1.368-1(d). For
purposes of this representation, Adaptive\' "qualified group" means, pursuant
to Treasury Regulation section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), one or more chains of
corporations connected through stock ownership with Adaptive, but only if
Adaptive owns directly stock representing control in at least one
other corporation, and stock representing control in each of the corporations
(except Adaptive) is owned directly by one of the other corporations. In
addition, Adaptive will be treated as owning its proportionate share of
Adaptive\' business assets used in a business of any partnership in which
members of Adaptive\' qualified group either own a significant interest or
have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to
that partnership business. For purposes of this representation letter,
"control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least (i)
80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to
vote and (ii) 80% of the total number of shares of each other class of stock
of the corporation   8. Each of Adaptive and its stockholders has paid and
will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the
Merger, and Western has not agreed to assume, nor will it assume, directly or
indirectly, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of
any holder of Adaptive Common Stock in connection with or as part of the
Merger or any related transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any
liability for transfer taxes incurred by a holder of Adaptive Common Stock
will be paid by Adaptive, and in no event by Western, and (ii) Expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 will be borne equally by Adaptive and
Western.   9. There is, and at the Effective Time will be, no
intercorporate indebtedness existing between Western and Adaptive or between
Merger Sub and Adaptive that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a
discount.   10. Adaptive will not (i) elect, or have in effect an election,
to be treated as a "regulated investment company" or as a "real estate
investment trust" or file any tax return consistent with such treatment or
(ii) be a corporation 50% or more of the fair market value of whose total
assets are stock or securities and 80% or more of the fair market value of
whose total assets are assets held for investment. In making the
determinations described in (ii) above, (x) the stock and securities of any
subsidiary of Adaptive shall be disregarded and Adaptive shall be  
69   deemed to own its ratable share of such subsidiary\'s assets and (y)
a corporation shall be considered to be a subsidiary of Adaptive if Adaptive
owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of the stock of
such subsidiary that are entitled to vote, or 50% or more of the total value
of all classes of the outstanding stock of such subsidiary. In addition, in
determining the fair market value of Adaptive\' total assets for the purposes
of making this representation, Adaptive shall exclude any cash and cash items
(such as receivables), government securities and, to the extent provided in
the applicable Treasury regulations, any assets acquired (through
incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for the purposes of causing Adaptive to
not be characterized as an entity described in (i) or (ii) of the first
sentence of this paragraph or causing Adaptive to meet the requirements of
section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii) of the Code.   11. Adaptive is not, and at the
Effective Time will not be, a debtor under the jurisdiction of a court in a
Title 11 or similar case. For purposes of the foregoing, a "Title 11 or
similar case" means a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or a
receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding in a federal or state
court.   12. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of
Adaptive will equal or exceed the sum of the Adaptive\' liabilities plus
(without duplication) the amount of liabilities, if any, to which its assets
are or will be subject.   13. None of the compensation to be received by
any stockholder-employees or stockholder-independent contractors of Adaptive
for services rendered prior to the Effective Time was, or will be, separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any of such stockholder-employee\'s or
stockholder-independent contractor\'s shares of Adaptive Common Stock; none
of the shares of Western Common Stock to be received by any stockholder-
employees or stockholder-independent contractors of Adaptive in connection
with the Merger will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any
employment, consulting or similar agreement or arrangement or any covenant
not to compete or release with respect to services rendered prior to the
Effective Time; and the compensation paid to any stockholder-employees
or stockholder-independent contractors of Adaptive for services rendered
prior to the Effective Time will be for services actually rendered (or to be
rendered) and was, or will be, commensurate with amounts paid to third
parties bargaining at arm\'s-length for similar services.   14. Adaptive is
not currently, and during the five years preceding the Effective Time will
not have been, a "United States real property holding corporation." For
purposes of the foregoing, a United States real property holding corporation
means a corporation in which the fair market value of its United States real
property interests equals or exceeds fifty percent of the fair market value
of (i) its United States real property interests, (ii) its interests in real
property located outside the United States and (iii) any other of its assets
which are used or held for use in a trade or business.   15. Pursuant to the
Merger, all shares of Adaptive Common Stock will be exchanged solely for
Western Common Stock or for cash in lieu of fractional shares of Western
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to stockholders of Adaptive. For
purposes of this representation, shares of Adaptive Common Stock exchanged
for cash or other property originating with Western or a party related to
Western will be treated as outstanding Adaptive Common Stock at the
Effective Time.   70    16. Adaptive has no plan or intention to issue
any additional shares of its stock that would cause Western to own less than
(i) 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Adaptive stock
entitled to vote and (ii) 80% of the total number of shares of each other
class of stock of Adaptive.   17. At the Effective Time, Adaptive will not
have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other
type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Adaptive
that, if exercised or converted, would affect Western\'s acquisition or
retention of control of Adaptive.   18. To the knowledge of Adaptive, as of
the Effective Time neither Western nor any corporation related to Western
will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or of
record during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of
Adaptive Common Stock, or other securities, options, warrants or instruments
giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Adaptive Common Stock or other
securities issued by Adaptive.   19. There will be no dissenters to the
Merger.   20. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Western
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued to stockholders of Adaptive in
the Merger is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Western of issuing and transferring fractional shares of
Western Common Stock and does not represent separately bargained-for
consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger
to stockholders of Adaptive instead of issuing fractional shares of Western
Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will
be issued in the Merger to stockholders of Adaptive in exchange for their
shares of Adaptive Common Stock.   21. With respect to each instance, if
any, in which shares of Adaptive stock have been purchased by a stockholder
of Western (a "Stockholder") during the Pre-Merger Period (a "Stock
Purchase"): (i) the Stock Purchase was not made by such Stockholder as a
representative, or for the benefit, of Western; (ii) the purchase price paid
by such Stockholder pursuant to the Stock Purchase was not and will not be
advanced, and was not and will not be reimbursed, either directly or
indirectly, by Western; (iii) at no time was such Stockholder or any other
party required or obligated to surrender to Western Adaptive stock acquired
in the Stock Purchase, and neither such Stockholder nor any other party will
be required to surrender to Western the Western Common Stock for which
such shares of Adaptive stock will be exchanged in the Merger; and (iv) the
Stock Purchase was not a formal or informal condition to consummation of the
Merger.   22. Following the Merger, Western, Merger Sub and Adaptive will
comply with the record-keeping and information filing requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3.   23. The Merger will be reported by
Western and Adaptive on their respective federal income tax returns as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   71   
24. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the statements
and representations set forth herein on behalf of Adaptive.   25. No
adaptive stockholder has guaranteed any Adaptive indebtedness that is
currently outstanding or will be outstanding at the Effective Time.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the undersigned makes
no representations regarding any actions or conduct of Adaptive pursuant
to Western\'s exercise of control over Adaptive after the Merger.   Very
truly yours,   Adaptive Broadband Corporation    By:
