letter of transmittal, duly executed,  and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange  Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive promptly  in exchange therefor (x) a certificate
representing that number of whole  Merger Shares, less the number of Merger
Shares (if any) to be held in  escrow pursuant to Section 3.3(e), and/or (y)
a check representing the  amount of cash required to be paid pursuant to
Section 3.3, including, cash  in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and  distributions with respect to the Corvis Shares as
provided for in Section  3.3(c), if any, that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the  Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III,  after giving effect to any required
withholding Tax. No interest will be  paid or accrued on the cash payable to
holders of Shares. In the event of a  transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer  records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of the  Corvis Shares, together with a check
for the cash to be paid pursuant to  this Section 3.3 may be issued to such a
transferee if such Certificate  shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and  the transferee shall pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of  the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such  Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Corvis that such Tax has  been paid or is not applicable. Corvis or the
Exchange Agent shall be  entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable  pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Corvis or the Exchange Agent is  required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment  under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Corvis or the Exchange Agent,  such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes   20     of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which  such deduction and withholding was made.   (ii)
Corvis will use its reasonable best efforts to provide  for a mechanism in
order to enable any holders of Company Equity that  deliver certificates for
Shares in registered form (duly endorsed for  transfer or accompanied by duly
executed stock powers) to Corvis (or the  Exchange Agent) on or prior to the
Closing Date, or are otherwise able to  establish their ownership of Company
Equity to the reasonable satisfaction  of Corvis (or the Exchange Agent) on
or prior to the Closing Date, to  receive, on the Closing Date, the Merger
Consideration payable with respect  to such Company Equity hereunder.   (c)
Dividends. No dividends or other distributions declared  with a record date
after the Effective Time on the Corvis Shares shall be  paid with respect to
any Shares represented by Certificates until such  Certificates are
surrendered for exchange as provided herein or a Person  claiming a
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed has complied with  the provisions
of Section 3.6. Promptly following surrender of any such  Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificates  representing whole Merger
Shares issued in exchange therefor, without  interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or  other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore  payable with respect to such whole
Merger Shares and not paid, less the  amount of any withholding Taxes which
may be required thereon, and (ii) at  the appropriate payment date or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the  amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the  Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to  such surrender payable with
respect to such whole Merger Shares, less the  amount of any withholding
Taxes which may be required thereon. Corvis will,  no later than the
applicable dividend or distribution payment dates,  provide the Exchange
Agent with the cash necessary to make the payments  contemplated by this
Section 3.3(c).   (d) No Fractional Securities. No fractional Corvis Shares
shall  be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional
share  of the Corvis Shares, cash adjustments will be paid to holders in
respect  of any fractional share of Merger Shares that would otherwise be
issuable,  and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to the
product  obtained by multiplying such stockholder\'s fractional share of the
Corvis  Shares that would otherwise be issuable by the Closing Corvis Share
Price.   (e) At a Closing at which any amounts remain in dispute or have 
not otherwise been finally determined under Article X, Corvis shall deposit 
into an escrow at the Closing with an escrow agent, and pursuant to an 
escrow agreement, reasonably acceptable to the Company and Corvis, a stock 
certificate, together with stock powers duly endorsed in blank for  transfer,
representing the number of Merger Shares equal to the total  amount remaining
in dispute or not finally determined under Article X  hereof divided by the
Effective Corvis Share Price, or, in the event the  Merger Consideration is
paid in cash pursuant to Section 3.2(d), cash  representing the total amount
remaining in dispute or not finally  determined under Article X hereof, in
each case which amounts will be held  in escrow pending resolution of such
disputes to be distributed thereafter  in   21     accordance with
Section 3.3 and/or Article X hereof. The Company and Corvis  shall use each
its good faith best efforts to agree upon and execute the  above-referenced
escrow agreement (if necessary, as provided above) prior  to the Closing. All
Merger Consideration placed into escrow pursuant to  this Section 3.3(e)
shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration  otherwise distributable to
the Focal stockholders at Closing under Section  3.2(c), (d) and (e).   (f)
No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. All Merger  Consideration delivered
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in  accordance with the terms
of this Article III (including any cash paid  pursuant to this Section 3.3)
shall be deemed to have been issued in full  satisfaction of all rights
(except obligations under the Plan with respect  to Disputed Claims, which
shall become obligations of the Surviving  Corporation, and which are
expected to be satisfied by distributions of  Company Equity (or after the
Effective Time, Merger Consideration) from the  Claims Escrow in accordance
with Section 3.2(e)(vi)) pertaining to the  Shares, theretofore represented
by such Certificates. At the Effective  Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there  shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books  of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time,  Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange  Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in  this Article III.   (g) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange  Fund (including the proceeds of
any investments thereof and any Merger  Shares) which remains undistributed
to the holders of Shares on the later  of the date (x) that is six (6) months
after the Closing Date or (y) on  which all Disputed Claims have been
resolved pursuant to the Plan may be  delivered to Corvis, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not  theretofore complied with this Article
III and the instructions set forth  in the letter of transmittal mailed to
such holders after the Effective  Time shall thereafter look only to Corvis
or its agent (subject to  abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
for payment of their  Merger Consideration, cash and unpaid dividends and
distributions on Merger  Shares deliverable in respect of each Share such
stockholder holds as  determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest  thereon.   (h) Under the Company\'s Second Amended
and Restated Certificate  of Incorporation each holder of record of Shares
has waived its rights to  pursue appraisal rights under the DGCL to the
extent permitted by  Applicable Law. If, and to the extent, any holder of
record of Shares that  may be entitled to appraisal rights under DGCL with
respect to the Merger  has properly exercised and perfected such appraisal
rights pursuant to and  in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, such
holder shall, to the  extent allowed under Applicable Law, be entitled to an
appraisal by the  Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair value of such Shares
as provided in  Section 262 of the DGCL, provided that such stockholder acts
in accordance  with and meets all the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL. If a holder  of record of Shares who is entitled to appraisal rights
elects to demand  the appraisal of such Shares fails to act in accordance
with and meet all  the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, such
stockholder shall be  deemed   22     not to have elected to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder\'s Shares  and shall be entitled only to the
consideration in respect of such Shares  provided for in Section 3.2. Corvis
will comply with any information  delivery or other requirements of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation  as are required under Applicable Law in
connection with any such rights  (including delivery of all material
information as is required by  Applicable Law to be provided to any
stockholder that may be entitled to  appraisal rights under the DGCL to
enable them to determine whether to  exercise such appraisal rights if, and
to the extent, such appraisal rights  are available under the DGCL).   (i)
No Liability. None of Corvis, Sub, the Company or the  Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any amount  properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable  abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   Section 3.4 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties
hereto that, unless the Merger Consideration is paid in cash pursuant to
Section 3.2(d) above, the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the parties hereto adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" for such purposes and shall make all
filings with the IRS consistent with such intention.   Section 3.5
Adjustment of Merger Shares. In the event that Corvis changes or establishes
a record date for changing the number of the Corvis Shares issued and
outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding the Corvis Shares and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the number of Merger
Shares and any other calculations based on or relating to Merger Shares,
including the Signing Corvis Share Price, shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination or similar transaction.   Section 3.6 Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Corvis or the
Exchange Agent (but only in the case of a natural person), the posting by
such natural person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Corvis or the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Corvis
Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Corvis Shares to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.3(c).   Section 3.7 Further Assurances. If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties, permits, licenses or assets of either of the Constituent
Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their
designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all   23    such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name
and on behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and
things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm
the Surviving Corporation\'s right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such
Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

respect to, Corvis\'s capital stock;   (iv) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of
or encumber any shares  of, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or

as in effect on the  date hereof, (B) Corvis Shares issuable under Corvis

by any  direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Corvis of its capital
stock  to Corvis or another wholly-owned Subsidiary of Corvis, (D) the

issuance of  Corvis Shares (not to exceed $250 million in market value,
determined at  the time of issuance, in the aggregate under this subclause
(E)) either as  consideration in acquisitions or in exchange for cash that is
used as  consideration in acquisitions in each case permitted by clause (v)
below;  or grant any Person registration rights with respect to the foregoing
that  may be exercised prior to or are otherwise superior in any respect to
the  obligations of Corvis to file and cause to be declared effective the 
Registration Statements with respect to the Merger Shares;   (v) enter into
any agreement to acquire or purchase, or  acquire or purchase, (whether by
merger, acquisition of equity or assets,  joint venture or otherwise) any
Person or any interest in any Person (other  than market purchases of
publicly traded securities constituting less than  5% of the outstanding
capital stock of any Person for investment purposes)  if such acquisition or
purchase (A) requires the Company to pay or remit  cash to such Persons or
their assignees in connection with that transaction  (other than cash
received after the date hereof upon issuance of Corvis  capital stock
pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(iv)(E)) or (B) would cause a  material delay in or
prevent   41     the receipt of any antitrust or competition law
approval or other  regulatory approval necessary for the consummation of, or
otherwise  adversely affect, the Merger or Corvis\'s ability to consummate
the Merger,  unless such action would not be reasonably expected to cause
such effect;   (vi) own less than $250,000,000 in unrestricted and 
unencumbered Cash, except with respect to the amounts in the Reserve Fund; 
or   (vii) repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire, or prepay or  make
other advance payment in respect of, any indebtedness or debt or  equity
securities (except for repurchases and redemptions made in  accordance with
the Corvis Stock Incentive Plans);   Section 6.2 No Solicitation.   (a)
Commencing on the date hereof and except as provided in  Section 9.2(a)(i)
below and this Section 6.2, the Company shall not, nor  shall it permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it or its  Subsidiaries authorize or permit
any of their respective officers,  directors, employees, representatives or
agents to, directly or indirectly,  (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage any inquiries regarding, or  the making of any proposal which
constitutes, any Takeover Proposal, or  (ii) enter into any letter of intent
or agreement related to any Takeover  Proposal other than a confidentiality
agreement (each, an "Acquisition  Agreement"). If, at any time prior to the
date of the Company Stockholder  Approval, the Company receives a Takeover
Proposal from any Person that in  the good faith judgment of the Company\'s
Board of Directors is, or is  reasonably likely to lead to the delivery of, a
Superior Proposal, the  Company may (x) furnish information (including non-
public information) with  respect to the Company to any such Person pursuant
to a confidentiality  agreement (which, in the case of a confidentiality
agreement entered into  after the date hereof, will contain confidentiality
provisions no more  favorable to such Person than those in the
Confidentiality Agreement) and  (y) participate in negotiations with such
Person regarding such Takeover  Proposal; provided, however, that if the
Company does not, within five (5)  days after any such good faith
determination of the Company\'s Board of  Directors that a Takeover Proposal
is, or is reasonably likely to lead to  the delivery of, a Superior Proposal,
provide notice of such determination  to Corvis (together with a general
description of the material terms and  conditions of such Takeover Proposal,
then the Company may no longer  furnish such information or participate in
such negotiations with respect  to such Takeover Proposal. The notice
referred to in the foregoing sentence  need not identify the Person making
the Takeover Proposal if such  identification would be prohibited by any
confidentiality obligation  binding on the Company. In addition to the
restrictions imposed pursuant to  the foregoing requirements of this
subsection (a), following the date of  the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall not, nor shall it  permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall
it or its Subsidiaries  authorize or permit any of their respective officers,
directors, employees,  representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly,
furnish information  (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company or any of  its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to a Takeover
Proposal or  participate in negotiations with any Person regarding a Takeover
Proposal.  For purposes of this Agreement,   42     "Takeover Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person  (other than Corvis and
its Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect  acquisition or purchase
of 25% or more of the assets of the Company and its  Subsidiaries or 25% or
more of the voting power of the capital stock of the  Company or the capital
stock of such Subsidiaries then outstanding, any  tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any  Person beneficially owning 25%
or more of the voting power of the capital  stock of the Company or the
capital stock of such Subsidiaries then  outstanding, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination,  recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving  the Company, other than the
transactions with Corvis and Sub contemplated  by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal"  means any bona fide
Takeover Proposal made by any Person (other than Corvis  and its Affiliates)
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration  consisting of cash
and/or securities, more than 50% of the voting power of  the Shares then
outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the  Company and
otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company  determines in
good faith would, or would be reasonably likely to, be more  favorable to the
stockholders of the Company (taking into account such  factors as the
Company\'s Board of Directors in good faith deems relevant,  including the
identity of the offeror and all legal, financial, regulatory  and other
aspects of the proposal, including the form and value of  consideration, the
terms of any financing and the likelihood that the  transaction will be
consummated) than the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Except as set
forth in Section 9.2(a)(i) and subject to the  Company\'s Board of
Directors\' exercise of its fiduciary duties, neither the  Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)  withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse  to Corvis, the approval
or recommendation by such Board of Directors or  such committee of the Merger
or this Agreement; or (ii) recommend, or  propose to recommend, any Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  subject to Section 9.2(a)(i), the
Company will solicit the Company Written  Consent and the Voting Agreement
whether or not the Board of Directors of  the Company determines at any time
that this Agreement is no longer  advisable and recommends against it.  
(c) The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall, and  the Company
shall direct its and its Subsidiaries\' respective officers,  directors,
employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and  cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations with any  Persons with
respect to any Takeover Proposal.   Section 6.3 Disclosure of Certain
Matters; Delivery of Certain Filings.   (a) From the date hereof until the
Interim Determination Date,  the Company shall promptly notify Corvis orally
and in writing if a  representation or warranty contained herein shall no
longer be true and  correct in all material respects as of the date when made
or as of the date  of such notice or if there occurs, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any  change or event which results in the executive officers of the
Company  having a good faith belief that such change or event has resulted
in, or is   43     reasonably likely to result in, a representation or
warranty contained  herein no longer being true and correct in all material
respects as of the  date when made or as of the date of such notice. Unless
such notice would  give Corvis the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section  9.2(b)(i) by reason of such notice and Corvis exercises such
right to  terminate this Agreement within the period referred to in such
Section  9.2(b)(i) then the written notice pursuant to this Section 6.3(a)
shall be  deemed to have amended the Company Letter, to have qualified the 
representations and warranties contained in Article IV, and to have cured 
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have 
existed hereunder by reason of such change or event.   (b) From the date
hereof until the Interim Determination Date,  the Company shall provide to
Corvis, and Corvis shall provide to the  Company, copies of all filings made
by the Company or Corvis, as the case  may be, with any Governmental Entity
in connection with this Agreement and  the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (c) From the date hereof until the Interim Determination Date, 
Corvis shall promptly advise the Company orally and in writing if a 
representation or warranty contained herein shall no longer be true and 
correct in all material respects as of the date when made or as of the date 
of such notice or if there occurs, to the Knowledge of Corvis, any change  or
event which results in the executive officers of Corvis having a good  faith
belief that such change or event has resulted in, or is reasonably  likely to
result in, a representation or warranty contained herein shall no  longer be
true and correct in all material respects as of the date when  made or as of
the date of such notice. Unless such notice would give the  Company the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i)  by reason of such
notice and the Company exercises such right to terminate  this Agreement
within the period referred to in such Section 9.2(c)(i),  then the written
notice pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) shall be deemed to  have amended the
Corvis Letter, to have qualified the representations and  warranties
contained in Article V, and to have cured any misrepresentation  or breach of
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason  of such
change or event.   (d) From the date hereof until the Interim Determination
Date,  each of Corvis and the Company shall promptly notify the other Party
if it  or one of its Subsidiaries becomes aware of any breach by such other
Party  of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this 
Agreement.   Section 6.4 Conduct of Business of Sub Pending the Merger.
During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
Sub shall not engage in any activity or incur any liabilities or obligations
of any nature except as expressly provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 6.5 NASDAQ Listing. Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, Corvis shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Corvis
Shares issuable in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ
National Market.   44     ARTICLE VII  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  
Section 7.1 Options. At the Effective Time, the Company shall cancel
all outstanding Company Stock Options, at which time each holder of In-the-
Money Company Stock Options will have the right to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration specified in Section 3.2.   Section 7.2
Stockholder Approval; Other Actions.   (a) No later than thirty (30) days
following the date hereof, the  Company shall solicit the written consent, in
the form attached hereto as  Exhibit H (the "Company Written Consent"), of
the holders of at least  sixty-seven percent (67%) of the outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred  Stock and holders of fifty one percent (51%) of the
Company Common Stock  (if any) (with the Series A Preferred Stock voting on
an as-if-converted  basis) in lieu of a special meeting of its stockholders
(the signing and  delivery to the Company of such written consent, the
"Company Stockholder  Approval"). In connection with solicitation of the
Company Stockholder  Approval, the Company shall submit a voting agreement,
in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit D (the "Voting Agreement") for
execution and delivery to  Corvis by the stockholders executing the Company
Written Consent. The  Company shall, through its Board of Directors (but
subject to the right of  the Company to terminate this Agreement as set forth
in Section 9.2(a)(i)  and the exercise of the Company\'s Board of Directors\'
fiduciary duties),  recommend to its stockholders that the Company
Stockholder Approval be  given. Subject to Section 9.2(a)(i), the Company
will solicit the Company  Written Consent and the Voting Agreement whether or
not the Board of  Directors of the Company determines at any time that this
Agreement is no  longer advisable and recommends against it.   (b) No later
than thirty (30) days following the date hereof, the  Company will (provided
that Corvis has fulfilled its obligations under  Sections 7.2 and 7.10) (i)
solicit the Series A Preferred Consent, (ii)  give the holders of the Company
Warrants notice of the Merger as required  by and in accordance with Section
3.6 of the Warrant Agreement, and (iii)  give the holders of options issued
pursuant to the 2003 Equity and  Performance Incentive Plan the required
notice of the Merger.   (c) Corvis shall provide to the Company all
necessary information  about Corvis and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to enable  the Company to provide all necessary information to
holders of Company  Equity in connection with a required notice or consent.
In the event the  Company delivers any notice of the transaction to the
holders of Company  Equity in accordance with Rule 135 promulgated under the
Exchange Act,  Corvis agrees that it will timely file such notice and other
information  with the SEC as required under Rule 425 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.   Section 7.3 Preparation of Registration Statement.  
45     (a) Corvis shall promptly prepare (in consultation with the 
Company) and file with the SEC a registration statement and information 
statement on Form S-4, which registration statement and information 
statement shall comply in all material respects with all Applicable Laws 
respecting securities, including rules and regulations promulgated by the 
SEC, and shall solicit the written consent of the Company\'s stockholders to 
the transaction as may be necessary to reaffirm the Merger and this 
Agreement (such registration statement in compliance with this Section 7.3, 
the "S-4 Registration Statement"). Each of the Company and Corvis shall use 
its reasonable best efforts to file such S-4 Registration Statement on or 
prior to July 1, 2004 and to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared 
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such 
filing and use reasonable best efforts to keep the S-4 Registration 
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. If 
Corvis is not able to include the Merger Shares issuable to those Focal 
stockholders who delivered the Company Written Consent in the S-4 
Registration Statement, Corvis shall promptly prepare (in consultation with 
the Company) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 
covering the resale of all such Merger Shares that could not be so included 
in the S-4 Registration Statement, which registration statement and 
information statement shall comply in all material respects with all 
Applicable Laws respecting securities, including rules and regulations 
promulgated by the SEC, (such registration statement in compliance with  this
Section 7.3, the "S-3 Registration Statement" and together with the  S-4
Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements"). The S-3  Registration
Statement shall register the resale of the Merger Shares by  the initial
distributees of those shares pursuant to Section 3.2. The S-3  Registration
Statement shall also register the distribution by such initial  distributees
who are partnerships of their Merger Shares to their limited  and general
partners and the resale of such shares by such partners. Corvis  shall use
its reasonable best efforts to file supplements to such S-3  Registration
Statement as soon as practicable after it is notified of any  such
distribution for which any such supplement is required, which  supplements
will enable such partners of the initial distributees to resell  the Merger
Shares that have been so distributed to them by the initial  distributees.
Corvis agrees that it will cooperate and take such actions as  may be
reasonably requested by any initial distributee and subject to  compliance
with Applicable Law to enable such initial distributee to  transfer the
Merger Shares to such partners. Corvis shall use its  reasonable best efforts
to file such S-3 Registration Statement as soon as  practicable after it is
notified that Corvis will not be able to include  certain Merger Shares in
the S-4 Registration Statement and to have the S-3  Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as  promptly as practicable after
such filing and use reasonable best efforts  to keep the S-3 Registration
Statement effective for a period ending on the  earlier of (i) the second
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date  on which all Merger Shares
have been sold pursuant to the S-3 Registration  Statement. If Corvis cannot
deliver registered Merger Shares pursuant to an  effective S-4 Registration
Statement (or if any Merger Share are covered by  an S-3 Registration
Statement in accordance with this Section 7.3, Corvis  cannot deliver the
Merger Shares covered thereunder, the resale of which is  registered pursuant
to an effective S-3 Registration Statement) at a  Closing on or before the
Outside Date, then (unless the Company delivers  the written notice set forth
in Section 3.2(d)(i)) upon delivery of cash   46     consideration in
lieu of Merger Shares Corvis shall be under no further  obligation to have
the Registration Statements declared or remain  effective.   (b) Corvis
shall (in consultation with the Company) include in  the S-4 Registration
Statement filed with the SEC provisions regarding the  registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to Rule 415 under the  Securities Act (the "Shelf
Registration") covering the resale of Corvis  Shares received by affiliates
(as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under  the Securities Act) of the
Company and which are subject to restrictions on  resale under Rule 145 under
the Securities Act. Each of the Company and  Corvis shall use its reasonable
best efforts to include the Shelf  Registration provisions in the S-4
Registration Statement and to cause it  to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as  practicable after such filing and use
reasonable best efforts to keep the  Shelf Registration effective for a
period ending on the earlier of (i) the  second anniversary of the Closing
Date and (ii) the date on which all  Corvis Shares have been sold pursuant to
the Shelf Registration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Corvis is not able
to include all of the  Merger Shares issuable to the Focal stockholders who
delivered the Company  Written Consent referred to this Section 7.3(b) in the
S-4 Registration  Statement, Corvis shall comply with the registration
requirements under  Section 7.3(a) or deliver (at the Company\'s election)
cash in accordance  with Section 3.2(d).   (c) No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, any of the  Registration Statements, and no correspondence
with the SEC with respect  thereto, will be made by Corvis or the Company
without providing the other  party the opportunity to review and comment
thereon. Corvis will advise the  Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when any of  the Registration Statements has become
effective or any supplement or  amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of  the qualification of the Merger Shares
issuable in connection with the  Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC  for amendment of any of the
Registration Statements or comments thereon and  responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at  any time prior to the
Closing Date any information relating to Corvis or  the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,  should be discovered by
Corvis or the Company which should be set forth in  an amendment or
supplement to any of the Registration Statements, so that  any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact  or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements  therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly  notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement  describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to  the extent required
by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Corvis and  the Company.   (d)
Each of the Company and Corvis each shall use commercially  reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered a letter of its independent  auditors, dated
(i) the date two business days prior to the date on which  any of the
Registration Statements shall become effective and (ii) the  Closing Date,
and addressed to the other party and its directors, in form  and substance
customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent  public accountants
in connection with registration statements similar to  the Registration
Statements.   47     (e) Notwithstanding to the contrary in this Section
7.3, if, at  any time during which a prospectus for an S-3 Registration
Statement or  Shelf Registration is required to be delivered in connection
with the sale  of any Merger Shares, Corvis reasonably determines in good
faith and upon  the advice of its outside legal counsel that a development
has occurred or  a condition exists as a result of which the prospectus
contains a material  misstatement or omission, or that a material transaction
in which Corvis is  engaged or proposes to engage would require an amendment
to the prospectus  or registration statement, a supplement to the applicable
registration  statement and related prospectus, or a filing under the
Exchange Act or  other public disclosure of material information and the
disclosure of such  transaction would be materially premature or materially
injurious to the  consummation of the transaction, Corvis will promptly so
notify in writing  the stockholders whose Merger Shares are included in the
Shelf Registration  and/or the S-3 Registration. Upon receipt of such
notification, the  stockholders whose Merger Shares are included in the Shelf
Registration  and/or the S-3 Registration and their affiliates will
immediately suspend  all offers and sales of Merger Shares pursuant to the
Registration  Statement. In such event, Corvis will amend or supplement the
applicable  registration statement and related prospectus or make such
filings or  public disclosures as promptly as practicable consistent with
the  restrictions set forth in this subsection (e) and will use its best
efforts  to take such other steps as may be required to permit sales of the
Merger  Shares thereunder by the stockholders whose Merger Shares are
included in  the Shelf Registration and/or the S-3 Registration and its
affiliates in  accordance with applicable federal and state securities laws
as promptly as  practicable. Corvis will promptly notify the stockholders
whose Merger  Shares are included in the Shelf Registration and/or the S-3
Registration  after it has determined in good faith that such sales have
become  permissible in such manner and will promptly deliver copies of the 
prospectus (as so amended or supplemented, if applicable) to the 
stockholders whose Merger Shares are included in the Shelf Registration 
and/or the S-3 Registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no 
circumstances will Corvis be entitled to exercise its right to suspend  sales
of any Merger Shares as provided in this Section 7.3(e) and pursuant  to the
Registration Statements (x) at all during the thirty (30) trading  days
immediately following the Closing Date, (y) more than once in the  thirty
(30) trading days immediately subsequent to the 30-trading days  immediately
following the Closing Date or for a period of greater than five  (5) trading
days during such second 30-trading day period, or (z) more than  twice or for
a period greater than forty-five (45) days in any twelve-month  period after
the fifty (50) trading days immediately subsequent to the  Closing Date.  
Section 7.4 Access to Information. Subject to the additional obligations
of the Company as provided in the Management Agreement, upon reasonable
notice and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
November 4, 2003, between the Company and Corvis, as the same may be amended,
supplemented or modified (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), each of Company
and Corvis shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the other party, and its respective officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives all reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and,
during such period, each of Company and Corvis shall (and shall cause each of
its respective Subsidiaries to) make available to the other party or its
designated   48    advisors (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities laws
or the federal Tax laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request;
provided, however, that such reasonable access shall not unduly interfere
with the business of such Party; and provided further, no Party shall have
any obligation to provide access to or make available any proprietary or
competitively sensitive information in violation of Applicable Laws relating
to antitrust or securities or the regulation of their respective businesses
or any information or document subject to the attorney-client, work product
or other privilege the waiver of which would be effected thereby; and
provided further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as set forth
in and subject to compliance with the Management Agreement, neither Corvis
nor any of its Affiliates, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates,
as the case may be, shall contact or correspond with (i) any customer or
supplier of the other party regarding that party or its Subsidiaries or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any employee of the
other party or its Subsidiaries (other than senior executive employees
specifically authorized as contact persons by the party) in each case without
the prior written consent of the other party and subject to the right of the
other party to have representatives present during any such contact and
review any such correspondence with its employees, customers or suppliers. In
the event of a termination of this Agreement for any reason, each party shall
promptly return or destroy, or cause to be returned or destroyed, all
nonpublic information so obtained from the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries.   Section 7.5 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly
contemplated hereby, or by any other written agreement entered into by Corvis
and the Company, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.   Section 7.6 Public Announcements. The Parties shall
jointly prepare and issue a press release publicly announcing the signing of
this Agreement; provided, however, that any Party may make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the other
Party prior to making the disclosure and afford such other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon). As soon as practicable, but in
any event within five (5) days, after signing of this Agreement, Corvis shall
file a report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing the signing of this
Agreement, attaching this Agreement and any exhibits that would be material
to Corvis\'s stockholders, and the Company shall have a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such report prior to filing.   Section

the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which
become payable by the Company, Corvis or Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related
interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer Taxes"). All Transfer
Taxes shall be paid by the Company (which expressly shall not be a liability
of any holder of capital stock of the Company or result in any reduction in
the Merger Consideration).   49     Section 7.8 State Takeover Laws. If
any "fair price" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Corvis, Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as

and Officers Insurance.   (a) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, Corvis  shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to  indemnify and exculpate each director, officer, employee or
agent of the  Company and its Subsidiaries (an "Indemnified Person") for any
and all  actions taken or not taken by such Indemnified Person on or prior to
the  Closing to the fullest extent and in the same manner as Corvis
provides  indemnification to its own directors and officers pursuant to its 
Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on the date hereof. In addition 
and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event 
that any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened 
action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this paragraph 
after the Effective Time, Corvis shall, or shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation to, promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her  legal
and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and  preparation
incurred in connection therewith), subject to the providing by  such
Indemnified Person of an undertaking, which shall not be required to  be
secured, to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a 
nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such 
Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto. Corvis shall obtain appropriate 
riders for such DandO; Insurance policy, or take such other actions as may be 
necessary, in order to have the Persons currently covered under the 
Company\'s existing DandO; Insurance policy named as additional insureds under 
such DandO; Insurance policy.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Corvis shall
obtain a separate  officers\' and directors\' liability insurance ("DandO;
Insurance") covering the  Persons currently covered under the Company\'s
existing DandO; Insurance policy  on terms and conditions no less favorable to
such Persons than those in  effect on the date hereof under the existing DandO;
Insurance policy of Corvis  and covering such Persons for a period of not
less than six (6) years  commencing on the Closing Date. All premiums due and
payable by Corvis up  to a total premium of $500,000 (with any excess being
payable by the  Company) for the six year period of such DandO; Insurance
policy shall have  been paid at Closing by Corvis (or the Company, if
applicable) in full  prior to the Effective Time.   (c) The provisions of
this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the  benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or  her heirs and his or her
personal representatives and shall be binding on  all successors and assigns
of Corvis, the Company and the Surviving  Corporation.   Section 7.10
Appropriate Actions; Consents; Filings.   50     (a) The Company and
Corvis shall cooperate with each other and  use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best  efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions, and do or cause to be  done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this  Agreement and Applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger  and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as  practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all  documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and other filings  and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations,  approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained  from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate  the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  As promptly as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this  Agreement the Parties
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and  filed, the necessary
application or applications with the FCC seeking any  FCC Consent and with
the States seeking any State PUC Consents required by  any Applicable Laws.
Each Party shall provide the other party with all  information necessary for
the preparation of such applications on a timely  basis, including those
portions of such applications which are required to  be completed by the
first Party. Each party hereto shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts
to refrain from knowingly taking any action  that would cause the FCC or any
State PUC or other regulatory authority not  to grant the FCC consent or any
State PUC Consents. If any administrative  or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be  instituted), including by a private
party, to prohibit the Merger, the  Company and Corvis shall use their
reasonable best efforts to avoid the  institution of any such action or
proceeding and to contest and resist any  such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or  overturned any temporary, preliminary or
permanent decree, judgment,  injunction or other order that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents,  delays or restricts consummation of the Merger (it
being understood that  the foregoing obligation of the parties hereto will
cease in the event a  permanent decree, judgment, injunction or other order
is issued or is in  effect that is non-appealable and prohibits, prevents,
delays or restricts  consummation of the Merger).   (b) Subject to
Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of  information, Corvis and the
Company shall have the right to review in  advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all  the information relating to
Corvis or the Company, as the case may be, and  any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with,  or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental  Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of  the Company and Corvis shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable.   (c) Subject to Applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of  information, the Company and Corvis each shall,
upon request by the other,  furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries,  directors, officers and stockholders and such
other matters as may be  reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
the Registration  Statements or Disclosure Document or any other statement,
filing, notice or  application made by or on behalf of Corvis, the Company or
any of their  respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity  in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.   51     (d) The Company and Corvis
each shall keep the other apprised of  the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions  contemplated hereby (including Corvis keeping
the Company apprised of the  status of developments relating to its ability
to deliver registered Corvis  Shares at Closing), including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of  notice or other communications received
by Corvis or the Company, as the  case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries,
from any third party and/or any  Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and Corvis each shall give  prompt notice to the other of any change
that is reasonably likely to  result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or Corvis, respectively.  Neither the Company nor Corvis shall permit
any of its officers, employees  or any other representatives or agents to
participate in any meeting with  any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other  inquiry relating to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the  extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the  opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.   Section 7.11 Section 16 Matters. The Board of Directors of the
Company and Corvis shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions,
if any, as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule
16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt (i) the conversion of Company
Equity into the Corvis Shares and (ii) the acquisition of the Corvis Shares
and the right to receive the Corvis Shares pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement by officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees or
directors of the Company who may become an officer or director of Corvis
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
Corvis and the Company shall provide to counsel to the other party copies of
the resolutions to be adopted by the respective Boards of Directors to
implement the foregoing.   Section 7.12 Continuity of Business Enterprise.

within the meaning of Reg. (S)1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), or (ii) to a partnership if

substantial management functions as a partner with respect to the Company\'s

aggregate own an interest in the partnership representing a significant
interest in the Company\'s historic business, in each case within the meaning
of Reg. (S)1.368-1(d)(4)(iii).   Section 7.13 Break-up Fee. In the event
that the Company or Corvis terminates this Agreement pursuant to the
provisions of Sections 9.1(d) or (e) or 9.2(a)(i), the Company shall pay to
Corvis a break-up fee of $5,000,000 in cash (the "Break-up Fee") within
thirty (30) business days of such termination. If the Break-up Fee is not
paid when due, such amount shall accrue interest at a rate of eight percent
(8%) per annum. If Corvis is required to commence collection efforts to
collect the Break-up Fee after it is due, the Company shall reimburse Corvis
for all out-of-pocket costs it incurs in the collection of such amounts,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees.   52     Section 7.14 Reserve
Fund. On or prior to the Interim Determination Date, Corvis shall deposit,
into a segregated depository account selected by Corvis, $110 million in cash

termination of this Agreement and, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company
in writing, the funds contained therein shall be used solely for the payment
of the Merger Consideration in the event that Corvis is unable to deliver
Merger Shares at Closing, in accordance with the terms of Section 3.2. In the
event that Corvis delivers to the Company a written agreement signed by
a third party evidencing such party\'s commitment to engage in the
Alternative Method, the terms of which are satisfactory to the Company, it is
sole discretion (the "Third Party Commitment"), the Company shall be
permitted to eliminate the Reserve Fund and any amounts contained therein
shall no longer we subject to any restrictions hereunder, subject to
Corvis\'s continued compliance with Section 6.1(c)(vi).   ARTICLE VIII

the notice to Corvis required  thereby and (y) to notify Corvis promptly in
writing if its intention to  enter into a definitive agreement referred to in

6.3(a) with respect to  breaches that are the subject of such notice) on or
prior to, but at no  time after, the Interim Determination Date, if (A) there
has been a breach  of any representation or warranty made by the Company
under this Agreement,  or if any representation or warranty made by the
Company under this  Agreement is not true and correct as of the Interim

inaccuracies in respect of such  representations and warranties, taking all
breaches and inaccuracies in  respect or all such representations and
warranties together in their  entirety, result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and such  inaccuracies and the Material Adverse Effect
thereof are not curable or, if  curable, are not cured by the date which is
30 days after written notice  thereof is given by Corvis to the Company.

Company on or prior to, but at no time after, the Interim  Determination

of its material obligations, or has failed to comply in  all material
respects with any of its material agreements or material  covenants to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Interim  Determination Date
under this Agreement and the Management Agreement, and  such failure to
perform or comply has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect  on the Company,
and such failure to perform or comply and the Material  Adverse Effect
thereof are not curable or, if curable, are not cured by the  date which is
30 days after written notice thereof is given by Corvis to  the Company.  
If Corvis does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant 
to Section 9.2(b)(i) or (ii) above within the time periods and in  accordance

accordance with Section 9.3 below with respect to breaches by  the Company of
its obligations hereunder which occur following the Interim  Determination
Date or (subject to the limitations otherwise set forth in  this/ Agreement)
indemnification under Article X.   58     (c) Company Termination on or

terminated by the Company, by  written notice to Corvis (which notice may not
be delivered more than ten  (10) days after receipt of any notice pursuant to
Section 6.3(c) with  respect to breaches that are the subject of such notice)
on or prior to,  but at no time after, the Interim Determination Date, if (A)
there has been  a breach of any representation or warranty made by Corvis
under this  Agreement, or if any representation or warranty made by Corvis
under this  Agreement is not true and correct as of the Interim Determination
Date as  if then made (except representations and warranties that expressly
speak as  of a specified date, which shall only be true and correct to such
extent as  of such date), and (B) the breaches or inaccuracies in respect of
such  representations and warranties, taking all breaches and inaccuracies
in  respect of all such representations and warranties together in their 
entirety, result in a Material Adverse Effect on Corvis, and such breaches 
and inaccuracies and the Material Adverse Effect thereof are not curable  or,
if curable, are not cured by the date which is 30 days after written  notice
thereof is given by the Company to Corvis.   (ii) This Agreement may be
terminated by the Company, by  written notice to Corvis on or prior to, but
at no time after, the Interim  Determination Date, if Corvis has failed to
perform in all material  respects any of its material obligations, or has
failed to comply in all  material respects with any of its material
agreements or material covenants  to be performed or complied with by it
prior to the Interim Determination  Date under this Agreement and the
Management Agreement, and such failure to  perform or comply has resulted in
a Material Adverse Effect on Corvis, and  such failure to perform or comply
and the Material Adverse Effect thereof  are not curable or, if curable, are
not cured by the date which is 30 days  after written notice thereof is given
by the Company to Corvis.   If the Company does not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(i) or (ii) above within
the time periods and in  accordance with the notice requirements referenced
in this Section 9.2(c),  it shall waive and release any and all rights to
terminate this Agreement  as a result thereof. The foregoing sentence shall
not be construed to waive  or release the right of the Company to terminate
the Agreement in  accordance with Section 9.3 below with respect to breaches
by Corvis of its  obligations hereunder which occur following the Interim
Determination Date  or (subject to the limitations otherwise set forth in
this Agreement)  indemnification under Article X.   Section 9.3 Termination
After the Interim Determination Date. This Agreement may be terminated after
the Interim Determination Date (unless otherwise noted):   (a) by either
Corvis or the Company, if the Merger shall not have  been consummated by the
Outside Date; provided, however, that the right to  terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.3 shall not be available to  any party whose failure to
fulfill of any obligation under this Agreement  has been the cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on  or before the Outside Date
(it being understood that   59     Corvis may not terminate this
Agreement if the failure to deliver  registered Merger Shares (and in the
case of an S-3 Registration Statement,  if the failure to deliver Merger
Shares, the resale of which is registered)  is the cause of such
failure);   (b) by Corvis, upon written notice to the Company, if the
Company  has failed to perform in all material respects any of its material 
obligations, or has failed to comply in all material respects with any of 
its material agreements or material covenants, of the Company to be 
performed or complied with by it after the Interim Determination Date under 
this Agreement and the Management Agreement, and such failure to perform or 
comply has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and such 
failure to perform or comply and the Material Adverse Effect thereof are  not
curable or, if curable, are not cured by the date which is thirty (30)  days
after written notice thereof is given by Corvis to the Company  (subject to
Section 9.3(a)); or   (c) by the Company, upon written notice to Corvis, if
Corvis has  failed to perform in all material respects any of its material
obligations,  or has failed to comply in all material respects with any of
its material  agreements or material covenants, to be performed or complied
with by it  after the Interim Determination Date under this Agreement and
the  Management Agreement, and such failure to perform or comply has resulted
in  a Material Adverse Effect on Corvis, and such failure to perform or
comply  and the Material Adverse Effect thereof are not curable or, if
curable, are  not cured by the date which is thirty (30) days after written
notice  thereof is given by the Company to Corvis (subject to Section
9.3(a)).   Section 9.4 Effect of Termination. In the event of a termination
of this Agreement by either the Company or Corvis as provided this Article
Ix, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Corvis, Sub or the Company or their
respective officers or directors, except with respect to Section 4.20
(Brokers), Section 5.14 (Brokers), Section 7.5 (Fees and Expenses), Section
7.6 (Public Announcements), this Section 9.4 and Article XI and the last
sentence of Section 7.4 (Access to Information); provided, however, that
nothing herein shall relieve any party for liability for (i) any material
breach of any representation or warranty hereunder prior to the date of
termination, (ii) any material breach of any covenant hereunder prior to the
date of termination, or (iii) the Company\'s obligation to pay the Break-up
Fee set forth in Section 7.13.   Section 9.5 Amendment. This Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time
(either before or after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval), but if
the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, thereafter no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by the
Company\'s stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. No course of performance or course of
dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement
shall be deemed effective to modify, amend, waive or discharge any part of
this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason
of this Agreement.   Section 9.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Board of Directors, may, to the extent   60    legally
allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein; provided, however, that such extension or waiver
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.   ARTICLE X  INDEMNIFICATION  
Section 10.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Agreements.
The representations and warranties in Articles IV and V of this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive for a
period of sixty (60) days following the Interim Determination Date. As a
result, any claim by any Buyer Party that the Company is liable under this
Agreement for the breach of any representation or warranty must be given in
writing in accordance with Section 10.4 to the Company (or not at all) on or
prior to the date that is sixty (60) days after the Interim Determination
Date, and no such notice shall be given after such date. This Section 10.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Interim Determination Date.   Section
10.2 General Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company shall indemnify Corvis and its
Affiliates, stockholders, officers, directors, employees, successors and
permitted assigns (individually a "Buyer Party" and collectively the "Buyer
Parties") for any loss, liability, demand, claim, action, cause of action,
cost, damage, penalty, fine or expense (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses, court costs, and other costs of
suit) (collectively, "Losses") which any such Buyer Party may suffer, sustain
or become subject to, as a result of (a) any breach of a representation or
warranty under Article IV of this Agreement and (b) any breach of a covenant
or agreement by the Company under this Agreement.   Section 10.3
Limitations on Indemnity.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein,  the Company shall not have any liability under Section
10.2 with respect to  any Loss until the amount of such Loss that the Buyer
Parties in the  aggregate have actually suffered, sustained or become subject
to exceeds $1  million (an "Indemnifiable Loss"), in which case the Company
shall be  obligated to indemnify the Buyer Parties for the full amount of
such  Indemnifiable Loss relating back to the first dollar of such
Indemnifiable  Loss, subject to the Basket and the Cap described below. Any
Losses that do  not aggregate to the level of an Indemnifiable Loss shall not
be  indemnifiable and shall not count toward satisfaction of the Basket and
Cap  described below. The Company shall not have any liability under
Section  10.2 unless the aggregate of all Indemnifiable Losses for which the
Company  would, but for this sentence, be liable exceeds an amount equal to
$5  million (the "Basket"), in which case the Company shall be obligated to 
indemnify the Buyer   61     Parties for all Indemnifiable Losses
relating back to the first dollar.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company\'s aggregate  liability under Section 10.2 shall in no
event exceed $20 million (the  "Cap").   (b) The amount of any Loss
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 10.2  shall be reduced (i) to the extent
any Buyer Party receives any insurance  proceeds with respect to such Loss,
(ii) to take into account any net Tax  benefit arising from the recognition
of the Loss and (iii) to take into  account any payment actually received by
a Buyer Party with respect to such  Loss.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this  Agreement, the Buyer Parties shall not be
entitled to any indemnification  for any Losses pursuant to Section 10.2 that
resulted from or arose out of  the breach of any representation or warranty
if, as of the date of this  Agreement, or as of the Interim Determination
Date, Corvis had Knowledge of  such breach or the facts and circumstances
underlying such breach.   Section 10.4 Notice of Claim. Any Buyer Party
making a claim for indemnification under Section 10.2 shall notify the
Company of the claim in writing promptly after discovering the liability,
obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, describing
in reasonable detail the claim, the amount thereof and the basis thereof;
provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Company shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that
the Company is actually prejudiced thereby (except that such Notice of Claim
must in any event be delivered not more than sixty (60) days after the
Interim Determination Date).   Section 10.5 Notice and Defense of Third
Party Claims. Any Buyer Party making a claim for indemnification under
Section 10.2 shall notify the Company of the claim in writing promptly after
receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or
other claim against it by a third party describing the claim, the amount
thereof and the basis thereof; provided, however, that the failure to so
notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that the Company is actually prejudiced thereby (except
that such Notice of Claim must in any event be delivered not more than sixty
(60) days after the Interim Determination Date). With respect to any third
party claim, the Company shall be entitled to assume control of the defense
of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise
to a Buyer Party\'s claim for indemnification at and at its option (subject
to the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled to appoint a nationally
recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; provided, however, that   (a) such Buyer Party shall be
entitled to participate in the  defense of such claim and to employ counsel
of its choice for such purpose,  at its sole cost and expense;   (b) the
Company shall not be entitled to assume control of such  defense and shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained  by the Buyer Party
if (i) the claim for indemnification relates to or  arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,  allegation or investigation, or
(ii) upon petition   62     by the Buyer Party, the appropriate court
rules that the Company or the  Stockholder Representative (as applicable)
failed or is failing to  vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; and  
(c) the Company shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer  Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any  settlement of a
claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as  a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable  relief shall be
imposed against the Buyer Party or if such settlement does  not expressly and
unconditionally release the Buyer Party from all  liabilities and obligations
with respect to such claim, without prejudice.   Section 10.6 Manner of
Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any indemnification
of the Buyer Parties pursuant to Section 10.2 shall only be effected either
(x) if finally determined prior to Closing, by deduction from the Net
Purchase Price (as set forth in the definition thereof) for purposes of
determining the number of Merger Shares or the cash payment to be paid as
consideration in accordance with Section 3.2 or (y) finally determined after
the Closing, by payment out of escrow in accordance with Section
3.3(e) hereof. For avoidance of doubt, no Person who is at any time on or
prior to the Closing a stockholder, Affiliate, director, officer, employee,
agent or advisor of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have any personal
liability for indemnification under this Article X and no Buyer Party shall
be entitled to recover any amount therefrom. The Parties will endeavor to
cause any disputes with respect to any Notice of Claim to be resolved as
promptly as possible in accordance with Section 11.7. If all other conditions
to Closing are satisfied other than the resolution of such disputes the
Company shall have the option in accordance with Section 3.3(e) to have a
portion of the Merger Consideration with a value equal to the amount of such
disputes placed in escrow with an escrow agent, and pursuant to an escrow
agreement, mutually acceptable to Corvis and the Company, pending final
resolution of such disputes in accordance with Section 11.7.   Section 10.7
Sole and Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Interim Determination Date, the
indemnification provisions of this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Buyer Parties (i) for any breach of the Company\'s
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or (ii) otherwise with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or any of its Affiliates
may have against the Company Parties hereunder or under Applicable Law with
respect thereto. Without limitation upon the preceding sentence, other than
their right to indemnification pursuant to this Article X, Buyer Parties
waive and release the Company Parties from and against, any and all claims,
demands, causes of action, liabilities, costs or expenses (whether arising
under statutory or common law or at equity) of Buyer Parties with respect to
any environmental, health or safety matters (including without limitation any
rights or remedies, whether for contribution or otherwise, arising under the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act,
as amended from time to time).   Section 10.8 Limitation of Warranties.

Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company and Corvis agree that the recovery by any Buyer Party of any damages
suffered or incurred by such Buyer Party as a result of any breach by the
Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to

IN ALL  RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN
ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE
CONFLICT OF LAW  PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to
the  jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal
courts  of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware
solely in  respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this  Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in 
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and  agree
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the

or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may  not be

in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree  that all

EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE  IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER,
(iii) EACH PARTY   66     MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO  ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND  CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.4.   Section 11.5
Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties; provided, however, that Corvis may assign Sub\'s rights and
obligations, in whole or in part, under this Agreement to Corvis or any other
wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Corvis. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   Section 11.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.   Section 11.7 Remedies; Dispute Resolution.   (a)
Retention of Remedies. In addition to any remedy to which any  party hereto
is specifically entitled by the terms hereof, each party shall  be entitled
to pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity  (including
damages, specific performance or other injunctive relief) in the  event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in  accordance
with their terms or were otherwise breached.   (b) Binding Arbitration. The
Parties agree that the negotiation  and arbitration procedures set forth
below will be the sole and exclusive  remedy for resolving disputes or
disagreements for money damages between  any of the Parties as to the
interpretation of any provision of this  Agreement or of any of the
agreements contemplated hereby, as to the  performance of any obligations
hereunder or thereunder, as to any  determination to be made by any of the
Parties hereunder or thereunder, or  that otherwise arise out of this
Agreement or any of the agreements  contemplated hereby (each, a
"Dispute"):   (i) In the event that any Party or Parties hereto asserts 
that there exists a Dispute, such Party or Parties (the "Asserting  Parties")
will deliver a written notice to the other Party or Parties  involved in such
Dispute (the "Receiving Parties"), specifying the nature  of the asserted
Dispute and requesting a meeting to resolve the same (the  "Dispute Notice").
Upon delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Asserting  Parties and the Receiving
Parties (the "Disputing Parties") will promptly  meet in a good faith effort
to resolve such Dispute. If the Disputing  Parties are unable to resolve such
Dispute   67     through good faith negotiations within 15 calendar days
after delivery of  the Dispute Notice, the Asserting Parties may commence
binding arbitration  hereunder by delivering to the Receiving Parties written
notice of  arbitration (the "Arbitration Notice") within 60 calendar days
after  delivery of the Dispute Notice. Such Arbitration Notice shall specify
the  matters as to which arbitration is sought, the nature of any Dispute,
the  claims of each party to the arbitration and shall specify the amount
and  nature of any damages, if any, sought to be recovered as a result of
any  alleged claim, and any other matters required by the Rules (as defined 
below) to be included therein, if any.   (ii) Upon delivery of the
Arbitration Notice, the Dispute  will be settled exclusively by binding
arbitration in the city of Chicago,  Illinois. Such arbitration will be
administered by the Center for Public  Resources Institute for Dispute
Resolutions (the "Institute") in accordance  with its then-prevailing Rules
for Non-Administered Arbitration of Business  Disputes (the "Rules"), by one
independent and impartial arbitrator jointly  selected by the Asserting
Parties and the Receiving Parties (or, if they  cannot agree, in accordance
with the Rules).   (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided 
herein, the arbitration will be governed by the United States Arbitration 
Act, 9 U.S.C. (S) 1 et seq.   (iv) The fees and expenses of the Institute
and the  arbitrator will be paid equally by the Disputing Parties to the
arbitration  and will be advanced by it from time to time as required;
provided that at  the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator will
award costs and  expenses (including the costs of the arbitration previously
advanced and  the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other
experts) between  the Disputing Parties based on the relative extent to which
each of such  Parties prevails on the merits of the Dispute.   (v) The
arbitrator shall permit and facilitate such limited  discovery as it shall
determine appropriate in the circumstances,  consistent with the
arbitrator\'s purpose of obtaining a swift and efficient  resolution of any
Dispute. The Disputing Parties will keep confidential any  proprietary
information or other non-public information disclosed in any  such
discovery.   (vi) The arbitrator will render its decision and award  within
90 days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary provided herein and without  prejudice to the above
procedures, any Disputing Party may apply to any  court of competent
jurisdiction for temporary injunctive or other  provisional judicial relief
if such action is necessary to avoid  irreparable damage or to preserve the
status quo until such time as the  arbitration panel is convened and
available to hear such Party\'s request  for temporary relief. The award
rendered by the arbitrator will be final  and binding on all of the Disputing
Parties and there will be no appeal  from or reexamination of the final
award, except for fraud, perjury,  evident partiality or misconduct by an
arbitrator prejudicing the rights of  any Party, or to correct manifest
clerical errors. Each of the Disputing  Parties may enforce such final award
and a judgment thereon may be entered  in any court of competent
jurisdiction.   68     Section 11.8 Obligations of Subsidiaries.
Whenever this Agreement requires any Subsidiary of Corvis (including Sub) or
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Corvis or the Company, as the case may
be, to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.   Section 11.9
Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.   Section 11.10 No Strict Construction. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any party.   69     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Corvis, Sub and
the Company have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized all as of the date first written
above.   CORVIS CORPORATION    By: /s/ David R. Huber
