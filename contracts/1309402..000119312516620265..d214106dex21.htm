1.6  _Assumption/Rejection of Certain Contracts_.

(a) _Assignment and Assumption at Closing_.

 

(i) Schedule 1.6(a) sets forth a list of the executory Contracts (including
all leases with respect to Leased Real Property) which Purchaser has
indicated are intended to be Assigned Contracts. Sellers represent and warrant
that the aggregate cure costs for the Assigned Contracts listed on Schedule
1.6(a) as of the date of this Agreement shall not exceed $250,000 ("
_Estimated Cure Costs_ "). From and after the date hereof until the later of:
(i) three (3) Business Days prior to the Auction; or (ii) the entry by the
Bankruptcy Court of an order authorizing the Cure Costs for each of the
Assigned

 



9  Contracts, the Sellers shall make such deletions to Schedule 1.6(a) as
Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, request in writing. Any such deleted
Contract shall be deemed to no longer be an Assigned Contract. All Contracts
of Sellers that are not listed on Schedule 1.6(a) shall not be considered an
Assigned Contract or Purchased Asset and shall be deemed " _Rejected
Contracts_."

 

(ii) Sellers shall take all actions required to assume and assign the Assigned
Contracts to Purchaser, including taking all actions required to facilitate
any negotiations with the counterparties to such Assigned Contracts and to
obtain an Order containing a finding that the proposed assumption and
assignment of the Assigned Contracts to Purchaser satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

(iii) At Closing, (x) Sellers shall, pursuant to the Sale Order and the
Assumption and Assignment Agreement or the Assumption and Assignment of
Leases, as applicable, assume and assign to Purchaser (the consideration for
which is included in the Purchase Price) each of the Assigned Contracts that
is capable of being assumed and assigned, and (y) Sellers shall pay promptly
all Cure Costs (if any) from the Purchase Price at the Closing Date in
connection with such assumption and assignment (as agreed to among the various
counterparties, Purchaser and Sellers, or as determined by the Bankruptcy
Court) and assume and perform and discharge the Assumed Liabilities (if any)
under the Assigned Contracts, pursuant to the Assumption and Assignment
Agreement or the Assumption and Assignment of Leases, as applicable.

(b) _Previously Omitted or Undisclosed Contracts_.

 

(i) If prior to or following Closing, it is discovered that a Contract should
have been listed on _Schedule 1.6(a)_ but was not listed on _Schedule 1.6(a)_
, or if Purchaser desires in its sole discretion to acquire any Contract to
which any of the Sellers are a party (including any Rejected Contract prior to
the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of an order with respect thereto) (any such
Contract, a " _Previously Omitted Contract_ "), Sellers shall, promptly
following the discovery thereof or receipt of notice from Purchaser of its
desire to acquire any such Contract (but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days following the discovery thereof or receipt of such notice),
notify Purchaser in writing of such Previously Omitted Contract and all Cure
Costs (if any) for such Previously Omitted Contract. Purchaser shall
thereafter deliver written notice to Sellers, no later than five (5) Business
Days following notification of such Previously Omitted Contract from Sellers,
designating such Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed" or "Rejected" (a "
_Previously Omitted Contract Designation_ "). A Previously Omitted Contract
designated in accordance with this _Section 1.6(b)(i)_ as "Rejected," or with
respect to which Purchaser fails to timely deliver a Previously Omitted
Contract Designation, shall be a Rejected Contract.

(ii) If Purchaser designates a Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed" in
accordance with _Section 1.6(b)(i)_ , (i) _Schedule 1.6(a)_ shall be amended
to include such Previously Omitted Contract and (ii) Sellers shall serve a
notice (the " _Previously Omitted Contract Notice_ ") on the counterparties
to such Previously Omitted

 



10  Contract notifying such counterparties of the Cure Costs with respect to
such Previously Omitted Contract and Sellers intention to assume and assign
such Previously Omitted Contract in accordance with this _Section 1.6_. The
Previously Omitted Contract Notice shall provide the counterparties to such
Previously Omitted Contract with fifteen (15) Business Days to object, in
writing to the Sellers and Purchaser, to the Cure Costs or the assumption of
its Contract. If the counterparties, Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach
a consensual resolution with respect to the objection, the Sellers will seek
an expedited hearing before Bankruptcy Court to determine the Cure Costs and
approve the assumption. If no objection is timely served on the Sellers and
Purchaser, Sellers shall obtain an order of the Bankruptcy Court fixing the
Cure Costs and approving the assumption of the Previously Omitted Contract. 

1.7 _Disclaimer_. PURCHASER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE
PURCHASED ASSETS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SELLERS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY
WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AS TO ANY PORTION OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS. PURCHASER
FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PURCHASER HAS CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION
AND INVESTIGATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS AND ALL
SUCH OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OR AFFECTING THE PURCHASED ASSETS AS PURCHASER
DEEMED NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE AND THAT IN PROCEEDING WITH ITS ACQUISITION OF
THE PURCHASED ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER IS DOING SO BASED SOLELY UPON SUCH INDEPENDENT
INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS.

ARTICLE II

 

CONSIDERATION

2.1  _Consideration_.

(a) The aggregate consideration (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ ") to
be paid for the purchase of the Purchased Assets, shall be: (i) the
assumption of Assumed Liabilities, plus (ii) $200,000,000 aggregate amount of
cash consideration, plus (iii) Inventory pursuant to the procedures set forth
in Exhibit H, minus (iv) the Cure Cost Reduction, if any; provided, however,
that Purchaser reserves the right to increase the Purchase Price, subject to
the Bidding Procedures Order and applicable Law.

 

(b) Limitation on Purchaser Liability. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
shall have no liability with respect to any costs, fees or expenses of any
nature incurred by the Sellers following the Closing Date.

2.2 _Deposit_. No later than three Business Days following the entry of the
Bidding Procedures Order, Purchaser will make an earnest money deposit (the "
_Deposit_ ") in the amount

 



11  of $20,000,000 to the Escrow Agent. The Deposit shall be applied against
payment of the Purchase Price on the Closing Date. Subject to the termination
provisions set forth in Section 3.5, if this Agreement shall be terminated by
any Party hereto pursuant to _Sections 3.4(a)_; _3.4(b)_ ; _3.4(c)_ ;
_3.4(d)_ ; _3.4(e)_ ; _3.4(f)_ ; _3.4(g)_ ; _3.4(h)_ ; _3.4(j)_ and _3.4(k)_
hereof, then the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser within five (5)
Business Days after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written request therefore.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Sellers pursuant to _Section
3.4(i)_ hereof or otherwise by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under _Section 9.2_ hereof resulting primarily from Purchaser
breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, then
Sellers shall retain the Deposit. The Parties agree that the Sellers right
to retain the Deposit, as set forth herein, is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Sellers for
their efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If the
Closing is not consummated due to Purchasers breach of this Agreement, or if
this Agreement is terminated due to Purchasers breach of this Agreement, then
Sellers shall be entitled, as their sole and exclusive remedy for such breach,
to terminate this Agreement and, retain the Deposit. Sellers hereby waive and
release any right to (and Sellers hereby covenant that they shall not) sue
Purchaser with respect to this Agreement or any Asset contemplated to be
purchased hereunder: (a) for specific performance of this Agreement, or (b)
to recover any damages of any nature or description. Seller and Purchaser
expressly waive and release (i) any right to seek specific performance of
Sellers obligations under this Agreement and (ii) any right to seek or
collect any damages, including any actual, consequential, speculative, remote
or punitive damages.

2.3  _Proration of Certain Transaction Costs_. All relevant rent, taxes
(including real and personal property taxes), utilities and other payments
regarding the Purchased Assets, including the Prepaid Expenses, will be
prorated (based on actual days within the relevant annual, quarterly or
monthly period, as appropriate) between the parties as of midnight of the date
preceding the Closing Date and will be a credit or debit, as the case may be,
against the Purchase Price payable at Closing to the extent thereof.
Purchaser will thereafter be responsible for payment of all such prorated
obligations. The parties shall calculate all prorations and resulting credits,
as the case may be, for real estate taxes pursuant to the common standards of
practice for commercial real estate transactions within the applicable state.
Any amounts not determinable as of the Closing Date or reflected on the
Closing Statement will be taken into account at the Closing based on
good faith estimates. Purchaser will timely make all required notifications
to taxing authorities to effect the change in party responsible for taxes. The
provisions of this Section 2.3 shall survive the Closing.

 

2.4 _Sales Tax_. Sales taxes, if any, resulting from the transfer of the
Purchased Assets, or any particular category thereof, to the extent permitted
by law, will be paid by Purchaser, unless such transfer is subject to an
available exemption therefrom. This Section 2.4 shall survive the Closing.

 

2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price Among Purchased Assets at each Plant_. Prior
to Closing, the parties shall mutually agree as to the specific allocation of
the Purchase Price to the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and such allocation shall be further 

 



12  confirmed by the parties in writing at Closing (the " _Closing Allocation_
"). Each of the parties agrees to report each purchase and sale transaction
hereunder for state and federal tax purposes in a manner consistent with the
Closing Allocation, including the filing of a Form 8594 with the Internal
Revenue Service reflecting such allocation in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.1060 1 and 1.1060 1T. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers
shall take any position (whether in audits, tax returns, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so by applicable law.
If any state or federal taxing authority challenges such
allocation, Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith in responding
to such challenge. Sellers shall give prompt written notice to Purchaser of
any such challenge. Notwithstanding the allocation of the Purchase Price set
forth in the Closing Allocation, nothing in the foregoing shall be
determinative of values ascribed to the Purchased Assets or the allocation of
the value of the Purchased Assets in any plan of reorganization or liquidation
that may be proposed or any structured dismissal order agreement entered into
and the Sellers reserve the right on their behalf and on behalf of the
Sellers estates, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law and
accounting rules, for purposes of any plan of reorganization or liquidation
or structured dismissal, to ascribe values to and allocate the value of the
Purchased Assets.

2.6 _Reductions to Purchase Price_. If the actual Cure Costs (as determined
by an order of the Bankruptcy Court) of the Assigned Contracts set forth on
Section 1.6(a) as of the date of this Agreement exceed the Estimated Cure
Costs (defined above) by more than $100,000 in the aggregate, then the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount (" _Cure Cost Reduction_ ")
equal to the actual Cure Costs _minus_ the Estimated Cure Costs _minus_
$100,000. For the avoidance of doubt, despite as set forth in this section,
Purchaser remains entitled to delete Contracts from _Schedule 1.6(a)_ as
provided in _Section 1.6(a)(_ _i_ _)._ _ _ _For the further avoidance of
doubt, the Estimated Cure Costs and Cure Cost Reduction relate only to
Schedule 1.6(a) as of the date of this Agreement and Purchaser will be
obligated to pay any additional Cure Costs related to any Assumed or Assigned
Contracts which are added after the date of this Agreement._

and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which it is
a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to assume and perform the
Assumed Liabilities. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Purchaser and each of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, the
performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the
assumption and performance of the Assumed Liabilities have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of Purchaser. This

Purchaser is a party when so executed and delivered will constitute, legal,
valid and binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in
accordance with its terms.

 

5.3 _No Inconsistent Obligations_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any other documents contemplated hereby, nor the consummation of

applicable ruling or order of any Governmental Authority, (c) any term or
provision of any contract or agreement, (d) any writ, order, judgment, decree,
law, rule, regulation or ordinance, (e) any other commitment or restriction

a Lien.

 

5.4 _Consents_. Subject to the entry of the Sale Order, except (i) as set

Purchaser of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party,

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
assumption and performance of the Assumed Liabilities or the taking by
Purchaser of any other action contemplated hereby or thereby, other than such
filings, notices or consents, the failure of which to make or obtain would not

perform the Assumed Liabilities or to consummate on a timely basis the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Bankruptcy Case). 

 



30 5.8 _Sufficiency of Funds_. Purchaser has sufficient cash on hand or other
sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the

Date, it has had the opportunity to examine and investigate the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Leased Real Property to the extent permitted by
Sellers. Furthermore, Purchaser shall have the right at all reasonable times,
after giving Sellers advance written notice and at Purchasers sole cost and
expense, of going to the Plants with its agents and engineers as needed to
investigate and inspect the Purchased Assets and to conduct a physical
inventory of the Equipment located at the Plants. In no event shall Sellers be
required to provide any books and records, sales records, trade secrets, and
other proprietary information or materials that are proprietary in nature or
any information or materials that are protected by any privilege, immunity,
work product doctrine or other such protection. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not conduct (or cause to be
conducted) any physically intrusive investigation, examination or study of the
Owned Real Property without obtaining the prior written consent of Sellers.

(b) Purchaser hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless Sellers from and
against any and all damage to the Owned Real Property and the Purchased
Assets (including the cost of restoring the Owned Real Property and the
Purchased Assets to their pre entry condition) and injury to any persons
caused by Purchaser or its agents in the course of exercising Purchasers
investigation under this Agreement. Such indemnification will survive the
expiration or termination of this Agreement and/or the Closing.

 

(c) Purchaser confirms and acknowledges that Sellers have represented that
they have made all title information in its possession available to
Purchaser, and Purchaser (at Purchasers sole expense) may negotiate with the
Title Insurer to obtain Title Policies at Closing.

 

(d) Sellers represent that Sellers have made available to Purchaser for
review, copies of all surveys relating to the Plants and/or Assumed Leased
Real Property which are in their possession or under its control.

(e) AS-IS WHERE-IS SALE; DISCLAIMERS; RELEASE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED
IN ARTICLE IV, IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT, UNLESS EXPRESSLY STATED
HEREIN, SELLERS ARE NOT MAKING AND HAVE NOT AT ANY TIME MADE ANY WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO
THE PURCHASED ASSETS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 



31 (f) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, UPON THE CLOSING, SELLERS SHALL SELL
AND CONVEY TO PURCHASER, AND PURCHASER SHALL ACCEPT, THE PURCHASED ASSETS "AS
IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS." PURCHASER HAS NOT RELIED AND WILL NOT RELY ON,
AND SELLERS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR OR BOUND BY, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, STATEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS OR INFORMATION PERTAINING
TO THE PURCHASED ASSETS OR RELATING THERETO MADE OR FURNISHED BY SELLERS OR
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, TO WHOMEVER MADE OR GIVEN, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
ORALLY OR IN WRITING, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. PURCHASER ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE REFLECTS AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
THAT THE PURCHASED ASSETS ARE BEING SOLD "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS."

(g) PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES TO SELLERS THAT PURCHASER HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO CONDUCT AND DID CONDUCT SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THE
PURCHASED ASSETS AS PURCHASER DEEMS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE TO SATISFY ITSELF

SALE ORDER, PURCHASER WAIVES ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THE VALIDITY AND CONDITION OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS AS OF THE CLOSING.

ARTICLE VI

 

EMPLOYEES

6.1  _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Purchaser intends to extend offers of employment (which may be for
employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) to all of the Sellers
Employees at the Plants related to the Purchased Assets as of the date hereof
who have not been terminated or otherwise left the employ of the Sellers prior
to the Closing Date; provided, however, Purchaser shall retain sole
discretion with respect to the hiring of Plant managers (or similar titles).
In no event shall Purchaser be obligated to commit to

 



32  any particular usage of employees or to any particular benefits or wage
rates. Sellers have made available to Purchaser a correct and complete list of
all their current employees. Consistent with applicable law, the Sellers
shall provide Purchaser access to their personnel records and personnel files,
and shall provide such other information regarding its employees as Purchaser
may reasonably request.  _Schedule 6.1(a)_ sets forth a list of all employees
of Sellers and their Affiliates. All such employees listed on _Schedule
6.1(a)_ who accept such offers of employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates
are hereinafter referred to as the " _Transferred Employees_ " and such
acceptance of offers shall be effective immediately after the Closing.
Effective as of immediately before the Closing, Sellers shall terminate the
employment of its employees who are Transferred Employees. Each Transferred
Employee shall be eligible to participate in all of Purchasers employee
benefit plans in accordance with the terms of those plans, to the same extent
and in the same manner as new employees of Purchaser. 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, participation and benefit accrual
under any Purchaser plans and programs providing employee benefits to
Transferred Employees after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Plans_ "),
each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with Sellers before the Closing Date to the same extent as such Transferred
Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under substantially similar Sellers Employee Benefit Plans in which such
Transferred Employees participated before the Closing Date, except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) For purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental,
hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee,
Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Closing
Plan for such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents (unless
such exclusions or requirements were applicable under comparable Benefit
Plans). In addition, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause any co-
payments, deductible and other eligible expenses incurred by such Transferred
Employee and/or his or her covered dependents under any Benefit Plan
providing, medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits during
the plan year ending on the Closing Date to be credited for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year of each comparable Post-Closing Plan in which he or
she participates.

(d) Purchaser shall assume and honor all vacation days and other paid-time-off
accrued or earned, but not yet taken (provided it does not exceed one years
vacation or PTO accrual), by each Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date,
which shall be delivered by Sellers to Purchaser no later than five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date.

(e) The Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of any severance payment
or benefits that become due to any current or former employee, officer,
director, member, partner or independent contractor as a result of the
termination of such individual by Sellers or ERISA Affiliate thereof. The
Sellers shall be responsible for all 

 



33  legally mandated health care continuation coverage for its, and its
Affiliates, current and former employees (and their qualified beneficiaries)
who had or have a loss of coverage due to a "qualifying event" (within the
meaning of Section 603 of ERISA) which occurred or occurs on or prior to the
Closing Date including, without limitation, any loss of coverage that results
directly or indirectly from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be responsible for any severance
benefits for any Transferred Employee who terminates employment with the
Purchaser or such Affiliate after the Closing Date.

 

(f) On and following the Agreement Date, Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 6.1_ , including exchanging information and data
relating to workers compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan
coverage, and in obtaining any governmental approvals required hereunder,
except as would result in the violation of any applicable Legal Requirement,
including without limitation, any Legal Requirement relating to the
safeguarding of data privacy.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.1_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement only and shall not be construed to grant any
rights, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, to any person who is not a
party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision of this Agreement be deemed
to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that
term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise to limit the right of
Purchaser or the Sellers to amend, modify or terminate any such employee
benefit plan. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be construed to (i)
prohibit any amendments to or termination of any employee benefit plans or
(ii) prohibit the termination or change in terms of employment of any employee
(including any Transferred Employee) as permitted under applicable Law.
Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall confer upon any employee
(including any Transferred Employee) any rights or remedies (including,
without limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period) of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement.

6.2 _Employee Information; Interviews_. On the Agreement Date, or as
reasonably practicable thereafter, Sellers will release to Purchaser a list
of each of Sellers employees employed at each Plant, indicating rate of pay,
number of employees enrolled in Sellers health and welfare benefit plan,
position title and hire or re hire date as shown in Sellers books and
records (provided no representation is made as to the accuracy or completeness
of such information), and will permit Purchaser, at reasonable times during
normal business hours after forty eight (48) hours prior notice and with
minimum impact on Sellers business, to arrange for personal interviews with
Plant managers and other Plant employees (" _Plant Employees_ "), at times and
places mutually agreeable to Sellers and Purchaser, and to arrange for those
relevant employees of Sellers, who are interested, to interview with
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.2 shall
obligate Sellers to provide Purchaser information otherwise protected by the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Notwithstanding
and in limitation of the foregoing, any and all contact and interviews by and
between Purchaser and Plant Employees may only occur within the
Designation Period, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.

 



34 6.3 _No Obligation of Purchaser as to Employees_. Sellers will have the sole
and absolute responsibility for any financial or other commitments to their
employees including, without limitation, any and all claims or obligations for
severance pay and any and all claims and obligations arising under any
collective bargaining agreement, employee benefit plan (including, without
limitation, any withdrawal liability) or any local, state or federal law, rule
or regulation (including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act). Other than as set forth in Section 6.1(a),
Purchaser shall have no contractual or other obligation with respect to
hiring, offering to hire or employing any of Sellers employees. In no event
shall Purchaser be obligated to commit to any particular usage of employees
or to any particular benefits or wage rates. Nothing contained herein shall
be deemed an admission that Sellers has any financial obligation to employees
or that obligations, if any, are entitled to a particular treatment or
priority under the Bankruptcy Code. Sellers failure to pay an obligation, if
any, under this Section 6.3 shall not be a default under this Agreement.

 

6.4 _Termination_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date, except as
provided for or required by a collective bargaining agreement, Sellers will
not and will cause their Affiliates to not transfer, without written consent
of Purchaser, any Plant Employees of such Plant or Plants prior to Purchaser
having completed interviewing such Plant Employees, and having
provided Sellers a list of Plant Employees that Purchaser has chosen not to
hire on the Closing Date, which Purchaser covenants to do as soon as
reasonably practicable.

 

(b) Furthermore, Sellers shall not enter into any agreements or other
arrangements with Plant Employees that will preclude or create a disincentive
to Plant Employees from being employed by Purchaser.

(c) Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended to confer upon any Plant
Employee or his or her legal representatives any rights or remedies of any
nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including
without limitation, any rights of employment for a specified time period.
Purchaser shall not have any liability with respect to claims of Plant
Employees arising from Sellers conduct prior to or as of the Closing. Sellers
shall have no liability with respect to claims of Plant Employees hired
by Purchaser arising from Purchasers conduct after the Closing. Sellers will
proceed diligently and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the entry
of the Sale Order as to the Plants in a form acceptable to Purchaser.

 

ARTICLE VII

BANKRUPTCY COURT MATTERS

7.1 _Approval of Bid Protections and Overbid Protection_. Subject to the entry
of the Bidding Procedures Order, in consideration for Purchaser having
expended considerable time and expense in connection with this Agreement and
the negotiation hereof and the identification and quantification of assets of
Sellers, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser promptly, upon the effective date of
termination of this Agreement or the entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court
approving

 



35  any Alternative Transaction, the applicable Expense Reimbursement and the
payment of a break-up fee of $2,500,000 per Plant (calculated solely by
reference to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ (the " _Break-Up Fee_ ", together with the
applicable Expense Reimbursement, the " _Bid Protections_ "). In addition, the
Bidding Procedures Order shall provide for an initial overbid protection in
the amount of $1,000,000 per Plant over and above the aggregate of the
applicable Purchase Price and the Bid Protections, and minimum bid increments
thereafter of $250,000 per Plant (the " _Overbid Protection_ "). The
obligations of the Sellers to pay the Bid Protections (i) shall be entitled
to administrative expense claim status under Sections 503(b)(1)(A) and
507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) shall not be subordinate to any other
administrative expense claim against the Sellers, other than any adequate
protection order in existence at the time the Bid Protections are approved,
and (iii) shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 3.6_. The Bidding Procedures Order shall approve the Bid
Protections as set forth in this paragraph.

7.2 _Competing Bid and Other Matters_.

 

(a) Within seven days of the Agreement Date Sellers shall file with the
Bankruptcy Court an application or motion seeking approval of (i) the Bidding
Procedures Order and (ii) the form of this Agreement (a true and complete copy
of which shall be attached to such application or motion without schedules)
and the Sellers authority to enter into this Agreement (the " _Sale and
Bidding Procedures Motion_ ").

(b) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to
Sellers absolute right and ability to consider higher or better competing
bids with respect to the Business and a material portion of the Purchased
Assets pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order (each a " _Competing Bid_ ").
Following completion of the Auction, if Purchaser is the Prevailing Bidder,
Sellers shall not initiate contact with, solicit or encourage submission of
any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person other than Purchaser
in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Purchased Assets. In
addition, unless otherwise directed by the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers shall not
after completion of the Auction respond to or pursue any proposed Alternative
Transaction or perform any other acts related thereto.

(c) If an Auction is conducted, and Purchaser is not the prevailing party at
the conclusion of such Auction (such prevailing party, the " _Prevailing
Bidder_ ") and unless otherwise terminated pursuant to _Section 3.4_ ,
Purchaser shall, if its bid is determined to be the next highest bid, serve as
a back-up bidder (the " _Back-up Bidder_ ") and keep Purchasers bid to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon
in the Auction) open and irrevocable until the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m.
(prevailing Eastern time) on the date which is 14 days after the date of the
Sale Hearing (the " _Outside Back-up Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Outside Back-up Date be
later than September 30, 2016 or (ii) the date of closing of an Alternative
Transaction with the Prevailing Bidder. Following the Sale Hearing and prior
to the Outside Back-up Date, if the Prevailing Bidder fails to consummate the
applicable Alternative Transaction as a result of a breach or failure to
perform on the part of such Prevailing Bidder, the Back-up Bidder will be
deemed to 

 



36  have the new prevailing bid, and Sellers will be authorized, without further
order of the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as
the same may be improved upon in the Auction) with the Back-up Bidder.

(d) The Sellers shall promptly serve true and correct copies of the Sale and
Bidding Procedures Motion and all related pleadings in accordance with the
Bidding Procedures Order, the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure, the Local Rules for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Eastern District of Missouri and any other applicable order of the Bankruptcy
Court.

7.3  _Sale Order_. The Sale Order shall be entered by the Bankruptcy Court.
The Sale Order shall, among other things, (i) approve, pursuant to Sections
105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, (A) the execution, delivery and
performance by Sellers of this Agreement, (B) the sale of the Purchased
Assets to Purchaser on the terms set forth herein and free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Encumbrances included in the Assumed Liabilities and
Permitted Encumbrances), and (C) the performance by Sellers of their
obligations under this Agreement; (ii) authorize and empower Sellers to assume
and assign to Purchaser the Assigned Contracts; and (iii) find that Purchaser
is a "good faith" buyer within the meaning of Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code, not a successor to Sellers and grant Purchaser the
protections of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. Purchaser agrees that it
will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by Sellers to
assist in obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval of the Sale Order, including
furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for purposes, among others, of (a) demonstrating that
Purchaser is a "good faith" purchaser under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code, and (b) establishing adequate assurance of future performance within the
meaning of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

7.4 _Contracts_. Sellers shall serve on all non-Seller counterparties to all
of their Contracts a notice specifically stating that Sellers are or may be
seeking the assumption and assignment of such Contracts and shall notify such
non-Seller counterparties of the deadline for objecting to the Cure Costs, if
any, which deadline shall not be less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Sale Hearing.

7.5 _Bankruptcy Filings_. From and after the Agreement Date and until the
Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser drafts of any and all

the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate with each
other in any lawful and feasible arrangement designed to provide Purchaser

such Party within that twenty (20) day period, to take possession of the
records within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice.

 

8.10 _Publicity_. Neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall issue any press release
or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,

otherwise required by applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect
to filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this

damaged, or if condemnation proceedings are commenced against any material
part of the relevant Owned Real Property or Assumed Leased Real Property,
Purchaser will have the right, within five (5) Business Days after receiving
written notice of such damage, destruction or condemnation proceedings, to
terminate this Agreement as to the Purchased Assets affected by such loss, and
thereafter none of the parties will have any further rights or obligations
hereunder as to such Purchased Assets; provided, however, that this Agreement
will be a continuing obligation of the parties as to the Purchased Assets not
affected by such termination. If Purchaser does not exercise its right of
termination with respect to the Purchased Assets affected by such casualty or
proceeding and the Purchased Assets are sold to Purchaser pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, as Purchasers sole remedies, Sellers will assign to

shall not be liable for any obligation, interest, Claim, Liabilities or
Encumbrances (other than Assumed Liabilities and Permitted Encumbrances)
against Sellers or any of Sellers

 



44  predecessors or Affiliates, and Purchaser shall have no successor or
vicarious liability of any kind or character whether known or unknown as of
the Closing Date, whether now existing or hereafter arising, or whether fixed
or contingent, with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets or any
Liabilities of Sellers arising prior to the Closing Date. The Parties agree

filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary in connection therewith.
Sellers and Purchaser will each pay one-half of any fees payable in connection
with such filing.

 

8.17 _Estoppel_ _Certificates_. Sellers will use reasonable commercial efforts
to cooperate with Purchaser in obtaining from each of the Landlords on
Assumed Leased Real Property an estoppel certificate substantially in the form
of Exhibit I to this Agreement or in such substantively similar form as may be
provided for under the particular Lease for the Assumed Leased Real Property

events or conditions arising after the date hereof and prior to the Closing,

appropriate to correct any inaccuracy in a representation made by such Party,
to add a schedule to the Schedules with a corresponding reference in this
Agreement (such information and additional schedules collectively being called

the Sellers of any such removal promptly after making such determination, but
in any event, at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing Date.

 

8.19 Purchaser shall be authorized to use Sellers utility accounts with
respect to the Purchased Assets pending Purchasers obtaining utility
accounts in its own name, provided that if Purchaser has not obtained utility
accounts in its own name on or before fourteen (14) days after the Closing
Date, Sellers shall be entitled to take any action to shut off any
such utilities, and shall be entitled to seek a return of any bond securing
any such utilities. Nothing in this subsection shall effect or alter the
