Well, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Properties when they pass through the delivery point
sales meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines
through which they are transported. Seller shall use reasonable
interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact
meter readings or gauging or strapping data are not available.

(b) Surface use or damage fees, insurance premiums (and refunds thereof), and
other Property Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the
number of days in the applicable period falling before, or on or after, the
Effective Date.

audits of Property Costs covering periods for which Seller is in whole or in
part responsible under Section 2.4, provided that Purchaser shall not agree to
any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Seller is liable, or
any compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would be entitled,
without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of all
applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by Purchaser
and relating to periods for which Seller is partially responsible.

be interpreted in accordance with accounting recognition guidance under the
Accounting Principles.

(e) Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to balance in kind with
respect to any imbalances existing as of Closing or turn over physical
inventories of Hydrocarbons that have been sold prior to Closing, it being
understood and agreed that Purchasers rights with respect to any such Assets
shall be satisfied pursuant to Section 2.3 and Section 2.4.

 



-13- ARTICLE 3

 

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

3.1 _Purchaser_ __ _s Title Review_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date, and pursuant and subject to the terms
of Sections 6.1 and 6.5, Purchaser shall have the right to conduct a review
of Sellers title to the Assets. The provisions of this Article 3, the special
warranty of title in the Assignment and Bill of Sale, and the condition to
closing in Section 7.2(d) provide Purchasers exclusive remedy with
respect to any Title Defects or other deficiencies or defects in Sellers
title to the Properties.

(b) Purchasers rights with respect to title to the Properties pursuant to
this Article 3 are limited to the Properties shown on _Exhibit A_ _-1_ ,
_Exhibit A_ _-2_ , and _Exhibit A_ _-5,_ and Seller hereby expressly
disclaims and negates any and all warranties of title whatsoever, whether
express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, except for the special warranty of
title in the Assignment and Bill of Sale.

(c) The Assignment and Bill of Sale to be executed and delivered by the
Parties at Closing (the " _Assignment and Bill of Sale_ ") shall be in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ _-1_ , and shall contain a special
warranty of Defensible Title to the Properties shown on _Exhibit A_ _-1_ ,
_Exhibit A_ _-2_ , and _Exhibit A_ _-5_ by, through or under Seller, but not
otherwise, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances. Purchaser shall be deemed
to have waived all breaches of Sellers special warranty of title set forth in
the Assignment and Bill of Sale for which Purchaser has not furnished to
Seller a valid defect claim notice that satisfies the requirements set forth
in Section 3.6(a)(i) through (v) on or before the date twenty-four (24) months
after Closing. Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under Sellers
special warranty of title in the Assignment and Bill of Sale against any
Title Defect (i) reported by Purchaser to Seller in a Title Defect notice
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.6(a) prior to the Defect Claim
Date or (ii) for which Purchaser had actual knowledge of but did not submit a
Title Defect notice to Seller regarding the same. If Purchaser provides
written notice of a breach of the special warranty to Seller, Seller shall
have a reasonable opportunity to cure such breach. In any event, the recovery
on a breach of Sellers special warranty under any Assignment and Bill of Sale
(excluding any recovery attributable to such breaches that result from
security interests, deeds of trust, mortgages, pledges or similar interests
granted by Seller) shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset.

3.2 _Definition of Defensible Title_.

 

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means that
title of Seller in the Properties which, as of the Closing Date and subject
to the Permitted Encumbrances:

(i) with respect to each Well set forth on _Exhibit A_ _-2_ , entitles Seller
to not less than the Net Revenue Interest set forth in _Exhibit A_ _-2_ for
such Well throughout the productive life thereof, except (A) decreases in
connection with those operations in which Seller may elect after the date
hereof, in compliance with this Agreement, to be a non-consenting co-owner,
(B) decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after the date
hereof, of pools or units, (C) decreases required to allow other Working
Interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to make up past
under deliveries, and (D) as stated in _Exhibit A_ _-2_ ;

 

(ii) with respect to each Well set forth on _Exhibit A_ _-2_ , obligates
Seller to bear a Working Interest for such Well that is not greater than the

throughout the productive life of such Well, except (A) as stated in _Exhibit
A_ _-2_ and (B) increases resulting from contribution requirements with
respect to defaulting or non-consenting co-owners under applicable operating
agreements or applicable Law and increases that are accompanied by at least a
proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue Interest for such Well;

which Seller may elect after the date hereof to be a non-consenting co-owner,
(B) decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after the date
hereof, pools or units, (C) decreases required to allow other Working

than Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Defect_ " means any lien,
charge, encumbrance, obligation, or defect, including a discrepancy in Net

to be less than Defensible Title. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Title Benefit_ " means any right, circumstance, or condition that operates to

shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit A_

shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_ _-1_ ,  _Exhibit A_ _-2_ , or _Exhibit
A_ _-5_ , as applicable, (ii) increase the Net Acre ownership of Seller in any
Lease above that shown for such Lease on _Exhibit A_ _-_ 1 or _Exhibit A_ _-5

shown for such Lease on  _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , as
applicable, or (iii) decrease the Working Interest of Seller in any Well below
that shown for such Well on _Exhibit A_ _-2_ without causing a proportionate
or greater than proportionate decrease in Sellers Net Revenue Interest in
such Well.

term " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " means any or all of the following:

(a) lessors royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary interests,
back-in interests, and other burdens to the extent that they do not,
individually or in the aggregate, reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interest or Net
Acre ownership in any Property below that shown in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ ,
_Exhibit A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ for such Property or increase Sellers
Working Interest in any Property above that shown in _Exhibit A_ _-2_ for

Revenue Interest or Net Acre ownership in any Property below that shown in
_Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ for such Property or
increase Sellers Working Interest in any Property above that shown in

with the American Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) Standard
Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment Process (Publication Designation: E1527-13) (" _Phase I_ "). Seller

shall have no liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain such operators
permission, and Seller shall not be required to make any payments or
undertake any obligations for the benefit of any other Person with respect to
such access. Seller shall have the right to have one or more representatives
accompany Purchaser and the Environmental Consultant at all times during the
Environmental Review. The Environmental Review shall not include any sampling,
boring, operation of Equipment, or other invasive activity without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent can be withheld in Sellers sole
discretion, and that of any applicable third Person operator. In the event
that (x) Purchaser, in its reasonable discretion based on the findings of
Purchasers Environmental Review, determines that an 

 



-18-  invasive test or procedure is needed with respect to Property and Purchaser
requests in writing (which written notice shall be accompanied by any
correspondence, reports or results regarding the finding on which the request
is based and which Property is impacted by such finding) and does not obtain
the written consent of Seller or an applicable third Person operator for such
invasive test or procedure or (y) Purchaser is not granted access to a
Property for the purpose of conducting its Environmental Review after
notifying Seller in writing of such denial (if an applicable third Person
operator has denied such access), Purchaser may, in its sole discretion
exclude the affected Property and, (i) the affected Property shall not be
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such Property, (iii) such
Property shall be deemed to be deleted from _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_
_-2_ and/or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ attached hereto and added to  _Schedule 1.3_
attached hereto and (iv) such Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder. In performing its Environmental Review, Purchaser
shall (and shall cause the Environmental Consultant and Purchasers other
representatives to): (1) perform all work in a safe and workmanlike manner;
(2) perform all work in such a way as to not unnecessarily and unreasonably
interfere with the operation of any Property or the business of Seller; (3)
materially comply with all applicable Laws; and (4) at its sole cost, risk,
and expense, with respect to any physical damages caused by the Environmental
Review, restore the Properties to their condition prior to the commencement
of the Environmental Review.

(b) Purchaser shall provide to Seller (free of cost) copies (electronic or
paper at Purchasers option) of any environmental reports and results
(including any interim, draft or preliminary reports or results) generated by
the Environmental Consultant to Seller promptly after request by Seller, such
materials provided without any representation or warranty or any right of
Seller to rely upon such materials, and the Seller hereby releases any claim
it may have against Purchaser or the Environmental Consultant related to
Sellers reliance on such materials or Sellers use thereof. Except (i) as
may be required or permitted pursuant to the exercise of the rights and
fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under this Agreement, (ii) as may be
required by applicable Law (including as may be required by
deposition, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal
or regulatory proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other
similar process or law), or (iii) for information which is or becomes public
knowledge through no fault of the Person against whom this sentence is sought
to be enforced, Purchaser and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall
maintain, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees,
contractors, consultants (including the Environmental Consultant), and other
advisors to maintain, all information, reports (whether interim, draft, final,
or otherwise), data, work product, and other matters obtained or generated
from or attributable to the Environmental Review (the " _Environmental
Information_ ") strictly confidential, and shall not disclose all or any
portion of the Environmental Information to any third Person without the
consent of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the Environmental
Information to Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole
property of Seller. Each Party shall be responsible for the compliance of its
Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
contractors, consultants (including the Environmental Consultant), and other
advisors with the immediately preceding sentence.

produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on, or
under the Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain hazardous materials, including asbestos
and naturally occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "). NORM may affix or
attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in
other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or
included in the Assets may contain hazardous materials, including asbestos and
NORM. Hazardous materials, including asbestos and NORM, may have come into

disclaims any, representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to
the presence or absence of NORM, asbestos, mercury, drilling fluids and
chemicals, and produced waters and Hydrocarbons in or on the Properties or
Equipment.

3.5  _Environmental Defects_. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Environmental Defect_ " means any condition, matter, obligation, or
circumstance with respect to any given Asset that constitutes, or arises from,
a breach of Environmental Law or that is soil, water, or groundwater
contamination in excess of standards permitted under Environmental Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Environmental Defect" shall not
include (i) current obligations to plug or abandon any well, (ii) NORM that

matters that are disclosed on _Schedule 3.5_.

 

3.6 _Notice of Title and Environmental Defects and Benefits; Adjustment_.

 

(a) To assert a claim arising out of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver a
defect claim notice or notices to Seller on or before January 27, 2017 at

information upon which Purchasers estimate is based.

WITHOUT LIMITATION OF PURCHASERS RIGHTS PURSUANT TO THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF

WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND
ALL TITLE DEFECTS OR OTHER DEFICIENCIES OR DEFECTS IN SELLERS TITLE TO THE
PROPERTIES (AND ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE ATTRIBUTABLE
THERETO) FOR WHICH SELLER HAS NOT RECEIVED, ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT CLAIM
DATE, A VALID TITLE DEFECT CLAIM NOTICE THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS
AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3.6(A).

(b) Should either Party discover any Title Benefit on or before the Defect

information upon which such Partys estimate is based.

 

SELLER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT
SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL TITLE BENEFITS OF WHICH NO PARTY
HAS RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT CLAIM DATE A VALID BENEFIT CLAIM NOTICE
THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS
SECTION 3.6(B), EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PURCHASER HAS FAILED TO GIVE A NOTICE

WITHOUT LIMITATION OF PURCHASERS RIGHTS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11.3(B)(III)
WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 4.15 AND SECTION 11.3(B)(I) WITH RESPECT TO
SECTION 11.2(G), PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND
COVENANTS THAT IT SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS
AND OTHER DEFECTS OR DAMAGES RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE

THERETO) FOR WHICH SELLER HAS NOT RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE DEFECT CLAIM DATE
A VALID ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT CLAIM NOTICE THAT SATISFIES ALL OF THE CONDITIONS
AND REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3.6(C).

(d) Purchaser agrees to provide written notification to Seller of any Title
Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects discovered by Purchaser, as
soon as reasonably practicable after discovery thereof. Such written
notification shall be preliminary and general in nature and need not conform
to the notice provisions set forth in Sections 3.6(a), 3.6(b) and 3.6(c);
provided, however, the Parties shall be obligated, upon notification from
Seller, to discuss any matter set forth in any such written notification
delivered hereunder. Further, Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller in
reviewing and commenting on any curative materials provided by Seller (or
Sellers representatives) to Purchaser with

 



-21-  respect to potential Title Defects and Environmental Defects of which Seller
is made aware of prior to Closing. Failure to comply with this Section 3.6(d)
shall not be deemed a waiver of any of Purchasers rights hereunder with
respect to such Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects.

3.7 _Cure; Removal_.

(a) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, risk, and expense, to cure or remove, on or before ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date (the " _Cure Date_ "), any alleged Title
Defects or Environmental Defects of which Seller has been advised by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(c). To exercise such cure right Seller
shall provide written notice to Purchaser of its intent to attempt to cure
such alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects on or before 5:00 p.m.
local time in Houston, Texas on the date that is at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any Title Defect or
Environmental Defect that Seller elects to cure pursuant to this Section
3.7(a), the Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts with respect
to such Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall be addressed as provided
in Section 3.8(e) for purposes of Closing and thereafter any adjustment
required under Section 3.8(a) with respect thereto shall be made pursuant to
Section 3.8(f). The election by Seller to attempt to cure one or more of such
alleged Title Defects or Environmental Defects shall not affect the rights and
obligations of the Parties under Section 3.10 with respect to dispute
resolution. Sellers election to attempt cure an alleged Title Defect or
Environmental Defect shall not constitute a waiver of any of the rights of
Seller pursuant to this Article 3, including Sellers right to dispute the
existence, nature, or value of such Title Defect or Environmental Defect.

(b) With respect to any Title Defect or Environmental Defect which Seller has
elected to attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a) above, subject to the
determination by the Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator, as
applicable, of the existence or Title Defect Amount or Environmental Defect
Amount with respect to such a Title Defect or Environmental Defect, to the
extent any such Title Defect or Environmental Defect is cured by Seller on or
before the Cure Date, the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted
Purchase Price for such Title Defect or Environmental Defect shall
be addressed as provided in Section 3.8(f).

(c) Any dispute relating to whether and to what extent a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect has been cured shall be deemed to be a Disputed Matter
and shall be resolved as set forth in Section 3.10, except that any such
matter shall be submitted to the Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator,
as applicable, on or before ten (10) Business Days after the Cure Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any prior or concurrent determination by a Title
Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator with respect to Title Defects or
Environmental Defects (or factual or legal matters relating thereto, even if
determined in connection with the resolution of an otherwise unrelated
dispute) which Seller has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to Section
3.7(a) shall be binding on the Parties with respect to such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect (or factual or legal matters relating thereto, even if
determined in connection with the resolution of an otherwise unrelated
dispute).

 

(d) Seller, with respect to part (i) of this paragraph (d), and Seller and
Purchaser with respect to part (ii) of this paragraph (d), shall have the
right to exclude an Asset from this Agreement if (i) Purchasers estimate of a
Title Defect Amount, as set forth in a notice delivered in accordance with
3.6(a) or (ii) Purchasers Environmental Consultants estimate of the
Environmental Defect Amount, as set forth in a notice delivered in accordance
with 3.6(c), in each case, exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value
of the Asset(s) affected thereby, in which case, (A) the affected Asset shall
not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such Asset, (C) such
Asset shall be deemed to be deleted from _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_
and/or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ attached hereto and added to _Schedule 1.3_ attached
hereto and (D) such Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes
hereunder

 



-22- 3.8 _Adjustment for Title Defects and Benefits and Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) With respect to each Property affected by Title Defects or Environmental
Defects reported under Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(c), such Property shall be
assigned at Closing subject to all uncured Title Defects and Environmental
Defects, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by (i) in the case of Title
Defects, an amount determined pursuant to Section 3.9(a) (the " _Title
Defect Amount_ "), and (ii) in the case of an Environmental Defect, an amount
determined pursuant to Section 3.9(c) (the " _Environmental Defect Amount_ "),
in each case as provided in Sections 3.8(d), 3.8(e) and 3.8(f),
as applicable.

(b) With respect to each Property affected by Title Benefits reported under
Section 3.6(b), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased for each
Title Benefit by an amount as determined pursuant to Section 3.9(b) (the "
_Title Benefit Amount_ "), in each case as provided in Sections 3.8(d), 3.8(e)
and 3.8(f), as applicable.

 

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree upon all the existence of any
Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects reported pursuant to
Sections 3.6(a), 3.6(b) and 3.6(c) above, as applicable, and any corresponding
Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and Environmental Defect Amounts
on or before the Closing Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree
by the Closing Date, then, subject to Section 3.7, the Title Defects, Title
Benefits, Environmental Defects, reported pursuant to Sections 3.6(a), 3.6(b)
and 3.6(c), as applicable, and any corresponding Title Defect Amounts, Title
Benefit Amounts, and Environmental Defect Amounts which are then in dispute
(each a " _Disputed Matter_ ") shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to Section 3.10(a) with respect to Disputed Matters
concerning Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and/or Title
Benefit Amounts, and Section 3.10(b) with respect to Disputed Matters
concerning Environmental Defects and/or Environmental Defect Amounts.

 

(d) At Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted (i) in
accordance with Section 3.8(a) with respect to any Title Defects and
Environmental Defects which (A) Seller has not elected to attempt to cure
pursuant to Section 3.7(a) and (B) which are not Disputed Matters and (ii) in
accordance with Section 3.8(b) with respect to any Title Benefits which
are not Disputed Matters.

(e) At Closing, an amount equal to the sum of all Title Defect Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts (as asserted in good faith by Purchaser in the
applicable Title Defect notices and Environmental Defect notices in accordance
with Sections 3.6(a) and 3.6(c)) related to (i) any Title Defects and
Environmental Defects which Seller elects to attempt to cure pursuant to
Section 3.7(a) or (ii) which are Disputed Matters (such aggregate amount, the
" _Defect Escrow Amount_ "), shall be deducted in the calculation of the
Closing Payment, as provided in Section 8.4(a); and at the Closing, Purchaser
shall deposit the Defect Escrow Amount into an escrow account established with
Escrow Agent (the " _Defect Escrow Account_ "). The Defect Escrow Amount shall
be held, invested and disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Article
3 and the Escrow Agreement pending the curing or resolution of the applicable
Title Defects and Environmental Defects. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Defect Escrow Account shall be independent of and separate from the Escrow
Account established for the Deposit and the Indemnity Escrow.

 



-23- (f) After Closing the Purchase Price shall be adjusted for (i) any Title
Defects and Environmental Defects which (A) Seller elects to attempt to cure
pursuant to Section 3.7(a) and actually cures or (B) which are Disputed
Matters and (ii) any Title Benefits which are Disputed Matters as provided in
this Section 3.8(f). Within ten (10) Business Days after the determination of
all Disputed Matters submitted to a Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator pursuant to Section 3.10(a) and Section 3.10(b), as applicable, the
Parties shall, after giving effect to the limitations provided in Section
3.9, execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing it to
pay (i) to Purchaser, the sum of the Title Defect Amounts and Environmental
Defect Amounts associated with (A) those Title Defects and Environmental
Defects which Seller elected to attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a)
which are not Disputed Matters and which are not fully cured as provided in
Section 3.7 (provided however, if curative efforts by Seller mitigated an
uncured Title Defect or Environmental Defect, the Title Defect Amount or
Environmental Defect Amount associated with such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect shall be revised pursuant to Section 3.9(a) or Section 3.9(c), as
applicable) and (B) any Disputed Matters, determined in favor of Purchaser by
the applicable Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator under Section
3.10(a) or Section 3.10(b), less any offsetting Title Benefits which are
Disputed Matters and are determined in favor of Seller by the Title
Arbitrator under Section 3.10(a) and (ii) to Seller, the remainder of Defect
Escrow Amount. The Parties shall treat for Tax purposes, any amounts paid
pursuant to this Section 3.8(f) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and
any payment made pursuant to this Section 3.8(f) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts to be
designated in writing by the Party receiving such payment. Any post-Closing
payment pursuant to this Section 3.8(f) shall bear interest from the Closing
Date to the date of payment at the Agreed Rate (without duplication of
interest at the Agreed Rate paid under any other provision of this Agreement).

 

(g) EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.15, SECTION 11.3(B)(I) WITH RESPECT TO
SECTION 11.2(G), THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE ASSIGNMENT AND BILL OF
SALE, AND THE CONDITION TO CLOSING IN SECTION 7.2(D), THIS SECTION 3.8 SHALL,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND
REMEDY OF PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO TITLE DEFECTS AND OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN
TITLE TO THE ASSETS AND ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS AND OTHER DEFECTS OR
DAMAGES RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES. IN THIS
REGARD AND WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, IF PURCHASER, AS OF
THE DEFECT CLAIM DATE, HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT A TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER DEFICIENCY
IN TITLE TO THE ASSETS OR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT OR OTHER DEFECT OR DAMAGE
RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES WHICH RESULTS FROM
ANY MATTER WHICH COULD ALSO RESULT IN THE BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF SELLER AS SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 4 OF THE AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN
SECTION 4.15), THEN PURCHASER SHALL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO ASSERT SUCH MATTER
PRIOR TO THE DEFECT CLAIM DATE AS A TITLE DEFECT OR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT, AS
APPLICABLE, IN EACH CASE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THIS ARTICLE 3 AND SHALL
BE PRECLUDED FROM ALSO ASSERTING SUCH MATTER AS THE BASIS OF THE BREACH OF ANY
SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY. FURTHER, WITHOUT LIMITING THE PRECEDING
SENTENCES, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 3.6(A) AND SECTION 3.6(C), PURCHASER
RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, INTEREST OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL
SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES,
COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN
EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE,
BASED ON, RELATING TO, OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT, ENVIRONMENTAL
DEFECT, OR OTHER DEFICIENCY IN TITLE TO, OR OTHER DEFECTS OR DAMAGES RELATED
TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF, ANY ASSET.

 



-24- 3.9 _Calculation of Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts, and
Environmental Defect Amounts_.

(a) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree in writing upon the Title Defect Amount,
that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance, or other charge which is
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to un conditionally remove the Title Defect from Sellers
interest in the affected Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers
aggregate ownership of Net Acres for any Lease and (B) the amount of Net Acres
set forth for such Lease in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ then the
Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between
the number of Net Acres owned by Seller in such Lease and the number of Net
Acres set forth for such Lease in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , as
applicable, and the denominator of which is the Net Acres set forth for such
Lease in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , as applicable;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Sellers
Net Revenue Interest for any Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ or  _Exhibit A_ _-5_ for such
Property, and for which there is not any change in the Sellers Working
Interest or Net Acre ownership for such Property from that set forth in
_Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , as applicable, for
such Property, as applicable, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the decrease in Sellers Net Revenue Interest and the
denominator of which is Sellers Net Revenue Interest stated on  _Exhibit A_
_-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ for such Property; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the Title Defect does not affect the Property throughout
its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this
Section 3.9(a)(iv) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time
period only;

 

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or
charge upon, or other defect in title to, the affected Property of a type not
described in subsections (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Property so affected, the portion of Sellers interest in the
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the
productive life of the affected Property, the values placed upon the Title
Defect by Purchaser and Seller, the age of the factual matters causing or
constituting the alleged Title Defect, the probability that title failure will
occur with respect to any Title Defect that represents only a possibility of
title failure, and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

(vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title
Defect Amount shall be no greater than the reasonable cost and expense of
curing such Title Defect;

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit
in the calculation of the Purchase Price; and

 



-25- (viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

 

(A) an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a valid claim notice is
given prior to the Defect Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with
respect thereto exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000);

 

(B) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all
Title Defects upon any given Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Property; and

(C) there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Defects
unless and until the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts which would
generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.9(a)(viii)(A) exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price, and then only to the extent that such aggregate amount
exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

(b) The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be
determined as follows:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree in writing upon the Title Benefit Amount,
that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers
aggregate Net Acre ownership in any Lease and (B) amount of Net Acres shown
for such Lease in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , then the Title
Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is difference between the
number of Net Acres owned by Seller in such Lease and the number of Net Acres
set forth for such Lease in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , as
applicable, and the denominator of which is the Net Acres set forth for such
Lease in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ , as applicable;

 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
with respect to such Property in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ or
_Exhibit A_ _-5_ , the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_
_-2_ or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ with respect to such Property; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Title Benefit does not affect a Property throughout
the entire productive life of the Property, the Title Benefit Amount
determined under this Section 3.9(b)(iii) shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

(iv) if a Title Benefit represents a right, circumstance, or condition of a
type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Benefit
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Property so affected, the portion of Sellers interest in the Property so
affected, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential discounted
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the productive life of any affected
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Seller,
and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, an individual
claim for a Title Benefit shall only generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price if the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto exceeds One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000); and

 



-26- (vi) there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Benefits
unless and until the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts which would
generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.9(b)(v) exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price, and then only to the extent that such aggregate amount
exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

(c) The Environmental Defect Amount resulting from an Environmental Defect
shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

 

(ii) the Environmental Defect Amount shall include but shall not exceed the
reasonable cost of the response required under Environmental Laws that
addresses the applicable Environmental Defect applying Environmental Laws as
of the Defect Claim Date in the most cost effective manner reasonably
available and commercially reasonable and practical (considered as a whole
taking into consideration any material negative impact such response may have
on the operations of the relevant Assets (as currently operated) and any
potential material additional costs or liabilities that may likely arise as a
result of such response);

 

(iii) the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Environmental Defect Amount or adjustment to the Purchase Price
hereunder; and

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3:

(A) an individual claim for an Environmental Defect for which a valid claim
notice is given prior to the Defect Claim Date shall only generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price if the Environmental Defect Amount
with respect thereto exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (for
avoidance of doubt the value of any single Environmental Defect that affects
multiple Properties may be aggregated across such multiple Properties for
purposes of determining if this amount has been met); and

 

(B) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate of all Environmental
Defect Amounts which would generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 3.9(c)(iv)(A) exceeds two and one-half percent
(2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent that
such aggregate amount exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

3.10 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 3.7(c), with respect to any Disputed Matter
concerning Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and/or Title
Benefit Amounts (" _Disputed Title Matters_ "), on or before a date that is
ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall submit all
remaining Disputed Title Matters to a title attorney with at least ten (10)
years experience in oil and gas titles in the state in which the applicable
Property or Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of
Purchaser and Seller (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). If Purchaser and Seller
have not agreed upon a Person to serve as Title Arbitrator during such ten
(10) Business Day period, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after
the end of such initial ten (10) Business Day period, formally apply to the
Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association to choose the
Title Arbitrator and submit such Disputed Title Matters along with such
application. The Title Arbitrator shall not have 

 



-27-  worked as an employee or outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have any
financial interest in the dispute other than the payment of the Title
Arbitrators fees and expenses incurred as Title Arbitrator. With respect to
any Disputed Title Matters which Purchaser has not submitted to the Title
Arbitrator or the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association, as applicable, within the relevant time periods set
forth above (or, with respect to Disputed Title Matters concerning Title
Defects Seller has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to Section 3.7(a), the
date set forth in Section 3.7(c)), Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived
its dispute of such Disputed Title Matters, as applicable.

(b) Except as provided in Section 3.7(c), with respect to any Disputed Matter
concerning Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts (" _Disputed
Environmental Matters_ "), on or before a date that is ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall submit all remaining Disputed
Environmental Matters to a reputable environmental consultant with at least
ten (10) years experience in corrective environmental action regarding oil
and gas properties in the state in which the applicable Property or
Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and
Seller (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ "). If Purchaser and Seller have not
agreed upon a Person to serve as Environmental Arbitrator during such ten
(10) Business Day period, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after
the end of such initial ten (10) Business Day period, formally apply to the
Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association to choose the
Environmental Arbitrator and submit such Disputed Environmental Matters along
with such application. The Environmental Arbitrator shall not have worked as
an employee or outside consultant for any Party or its Affiliates during the
five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest
in the dispute other than the payment of the Environmental Arbitrators fees
and expenses incurred as Environmental Arbitrator. With respect to
any Disputed Environmental Matters which Purchaser has not submitted to the
Environmental Arbitrator or the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association, as applicable, within the relevant time periods set
forth above (or, with respect to Disputed Environmental Matters concerning
Environmental Defects Seller has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to
Section 3.7(a), the date set forth in Section 3.7(c)), Purchaser shall be
deemed to have waived its dispute of such Disputed Environmental Matters, as
applicable.

(c) In each case above, the arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section 3.10. The Title Arbitrators or
Environmental Arbitrators determination, as applicable, shall be made within
forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making their
respective determinations, the Title Arbitrator and the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this Article 3 and may consider
such other matters as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator or Environmental
Arbitrator (as applicable), are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator,
including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator and Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as experts for the limited purpose of determining the
specific Disputed Matters submitted by any Party and may not award damages,
interest, or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting
their respective cases to any Title Arbitrator or Environmental Arbitrator
pursuant to this Section 3.10. Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Title Arbitrator and Environmental Arbitrator, and Seller
shall be responsible for the remaining one-half of the costs and expenses.

 



-28- 3.11 _Notice to Holders of Consent and Preferential Purchase Rights_. No
later than three (3) Business Days after the date hereof, Seller shall
prepare and send (a) notices to the holders of any consents to the assignment
of the Assets (including to the holders of Material Consents to assignment
that are set forth on  _Schedule 4.8_ but excluding any consent or approval
of Governmental Authorities customarily obtained after Closing) requesting
consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) notices to
the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar
rights that are set forth on _Schedule 4.8_ in compliance with the terms of
such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents and waivers described
in this Section 3.11; provided that Seller shall not be required to make any
payments or undertake any material obligations for the benefit of the holders
of such rights in order to obtain the consents and waivers. Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in seeking to
obtain such consents, approvals, permissions, and waivers.

 

3.12 _Consent Requirements_.

 

(a) Unless the Parties otherwise agree, in no event shall there be transferred
at Closing any Asset for which a Material Consent has not been obtained prior
to Closing. Seller shall deliver a written notice to Purchaser on or before
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing setting forth each Material Consent
requirement which, as of such date, has not been satisfied or waived.

 

(b) In cases in which the Asset subject to such an un-obtained Material
Consent is an Asset other than a Property, and Purchaser is assigned the
Property or Properties to which such Asset relates, but such Asset is not
transferred to Purchaser due to the un-waived Material Consent requirement,
the Parties shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Material Consent so that such Asset can be transferred
to Purchaser upon receipt of the Material Consent, and, if permitted pursuant
to applicable Law and agreement, such Asset shall be held by Seller for the
benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder or with
respect thereto, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the performance of any
obligations under or with respect to such Asset to the extent that Purchaser
has been transferred the Assets necessary to such performance until the
applicable Material Consent is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall not be required to make any payments or undertake any
material obligations for the benefit of the holders of any un-obtained
Material Consents subject to this Section 3.12(b).

 

(c) In cases in which the Asset subject to such a Material Consent requirement
is a Property and the Material Consent to the transfer of such Property is
not obtained by Closing, either Party may elect to exclude the Property
subject to such Material Consent and, subject to the remainder of this Section
3.12(c), (i) the affected Property shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at
Closing, (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by
the Allocated Value of such Property, (iii) such Property shall be deemed to
be deleted from _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit A_ _-2_ and/or _Exhibit A_ _-5_
attached hereto and added to _Schedule 1.3_ attached hereto and (iv) such
Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder. If
any such Material Consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 2.3(b) is subsequently
satisfied prior to the date of the final adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) or Section 8.4(c), (A) Seller shall,
promptly after such Material Consent requirement is satisfied, convey the
applicable Property to Purchaser, (B) the Parties shall deliver all
instruments and documents that would have been required under the terms
hereof to be delivered at Closing with respect to such Properties at Closing;
(C) Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the applicable
Property, pay the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable adjustments with respect to
such Property (or portion thereof) under this Agreement, calculated for the
period from and after the Effective Date to the date of the conveyance) to
Seller with interests at the Agreed Rate from Closing, and (D) such Property
shall no longer be deemed to be (x) deleted from _Exhibit A_ _-1_ , _Exhibit
A_ _-2_ and/or _Exhibit A_ _-5_ attached hereto, (y) added to _Schedule 1.3_
attached hereto and (z) an Excluded Asset for any purposes hereunder.

 



-29- 3.13 _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

 

(a) Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 on the dates set forth herein. The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Asset, adjusted as set forth herein.

(b) If any preferential right to purchase any Asset is validly exercised prior
to Closing, (i) the affected Asset shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at
Closing, (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Asset, (iii) such Asset shall be deemed to be deleted from the
Exhibits attached hereto and added to _Schedule 1.3_ attached hereto, (iv)
such Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder, and
(v) Seller shall convey the affected Asset to the preferential right holder on
the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential right
provision and shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder.

(c) Should a third Person fail to validly exercise or waive its preferential
right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing, and the
time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired by Closing, then (i) such
Assets (or portions thereof) shall not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing,
(ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
each such Asset (or portion thereof); (iii) each such affected Asset (or
portion thereof) shall be subject to the remainder of this Section 3.13(c)
and Section 3.13(d), and (iv) Seller shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts (without the obligation to make any payments or undertake
any obligations for the benefit of the holders of such preferential rights to
purchase) to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase right and shall
continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith. Should the holder of
the preferential purchase right validly exercise the same after Closing, (A)
such affected Asset shall be deemed to be deleted from the Exhibits attached
hereto and added to _Schedule 1.3_ attached hereto, (B) such Asset (or portion
thereof) shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder, and
(C) Seller shall convey the affected Asset (or portion thereof) to the
preferential right holder on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential right provision and Seller shall be entitled to the
consideration paid by such holder.

(d) In the event that, after Closing, a preferential purchase right with
respect to an Asset (or portion thereof) not conveyed to Purchaser at Closing
pursuant to Section 3.13(c) is waived or the time for exercise of such right
has expired pursuant to its terms without exercise by the holder thereof, (i)
Purchaser shall purchase the affected Asset (or portion thereof) on the terms
set forth in this Agreement at a delayed closing which shall occur within ten
(10) Business Days following the date on which Seller obtains such waiver, or
the time period for exercising the applicable preferential right has expired
(which date shall, with respect to such Asset, or portion thereof, be
considered to be the Closing Date), (ii) the Parties shall deliver all
instruments and documents that would have been required under the terms hereof
to be delivered at Closing with respect to such Asset at such delayed
Closing; and (iii) Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the
applicable Asset (or portion thereof), pay the amount of any previous
deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable
adjustments with respect to such Property under this Agreement) to Seller with
interest at the Agreed Rate from the Closing Date, and (iv) such Asset shall
no longer be (A) deemed to be deleted from the Exhibits attached hereto, (B)
added to _Schedule 1.3_ attached hereto (C) an Excluded Asset for any purposes
hereunder. Purchase Price adjustments calculated in the same manner as the
adjustments in Section 2.3 with respect to the affected Asset (or portion
thereof), if any, shall be calculated from the period from and after the
Effective Date to the date of the conveyance, and the net amount of such
adjustment, if positive, shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller, and, if
negative, by Seller to Purchaser.

and Environmental Defects shall terminate as of the Defect Claim Date and

Environmental Defect or Title Defect claim properly reported on or before the

by Purchaser, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will not (a) violate any provision of the certificate of formation,

this Agreement or any agreement or transaction contemplated hereby.

 

5.12 _Qualification; Bonding_. Without limiting Section 12.4, Purchaser is, or
as of the Closing will be, qualified under applicable Laws to hold Leases,

applicable Governmental Authority. Purchaser has, or as of the Closing will
have, posted such bonds and other financial assurances, and provided such
evidence of financial responsibility, as may be required for the ownership and
operation of the Assets. To Purchasers knowledge, no fact or condition exists
with respect to Purchaser which may cause any Governmental Authority to
withhold its approval of the assignment of the Assets to Purchaser
contemplated herein or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.13 _Bankruptcy_. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership

subsequent to, the Closing, (a) Purchaser will not have incurred, nor does it
intend to or believe that it will incur, debts (including contingent
obligations) beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature or come
due (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received from
any source, and amounts to be payable on or in respect of debts), (b) the
amount of cash available to Purchaser after taking into account all other
anticipated uses of funds is anticipated to be sufficient to pay all such
amounts on or in respect of debts, when such amounts are required to be paid,
and (c) Purchaser will have sufficient capital with which to conduct its
business.

costs, expenses, or the obligation to undertake any liability or other
material obligations to or by Seller) to obtain permission for Purchaser to
gain access to third Person operated Properties to inspect the condition of
the same. Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany Purchaser
and its representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets.

 

6.2 _Notification of Breaches_. Until the Closing,

 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual

covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the
Closing Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material
respect, but, in each case, if such breach of representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement shall (if curable) be cured to the reasonable
satisfaction of the non-breaching Party on or before the Closing, then such
breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

6.3 _Press Releases_. Until the Closing, neither Seller nor Purchaser, nor any

information and (iv) by Purchaser in connection with any investor
presentations, securities filings, press releases or similar disclosures to
the extent such disclosures are made concurrently with or after Purchasers or

Seller. Seller and Purchaser shall each be liable for the compliance of its
respective Affiliates, and Seller shall be responsible for the compliance by
EnCap and its Affiliates, with the terms of this Section. The Parties agree
that neither Purchaser nor Seller will have an adequate remedy at law if any
of the foregoing Persons violate (or threaten to violate) any of the terms of

LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH PERSONS. PURCHASER RECOGNIZES

normal business hours and at their normal locations of business in connection
with the same; provided further that the access and cooperation obligations
contained in this Section 6.10 shall not unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of Seller. Without limitation of Sellers
obligations of cooperation contained in this Section 6.10, Seller makes no
representation or warranty to Purchaser as to the Sellers ability to provide
all the information necessary for Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including Purchasers parent) to obtain any Potential Financing, comply with
the requirements of any Governmental Authority (including the United States

6.11 _Confidentiality_. Seller and Purchaser each acknowledge that
confidential information of the other may be disclosed to, made available to,
or otherwise obtained by such Party (in its capacity as the recipient of such
confidential information, the " _Receiving Party_ "), whether prior to or
after the date of this Agreement. Receiving Party may disclose such
information to its Affiliates and to its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives, consultants, contractors,
attorneys, advisors, lenders (current and prospective) and investors (current
and prospective) who need to know such information for the purpose of aiding
such Party in the transactions contemplated hereby or matters relating
thereto; provided, however, that, subject to the remainder of this Section
6.11, until the first to occur of the one year anniversary of the Closing or
the one year anniversary of the termination of this Agreement, Receiving Party
agrees to maintain (and to cause its Affiliates, and its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, consultants,
contractors, attorneys, advisors, lenders and investors, to maintain) all
information made available to it pursuant to this Agreement confidential,
except to the extent such information (a) is or becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of a breach by Receiving Party of this
Section 6.11, (b) was (or becomes) available to Receiving Party (or its

stock exchange having jurisdiction over the Receiving Party or its Affiliates,
to be disclosed, (d) is required, by deposition, interrogatories, requests

so disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.11) or (e) as
may be required or permitted pursuant to the exercise of the rights and
fulfillment of the obligations of a Party under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.11, (y) where Purchaser is the Receiving Party, information
included in or related to the Assets transferred to Purchaser at Closing shall
not constitute confidential information as to Purchaser, provided, however,
that until one year after the Closing, Seller shall be subject to the non-
disclosure provisions contained herein with respect to such information as if
Seller was the Receiving Party of such information and (z) in the event that
this Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of Closing, any
information received by Seller as a Receiving Party with respect to the Assets
shall not constitute confidential information effective as of the date of the
termination of this Agreement .

6.12 _Certain Restrictions_. Except as hereinafter provided in this Section
6.12, pursuant to Section 6.14 or as necessary to cure any Title Defects, if
the Closing occurs, for a twelve (12) month period following the Closing,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (a) lease, acquire
any lease, "top lease" or right or option to lease any lands within Ward
County, Texas, regardless of whether it is alleged that a Lease is not in full
force and effect or (b) acquire all or substantially all of the equity
interests (or similar ownership interests) in a person if such persons real
and personal property includes leases, "top leases" or rights or option to
lease lands within Ward County, Texas; __provided, however__ , that the this
Section 6.12 shall not apply to, any transaction that covers lands that lie
partially within and

 



-46-  partially outside of the Ward County, Texas if the fair market value of the
interests being acquired that cover lands that lie within Ward County, Texas
constitutes less than ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of all
interests being acquired in connection with such transaction. For purposes of
this Section 6.12 only, the term "Affiliates" shall include any Person in
which any Key Person, directly or indirectly, owns an equity interest, is
employed or is a consultant; provided, however that (i) Constitution Resources
LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and (ii) EnCap, any private equity fund

any other Person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with EnCap other than Development, Upstream and Midstream
and any Person controlled by Development, Upstream or Midstream shall: (A)
not be subject to this Section 6.12, (B) have the right to buy mineral
interests and/or royalty interests or any other property interests within Ward
County, Texas or elsewhere and, in the case of the Persons described in
subpart (ii) of this Section 6.12 only, (C) have an unrestricted ability to

6.12.

 

6.13 _Exclusive Agreement_. In consideration of the time and expense to be
incurred by Purchaser in its evaluation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Seller agrees that until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement or the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its respective subsidiaries, Affiliates
or representatives to (a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission from
any Person of any proposal to directly or indirectly acquire any of the Assets
by such Person (any proposal for such a transaction, an "
_Alternative Proposal_ "), (b) enter into any agreement with respect to, or
approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal or (c) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to constitute, any Alternative Proposal (and any such activity
that is being undertaken as of the date of this Agreement shall be terminated
immediately). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.13 by any
representative or Affiliate of Seller (to the extent such Person is acting on
behalf of Sellers instructions) shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 6.13 by Seller.

6.14  _Additional Leases_. From and after the Execution Date until January 9,
2017 (the " _Additional Lease Acquisition Period_ "), Seller (or any Affiliate
of Seller) shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
acquire Additional Leases in accordance with this Section 6.14.

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 6.14_ sets forth a list of oil and gas leases that
Seller has identified as potential Additional Leases as of the Execution Date
(the " _Potential Additional Leases_ ") along with the estimated Net Acre and
Net Revenue Interest amounts, and the agreed upon amount that
would constitute the Allocated Value for, any such Potential Additional Lease
if it were to become an Additional Lease. Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to acquire all or any portion of the Potential Additional
Leases identified on  _Schedule_ __ _ 6.14_ pursuant to this Section 6.14
(such Potential Additional Lease, once so acquired by Seller prior to the
expiration of the Additional Lease Acquisition Period, shall then be
considered an Additional Lease and an Asset under this Agreement).

(b) If Seller acquires any Additional Lease(s) pursuant to this Section 6.14,
then with respect to each such Additional Lease that Seller adds to _Exhibit_
__ _ A-5_, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the
Allocated Value for such Additional Lease as provided in the final amended
_Schedule_ __ _ 2.2_ submitted pursuant to Section 6.14(e) (the aggregate of
all such Allocated Values for all of the Additional Leases added to _Exhibit_
__ _ A_ _-5_ in accordance with this Section 6.14, the " _Additional Lease
Amount_ ").

 



-47- (c) With respect to each such Additional Lease acquired by Seller (or any
Affiliate of Seller) pursuant to this Section 6.14, within three (3) Business
Days after the closing of its acquisition by Seller (or any Affiliate of
Seller), Seller shall deliver notice of such acquisition to Purchaser, and
pursuant to Section 6.1, Seller shall afford to Purchaser and Purchasers
representatives reasonable access (including information requests) to the
information in Sellers possession regarding the Additional Leases in order to
conduct a title review and environmental review in accordance with Article
3\.

(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.14, in no
event will (i) Seller acquire any Additional Lease that is burdened by
royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits
interests, production payments, carried interests, reversionary interests and
other burdens on, measured by or payable out of production that, in the
aggregate, are in excess of 25%, (ii) any overriding royalty interest be
created in favor of Seller or any of its Affiliates that will burden any
Additional Lease, or (iii) Seller assign to Purchaser any Contract in
connection with any Additional Lease other than Contracts to the extent they
are covenants running with the lands covered by the Additional Lease or
contain provisions expressly requiring the assignee of such Additional Lease
to assume the obligations thereunder.

(e) Purchaser agrees that, with respect to each Additional Lease acquired
pursuant to Section 6.14, Seller shall have the right, until January 9, 2017,
to supplement or amend _Exhibit_ __ _ A-5_, _Schedule 1.2(l)_ and _Schedule_
__ _ 2.2_ to reflect any Additional Lease by providing Purchaser a revised
copy of _Exhibit A-5_, _Schedule 1.2(l)_ and/or _Schedule_ __ _ 2.2 _with
updated information for all of the Additional Leases as well as (i) the
Effective Date with respect to such Additional Lease (which shall be the later
to occur of 12:01 a.m. in Houston, Texas on October 1, 2016 or 12:01 a.m. in
Houston, Texas on the effective date of the acquisition of such Additional
Lease by Seller (or its applicable Affiliate)) and (ii) Allocated Value
thereof, which Allocated Value shall be the amount (or applicable portion of
the amount) set forth for such Additional Lease on  _Schedule_ __ _ 6.14_,
and such revised _Exhibit A-5_, _Schedule 1.2(l)_ and/or _Schedule_ __ _ 2.2
_provided by Seller shall be deemed to replace the _Exhibit A-5_, _Schedule
1.2(l)_ and _Schedule_ __ _ 2.2 _attached to this Agreement as of Execution
Date in their entirety upon receipt by Purchaser, without any further action
by either of the Parties.

6.15 _Supplemental Disclosure_. Purchaser hereby agrees that, with respect to
the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article 4, until
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller may supplement or amend
the Seller Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising
after the Execution Date which, if existing at the Execution Date, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such Sellers Disclosure
Schedule. In the event that Seller supplements or amends the Seller Disclosure
Schedules pursuant to the preceding sentence, Seller shall deliver a copy of
the amendment or supplement (in either case, the " _Supplemental Disclosure_
") to the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have five (5) days after receipt of a
Supplemental Disclosure (the " _Termination Period_ ") in which to review the
Supplemental Disclosure or request additional information related thereto. If
a Supplemental Disclosure discloses facts that would constitute a breach of
the Sellers representations and warranties hereunder and such breach would
result in the failure of the Purchasers condition to Closing specified in
Section 7.2(a) to be satisfied at the Closing, the Purchaser may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b) by delivering a termination notice
to the Seller within the Termination Period (which termination notice shall
specify the representation or warranty breached, identify the specific facts
in the Supplemental Disclosure that constitute the breach, and describe why
the failure of such condition would reasonably be expected to occur);
provided, however, that the termination of this Agreement pursuant to a
termination notice delivered as provided in this Section 6.15 shall not be
effective unless the Seller fails to cure such breach within ten (10)
Business days following the date the Seller receives such termination notice;
provided __ further, however, that in the event such breach is not capable of
being cured by Seller, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to such
termination notice shall be effective as of the date such termination notice
was delivered to Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
except as provided in Article 11, Seller expressly acknowledges and agrees
that if the Closing shall occur, Purchaser shall not

 



-48-  waive or release (nor shall Purchaser be deemed to have waived or released)
any indemnification claims to which it is entitled to make with respect to any
matters disclosed pursuant to any Supplemental Disclosure against any member
of the Seller Group for indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or otherwise. For all purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 have been fulfilled, the Seller Disclosure Schedules contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained
therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information
contained in any Supplemental Disclosure.

shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best
information available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating

-52-  opportunity to review and discuss the preliminary settlement statement with
Seller, provided, however, Seller shall not be required to make any changes
thereto to which Seller does not agree (provided, that the foregoing shall
not limit Purchasers rights under Section 8.4(b) and (c)). The estimate
delivered in accordance with this Section 8.4(a), less the Deposit and the
Defect Escrow Amount as determined pursuant to Section 3.8(e), shall
constitute the dollar amount to be payable by Purchaser to Seller at the
Closing (the " _Closing Payment_ ").

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a draft statement setting forth the final calculation of
the Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment under
Section 2.3, based on the most recent actual figures available for
each adjustment. Seller shall, at Purchasers request, make such reasonable
documentation as is in Sellers possession available to support the final
figures. As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the thirtieth
(30th) day following receipt of such statement from Seller, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that Purchaser
proposes be made to such statement. Seller may deliver a written report to
Purchaser during this same period reflecting any changes that Seller proposes
to be made to such statement as a result of additional information received
after the statement was prepared. If Purchaser does not deliver such report to
Seller on or before the end of such thirty (30) day period, Purchaser shall
be deemed to have agreed with Sellers statement, and such statement shall
become final and binding upon the Parties.

 

(c) The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the
Purchase Price no later than forty-five (45) days after delivery of Sellers
statement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within such
period of time, any Party may refer the items of adjustment which are in
dispute to, the Houston, Texas office of BDO USA, LLP, or, if such firm is not
able or willing to serve, a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm
or consulting firm mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Accounting Arbitrator_ "), for review and final determination by arbitration.
If Purchaser and Seller have not agreed upon a mutually acceptable alternate
Person to serve as Accounting Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days of
receiving notice of BDO USA, LLPs unavailability, Seller shall, within ten
(10) Business Days after the end of such initial ten (10) Business Day
period, formally apply to the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association to choose the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 8.4(c). The Accounting Arbitrators determination shall be made
within forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In
determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of Article 2 and may not
increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of Purchase Price
adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest (except
as expressly provided for in this Section 8.4(c)) or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear their own
legal and accounting fees and other costs of presenting its case to the
Accounting Arbitrator. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator. Within ten
(10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchasers thirty (30)
day review period without delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on
which the Parties or the Accounting Arbitrator finally determine the Purchase
Price, (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase
Price (less the Deposit) exceeds the Closing Payment or (y) Seller shall pay
to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the Purchase
Price (less the Deposit), as applicable. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to
this Section 8.4 shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the Agreed Rate (without duplication of interest at the Agreed Rate
paid under any other provision of this Agreement).

 



-53- (d) Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to assist Seller in preparation of
the final statement of the Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b) by furnishing
invoices, receipts, reasonable access to personnel, and such other assistance
as may be reasonably requested by Seller to facilitate such process post-
Closing.

 

(e) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Seller shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
as may be specified by Seller in writing. All payments made or to be made
hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer or immediately
available funds to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing.

Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period in which the Hydrocarbons giving
rise to such severance or production Taxes are sold except, if sold prior to
the Effective Date, but the proceeds are not paid or received on or prior to
the Cut-Off Date, Purchaser shall bear such Taxes, (ii) Asset Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (i)), shall be
allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset
Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other
Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall
be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately
prior to the Effective Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
on the Effective Date by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of
days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the Effective Date
(which for the avoidance of doubt shall not begin before the date on which
ownership of the applicable Assets giving rise to liability for the
particular Asset Tax), on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on or after the Effective Date, on the other hand.

 

(c) Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) prior to delinquency, all Asset
Taxes that become due after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall send to Seller
a statement that apportions each Asset Tax pursuant to this Section 9.1(c)
based upon the amount of Asset Taxes actually invoiced and paid to the
applicable Governmental Authority by Purchaser. Such statement shall be
accompanied by proof of Purchasers actual payment of such Asset Taxes.
Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of each such statement and proof of
payment, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for Sellers allocated portion of
such Asset Taxes less any amounts reflected as a reduction in the purchase
price for the Assets.

Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to
the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer
Taxes.

 



-54- 9.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser agree to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

 

9.4 _1031 Like-Kind Exchange Cooperation_. Seller and Purchaser agree that
either or both of Seller and Purchaser may elect to treat the acquisition or
sale of the Assets as an exchange of like-kind property under section 1031 of
the Code (an " _Exchange_ "). Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the other Party in the completion of such an Exchange
including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the right at any
time prior to Closing to assign its rights under this Agreement to a qualified
intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term
is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect
an Exchange. In connection with any such Exchange, any exchange accommodation
title holder shall have taken all steps necessary to own the Assets under
applicable Law. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment
of a Partys rights under this Agreement for purposes of an Exchange nor any
other actions taken by a Party or any other person in connection with the
Exchange shall release any Party from, or modify, any of their respective
liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other)
under this Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any
particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of
such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange.
Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an
Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as
a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the
other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all
costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold the other Party,
its Affiliates, and its and their respective former, current and future
partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
Damages and taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the
electing Partys Exchange election.

 

9.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. _Schedule_ __ _ 9.5_ sets forth the
allocation of the Purchase Price, Assumed Obligations, and any other items
constituting consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent
known at such time) among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code (and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder). Seller and
Purchaser agree to amend _Schedule_ __ _ 9.5_ to reflect adjustments to the
Purchase Price and to report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
consistently with  _Schedule_ __ _ 9.5_, as adjusted by the Parties, on any
Tax Return, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and will not assert,
and will cause their Affiliates not to assert, in connection with any Tax

(a) Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller with written notice of any
inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by any Governmental
Authority, which relates to any of the Assets Taxes for any Tax period or
portion thereof prior to the Effective Date other than a Straddle Period.
Seller shall have the sole right to defend any such Tax proceeding relating to
any Tax period or portion thereof prior to the Effective Date, but not a
Straddle Period, provided that Seller shall not settle any such Tax proceeding
without the written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) The Parties shall promptly provide each other with notice of any
inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by any Governmental
Authority that relate to any of the Asset Taxes for any Straddle Period.
Purchaser and Seller shall jointly control the conduct of any Tax proceeding

shall settle any such Tax Proceeding without the written consent of the other
Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by any Governmental
Authority, which relates to any of the Assets Taxes for any Tax period or
portion thereof after to the Effective Date other than a Straddle Period.

have the right to control all other proceedings with respect to Asset Taxes.

ARTICLE 10

 

TERMINATION

10.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing: (a) by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser, (b)
by Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.15, if applicable, or (c) by either Seller
or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or before the earlier to occur
of (i) February 28, 2017 or (ii) the expiration of any applicable cure period
provided to Seller pursuant to Section 6.8 with respect to a breach that is
the subject of a termination notice delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section
6.15; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no Party shall be entitled to terminate
this Agreement under Section 10.1(b) if the Closing has failed to occur
because such Party failed to perform or observe in any material respect its
covenants and agreements hereunder or such Party is in material breach of its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, subject to the remainder of this Section 10.2 and Section 10.3,
this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for
the provisions of Article 1, this Article 10, Sections 3.4(b), 4.9, 4.16, 5.8,
5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 6.3, 6.5, 6.11, 11.4 (as it relates to claims under Section
6.5), 12.2, 12.3, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.11, 12.13, 12.14, 12.16, 12.17,
and 12.18, all of which shall continue in full force and effect) and Seller
shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and
to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the
Assets to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the termination
of this Agreement under Section 10.1 shall not relieve any Party from
liability for any failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of
its agreements or covenants contained herein that are to be performed or
observed at or prior to Closing or its material breach of its representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is
terminated by Seller under Section 10.1, and Purchaser has failed to perform
or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants
contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing
or is in material breach of its representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement, then Seller shall be 

 



-56-  entitled, at its sole and exclusive remedy, to retain the Deposit, free of
any claims by Purchaser or any other Person. In such event, Seller and
Purchaser shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to disburse the Deposit together with any income thereon to Seller. It
is expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of Damages
resulting from any termination of the type set forth in this Section 10.2
would be difficult to determine accurately because of the unique nature of
this Agreement, the unique nature of the Assets, the uncertainties of
applicable commodity markets and differences of opinion with respect to such
matters, and that the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the amount of
the Deposit hereunder (a) represents a reasonable estimate of the minimum
amount of Damages that the Seller would suffer as a result of such
a termination and (b) represents reasonable consideration for the Seller
removing the Assets from the marketplace during the period from the Execution
Date until the such a termination hereof. In the event this Agreement
is terminated by Purchaser under Section 10.1, and Seller has failed to
perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants
contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing
or is in material breach of its representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement, then Purchaser shall receive back the Deposit, free of any
claims by Seller or any other Person (and in such event, Seller and Purchaser
shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Deposit together with any income thereon to Purchaser) and
Purchaser shall be entitled to all remedies available at Law and shall be
entitled to recover court costs and attorneys fees in addition to any other
relief to which Purchaser may be entitled whether under this Agreement or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Party has the
right to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1 and the other Party has
failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior
to Closing or is in material breach of its representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement, in lieu of terminating this Agreement or seeking its
other remedies provided for in this Section 10.2, it may seek specific
performance of this Agreement without the necessity of posting bond or
furnishing other security. Each Party understands and agrees that the other
Party may suffer irreparable damage as a result of it failing to perform or
observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained
herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing or being
in material breach of its representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement. Accordingly, each Party waives any right it may have to challenge
the enforceability of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and
agrees it will not argue in any proceeding that the requirements for specific
performance have not been met, that monetary damages constitute a sufficient
remedy or make any other argument in opposition to the specific performance
of this Agreement.

10.3 _Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, other than a termination by Seller as permitted
pursuant to Section 10.1 and of the Purchaser has failed to perform or observe
in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein
which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing or is in
material breach of its representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the Deposit, free of any claims
by Seller or any other Person with respect thereto. In such event, Seller and
Purchaser shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to disburse the Deposit together with any income thereon to Purchaser.

-60- 11.4 _Indemnification Actions_. Except as provided in Article 11, all claims
for indemnification under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or Section 11.3 shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such
Damages pursuant to this Article 11, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ "
when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the
right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article
11, Section 6.5 or Section 9.4 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
Persons identified in Section 11.4(g)).

 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or
Article 11, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its
claim, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Person (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the
Claim and shall enclose a complete copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to
give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.4 shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or
Article 11, except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend
against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Persons ability
to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant,
or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement that was inaccurate or breached and the basis of such
inaccuracy or breach.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Person against such Claim
under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or this Article 11, as applicable. If the
Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty
(30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies
its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively
deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified
Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period but
prior to the Indemnifying Person admitting (or being deemed to have admitted
such obligation pursuant to this Section 11.4(c)) its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to the matter in question, to file any motion,
answer, or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation (or is deemed to have
admitted its obligation), it shall have the right and obligation
to diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this
Section 11.4(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a
final, non-appealable, resolution of the Indemnified Persons liability with
respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional
written release of the Indemnified Person from all further liability in
respect of such Claim) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

 



-61- (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend, indemnify against, or settle the
Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the
Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume
the defense of the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final, non-
appealable determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet
admitted its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Person, the
Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of
any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for
ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its
obligation for indemnification with respect to such Claim and (ii) if its
obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Claim, including the
power to reject the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any
Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying
Person has timely admitted its obligation for indemnification in writing (or
is deemed to be obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Person pursuant to
Section 11.4(c) or this Section 11.4(e)), the Indemnified Person shall be
deemed to have waived any right to indemnity therefor.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim,
the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation
to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages, or (iii) dispute
the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder, subject to the other provisions of this Article 11\.

(g) Any claim for indemnity under Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or Article 11 by
any Affiliate, partner, member, shareholder, owner, officer, director,
manager, employee, agent or representative must be brought and administered by
the applicable Party to this Agreement that is related to such Person. No
Indemnified Person other than Seller and Purchaser shall have any rights
against Seller or Purchaser under the terms of Section 6.5, Section 9.4 or
Article 11 except as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or Seller,
as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.4(g). Seller and Purchaser may
elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section
11.4 on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its
sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified
Person for any action or inaction under this Section 11.4.

 

11.5 _Casualty and Condemnation_.

 

(a) Subject to the Sellers representations, warranties and covenants made
pursuant to this Agreement, from and after the Effective Date, if Closing
occurs, Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to production of
Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including watering out of any Well,
collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of
any Equipment due to ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to
the Assets.

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion
of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is expropriated or
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a " _Casualty
Loss_ "), Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and Purchase
shall have the option to (i) require Seller, at the Closing, to pay to
Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by non-Affiliate third Persons by reason of
such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall

Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards
and other rights against non-Affiliate third Persons arising out of such
Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall reserve and retain (and Purchaser shall assign to Seller)
all rights, title, interests and claims against third Persons who are not
Affiliates of Seller for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred
prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or
other rights against such third Persons with respect to any such Casualty
Loss or (ii) exclude the affected Assets from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in which case (A) the affected Asset shall not be conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing, (B) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced at
Closing by the Allocated Value of such Asset, (C) such Asset shall be deemed
to be deleted from _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-1_ ,  _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-2_ and/or
_Exhibit_ __ _ A_ _-5_ attached hereto and added to _Schedule_ __ _
1.3_ attached hereto and (D) such Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset
for all purposes hereunder.

11.6 _Limitation on Actions_.

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller in Article 4 (excluding
Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.9, 4.10, and 4.14) and the covenants and agreements
of the Parties in Article 6, (excluding Sections 6.5 and 6.7), and the
corresponding representations, warranties, and affirmations given in the
certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(f) and 8.3(e), as
applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months and
the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 4.3 shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. The representation and warranty of Seller set forth in Section
4.7 shall survive the Closing until the Cut-Off Date. The remainder of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and delivery of the Assignment and Bill
of Sale without time limit except as may otherwise be expressly provided
herein. Representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements shall be of no
further force and effect after the date of their expiration (if applicable),
provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement prior to its expiration date.

 

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.3(a)(ii), 11.3(a)(iii), 11.3(b)(ii), and
11.3(b)(iii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that is subject to
indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Person on or before such termination date in accordance with Section 11.4.
The indemnity in Section 11.3(b)(i) shall survive the Closing without time
limit except that such indemnity shall survive (i) as set forth in Sections
2.3 and 2.4 with respect to Section 11.2(b) and (ii) until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the matters set forth in
Sections 11.2(c), 11.2(d), 11.2(e), 11.2(f), 11.2(g) and 11.2(l). The
indemnities in Sections 11.3(a)(i) and 11.3(a)(iv) shall survive the Closing
without time limit.

(c) No Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under Section
11.3, for an individual matter until and unless the amount of the liability
for Damages with respect to which such Party admits (or it is otherwise
finally determined that such Party has) an obligation to indemnify the other
Party pursuant to the terms of Section 11.3 exceeds One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) (the " _Individual Indemnity Threshold_ "). Without
limiting the foregoing, Seller shall not have any liability for any
indemnification under Sections 11.3(b)(ii) or 11.3(b)(iii) until and unless
the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages (i) for which Claim
Notices are delivered by Purchaser under Sections 11.3(b)(ii) and
11.3(b)(iii), (ii) with respect to which Seller admits (or it is otherwise
finally determined) that Seller has an obligation to indemnify Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of under Sections 11.3(b)(ii) or 11.3(b)(iii), and (iii)
which exceed the Individual Indemnity Threshold exceeds two percent (2.0%) of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed
two percent (2.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 11.6(c) shall not limit 

 



-63-  indemnification for breach of the (A) Retained Obligations set forth in
Section 11.2(a), 11.2(b), 11.2(c), 11.2(k), 11.2(h), 11.2(i), and 11.2(j), (B)
representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.9, 4.10, 4.14, (C)
Purchasers representations and warranties in Article 5, (D) the covenants and
agreements set forth in Sections 6.5 or 6.7, or (E) the indemnity obligations
set forth in 11.3(a)(iv).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under Sections
11.3(b)(ii) and 11.3(b)(iii) for aggregate Damages in excess of fifteen
percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this Section 11.6(d) shall not limit indemnification for breach of the
representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.9, 4.10, 4.14, or the
covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.7.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
have no obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Person for any Damages
resulting from any environmental remediation, removal or other response action
undertaken by any Indemnified Person to the extent attributable to the (i)
costs of such remediation, removal or other response action in excess of the
least stringent permissible legal cleanup standard under Environmental Law or
required by a Governmental Authority, in each case, existing as of the Closing
Date or, if more stringent, as required under the express remediation
obligations set forth in any applicable Lease, or (ii) costs results from
meeting a more stringent cleanup standard resulting from a change in land use
by an Indemnified Person from the use in effect as of the Closing Date.

 

(f) With respect to any investigation, remediation or other response action
related to Damages for which Purchaser seeks indemnification from Seller
pursuant to this Article 11, Purchaser hereby agrees to provide Seller with
copies of all related reports and communications submitted to any Governmental
Authority and the results of all sampling and analysis activities within
three (3) Business Days after receipt thereof by Purchaser.

(g) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the
proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified
Person or its Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be
required to seek recovery under any policy of insurance as a condition to
indemnification hereunder.

 

(h) Any Purchaser Group Indemnified Person shall remit to Seller, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt, any insurance proceeds or other payment that
is received by any member of the Purchaser Group from a third Person and which
relates to Damages for which (but only to the extent) such member of the
Purchaser Group has been previously compensated hereunder (minus
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such recovery).

 

(i) Any Seller Group Indemnified Person shall remit to Purchaser, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt, any insurance proceeds or other payment that
is received by any member of the Seller Group from a third Person and which
relates to Damages for which (but only to the extent) such member of the
Seller Group has been previously compensated hereunder (minus the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such recovery).

 

11.7 _Indemnity Escrow_. In order to provide security for Sellers
indemnification obligations under this Article 11 and Sellers special
warranty granted in the Assignment and Bill of Sale, the Indemnity Escrow
shall be held by Escrow Agent, and disbursed by Escrow Agent after the Closing
in accordance with this Section 11.7 and the Escrow Agreement. With respect
to each claim for indemnification asserted by Purchaser against Seller
pursuant to this Article 11 or special warranty claim

 



-64-  asserted by Purchaser pursuant to the Assignment and Bill of Sale and
Section 3.1(c) during the period from and after the Closing Date up to the
date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Escrow
Termination Date_ "), upon final resolution or determination of such an
indemnity or special warranty claim by the Parties or in accordance with
Section 11.4, as applicable, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly instruct
Escrow Agent to disburse to Purchaser the amount set forth in such joint
instruction, which will be that portion of the Indemnity Escrow being held in
the Escrow Account as would satisfy such finally resolved or determined
indemnity or special warranty claim. On the Escrow Termination Date, Seller
shall be entitled to receive the Indemnity Escrow balance as of such time and
such amount shall be automatically distributed to Seller pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement (and Purchaser and Seller shall jointly instruct
Escrow Agent to take any necessary actions in order to accomplish the
foregoing). If there are remaining amounts due by Seller to Purchaser pursuant
to the indemnity obligations under this Article 11 after the Indemnity Escrow
balance is exhausted, then such amounts shall be promptly paid to Purchaser by
Seller as they are agreed by the Parties or finally determined in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that Purchaser asserts any
Damages for which it believes it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article 11 or any special warranty claims pursuant to the Assignment and
Bill of Sale and Section 3.1(c), Purchaser shall pursue such claims against
the Indemnity Escrow first, and Seller shall not have any personal liability
for such claims unless and until the Indemnity Escrow is exhausted, and then
only as further limited in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. On
the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller fifty
percent (50%) of the amount of the Indemnity Escrow balance as of such
time, excluding those amounts attributable to any claim for indemnification
asserted as of such date by Purchaser against Seller pursuant to this Article
11 or special warranty claim asserted by Purchaser pursuant to the Assignment
and Bill of Sale and Section 3.1(c) that has not been previously satisfied as
of such date.

understand that none of the bonds, supplemental bonds, third Person
indemnities, letters of credit, guarantees and other securities, if any,
posted by Seller or any Affiliate thereof with or for the benefit of any

-66- 12.5 _Records_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser
the original Records (or digital copies of Records to the extent Seller does
not have originals of such Records) that are in the possession of Seller or

(b) Seller may retain a copy of all data room materials for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement along with the originals of those Records (i)
relating to Tax and accounting matters, (ii) relating to Properties in which
Seller retains any interest, or (iii) which are subject to a legal hold by
Seller (until such hold is released) and provide Purchaser, at its request,
with copies of such Records other than Records that pertain solely to income
Tax matters related to the Assets. Seller may retain copies of any other
Records, including geological, geophysical, and similar data and studies.

(c) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing shall: (i)

12.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of Laws that would
direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

12.7 _Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party consents to personal
jurisdiction in any action brought in the United States federal courts
located in the State of Texas with respect to any dispute, claim, or
controversy arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with, this
Agreement, and each of the Parties agrees that any action instituted by it
against the other with respect to any such dispute, controversy, or claim
(except to the extent a dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, in
relation to, or in connection with, title or environmental matters pursuant to
Section 3.10 or the determination of Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to
Section 8.4(b) is referred to an expert pursuant to those Sections) will be
instituted exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Texas, Houston Division. Each Party (a) irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (b) waives any objection to laying
venue in any such action or proceeding in such courts, (c) waives any
objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over it, and (d) agrees that service of process upon it may be
effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail (or any substantially
similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address specified
in Section 12.2. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service of
process shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Texas for any purpose except as provided herein and shall not be
deemed to confer any rights on any Person other than the Parties to this
Agreement. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING,
OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER IN ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER
ARISING OUT OF, IN RELATION TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT.

12.8 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only
and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

 



-67- 12.9 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of
its obligations, agreements, or conditions herein contained may be waived by
the Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party
to whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in
any other manner. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Purchaser, or
their respective Affiliates and its and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives or any failure by Seller or Purchaser
to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to
enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver of, or consent to a
change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof
(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

12.10 _Assignment_. Other than as permitted by Section 9.4, no Party shall
assign (including by change of control, merger, consolidation, or stock
purchase) or otherwise transfer all or any part of this Agreement to any third
Person, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder
(including by change of control, merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) to
any third Person, without the prior written consent of the other Party and any
transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any
assignment of this Agreement permitted by this Section 12.10 shall be made
subject to the obligations contained in this Agreement and such assignment
shall not relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

12.11  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the documents to be executed hereunder and the exhibits and schedules attached
hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. In entering into this
Agreement, neither Party has relied on any statement, representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party or its representatives
other than those expressly contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Agreement constitutes a "definitive written agreement" as
contemplated by the Confidentiality Agreement and, as such, upon Closing the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate, effective as of the
Closing Date, or if Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms.

12.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by
an agreement in writing signed by Seller and Purchaser and expressly
identified as an amendment or modification.

12.13 _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any Person other than Purchaser and Seller to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided to
the Persons described in Section 6.5, Section 9.4 and Article 11\.

12.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and,
to the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or
the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed
deleted from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and the
validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein (and any other application of such provision) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

 

12.15 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action
is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to
be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day),
then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the
expiration of such period during which notice is required to be given or
action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

 



-68- 12.16 _References_. In this Agreement, unless the context requires
otherwise: (a) references to any gender includes a reference to all other
genders; (b) references to the singular includes the plural, and vice versa;
(c) reference to any Article or Section means an Article or Section of this
Agreement; (d) reference to any exhibit or schedule means an exhibit or

other provision of this Agreement; (f) references to "$" or "Dollars" means
United States Dollars; and (g) "include" and "including" mean include or
including without limiting the generality of the description preceding such
term.

 

12.17 _Construction_. Purchaser is capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Assets as a prudent purchaser would
deem appropriate under the circumstances, including with respect to all
matters relating to the Assets, their value, operation, and suitability.
Seller and Purchaser have had the opportunity to exercise business
discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details of the transaction
contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations
from equal bargaining positions. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement
shall not be construed against any Party, and no consideration shall be given
or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any
particular provision hereof.

 

12.18 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither Purchaser nor Seller, nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be entitled to consequential, special, or punitive damages in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by third Persons
for which responsibility is allocated between the Parties) and Purchaser and
Seller, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates, hereby
expressly waive any right to consequential, special, or punitive damages in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than consequential, special, or punitive damages suffered by third
Persons for which responsibility is allocated between the Parties).

 

12.19 _Joint and Several Liability_. Seller agrees and acknowledges that each
of Development, Upstream and Midstream shall be jointly and severally liable
for the obligations of Seller under this Agreement.

12.20 _Development as Representative of Seller_. Midstream and Upstream (each
a " _Seller Entity_ ") hereby irrevocably appoints Development as the agent
and attorney-in-fact of such Seller Entity for the purposes of acting in the
name and stead of such Seller Entity in: (a) giving and receiving all notices
permitted or required by this Agreement and acting on behalf of such Seller
Entity for all purposes under this Agreement; (b) dealing with the Purchaser
in connection with all adjustments under Section 2.3 or elsewhere under this
Agreement including, without limitation, all Title Defects and Environmental
Defects and any cures relating thereto and other accounting adjustments; (c)
acting on such Seller Entitys behalf under any other covenant, agreement or
provision of this Agreement; (d) agreeing with the Purchaser as to any
amendments to this Agreement which Development may deem necessary or
advisable, including but not limited to the extension of time in which to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the waiver of
any closing conditions; (e) employing legal counsel; (f) paying any legal and
any other fees and expenses incurred in consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (g) executing and acting for each Seller
Entity under the Escrow Agreement and (h) making, executing, acknowledging,
and delivering all such contracts, orders, receipts, notices, requests,
instructions, certificates, letters, and other writings, and in general doing
all things and taking all actions which Development, in its sole discretion,
may consider necessary or proper in connection with or to carry out the terms
of this Agreement, as fully as if such Seller Entity were personally present
and acting. This power of attorney and all authority conferred hereby is
granted and 

 



-69-  conferred subject to the interests of the other Parties to this Agreement,
and in consideration of those interests and for the purpose of completing the
transactions contemplated hereby, this power of attorney and all authority
conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by the
Seller Entities or by operation of Law or by the occurrence of any other
event. Purchaser shall be fully protected in relying conclusively without any
