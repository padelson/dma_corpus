claim by a third party or occurrence of any event which may give rise to a
claim for indemnification from an indemnifying party ("Indemnitor") under
this Article VIII, an indemnified party ("Indemnitee") shall notify the
Indemnitor in writing of such claim. The Indemnitor shall then have thirty
(30) days to advise the Indemnitee whether the Indemnitor accepts the defense
of such claim and Indemnitor shall have no obligation to Indemnitee for legal
fees incurred by Indemnitee before or after the date of any assumption of
the defense by Indemnitor. The Indemnitor shall in no way be liable to the
Indemnitee for any claim not presented to the Indemnitor by the Indemnitee
for a defense within thirty (30) days of the claim being presented in writing
to the Indemnitee by the party making the claim.

  



  

8.05 **_Right of Parties to Settle or Defend_**.  If the Indemnitor
determines to **** accept the defense of such claim, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to be represented by its own counsel at its own expense, its
participation to be subject to reasonable direction of the Indemnitor, and
the Indemnitee shall provide all requested waivers and authorities for the
Indemnitor to act on behalf of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor fails
to undertake the defense of or settle or pay any such third party claim
within 30 days after the Indemnitee has given written notice to the
Indemnitor of the claim, or if the Indemnitor, after having given such
notification to the Indemnitee, fails within 30 days to defend, settle or pay
such claim, then the Indemnitee may take any and all necessary action to
dispose of such claim; _provided,_   _however_ , that in no event shall the
Indemnitee settle such claim without the prior consent of the Indemnitor.

  



  

8.06 ** _Settlement Proposals_**. (a) In the event the Indemnitee desires to
settle any third-party claim the defense of which has not been assumed by
Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall advise the Indemnitor in writing of the
amount it proposes to pay in settlement

  



  

21   

     
   

  



  

thereof (the "Proposed Settlement"). The Indemnitor shall have twenty (20)
days after the Indemnitors receipt of the notice of the Proposed Settlement
to advise the Indemnitee whether it accepts the Proposed Settlement. If the
Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it accepts the Proposed Settlement or
does not deliver such notice within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice
from the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may offer the Proposed Settlement to the
third party making the claim. If after approval by the Indemnitor the
Proposed Settlement is not accepted by the party making such claim, any new
Proposed Settlement figure which the Indemnitee may wish to present to the
party making such claim shall again first be presented to the Indemnitor in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.06.

  



  

(b) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, the Indemnitor
may settle such third-party claim that it has agreed to accept the defense of
on any terms which it may deem reasonable. In the event the Indemnitor
desires to settle such third-party claim, the Indemnitor shall not without
the Indemnitees prior written consent, (i) settle or compromise
such proceeding, claim or demand, or consent to the entry of any judgment
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a written release from all
liability in respect of such proceeding, claim or demand or (ii) settle or
compromise any such proceeding, claim or demand, in any manner that may
materially adversely affect the Indemnitee. Following the Closing, the
indemnification obligations of this Article VIII shall be the
exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement and the Additional Agreements
and no other remedy shall be had in contract, tort or otherwise.

  



  

8.07 **_Reimbursement_**. At the time the amount of any liability on the part
of the Indemnitor under this Article VIII is determined (which in the case of
payments to third persons shall be the earlier of (i) the date of such
payments by the Indemnitee and (ii) the date that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall enter a final judgment, order or decree (after exhaustion
of appeal rights) establishing such liability), the Indemnitor shall, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of notice from the Indemnitee, pay to the
Indemnitee the amount of the indemnity claim.

  



  

8.08 **_Certain Adjustments_**. The parties agree that any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable law. Such payments shall be reduced to take account of any actual
Tax benefits realized by the Purchaser Indemnified party arising from the
incurrence or payment of the indemnifiable Claim by the indemnified party.

  



  

 ** _ARTICLE IX. TAX MATTERS_**.

  



  

9.01 **_Tax Returns and Payments; Refunds and Other Tax Matter_**.  (a)
Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed on
a timely basis all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and
its subsidiaries for Taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and pay all Tax amounts due. The parties agree that if the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is permitted, but not required, under applicable Tax laws to
treat the Closing date as the last day of a Tax Period, they will treat the
Tax period as ending on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide, or shall
cause the Company to provide, Seller with copies of any books or records
reasonably necessary for the preparation of such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed on a timely basis all other Tax Returns with respect to the Company and
its subsidiaries, including Tax Returns for Taxable periods that begin before
and end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), in a manner consistent
with past practice except as otherwise required by law; provided, however,
that no Tax Returns for a Straddle Period shall be filed without the prior

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Purchaser shall cause the Company and its subsidiaries to pay all Taxes shown
on such Tax Returns. Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser for (i) the
Income Tax on such returns that would have been due by Seller if the Closing
Date had been treated as the last date of the taxable period and (ii) the
portion of Taxes other than Income Taxes that relates to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, to the extent such Taxes in
clause (i) or (ii) above are not expressly provided for as Accrued Taxes on
the Closing Date Statement. For purposes of this Section 9.01(b), in the case
of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the portion of the Tax that relates to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed
to be the amount of the Tax for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period.

  



  

(c) Any Tax refunds that are received by Purchaser or its affiliates
(including the Company and its subsidiaries) and any amounts credited against
Tax to which Purchaser or its affiliates (including the Company and its
subsidiaries) become entitled and any other Tax benefit, in each case with
respect to Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries, for Tax periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, including portions of Straddle Periods that
end on the Closing Date, shall be for the account of Seller, and Purchaser
shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit or
Tax benefit within fifteen (15) days after the receipt or entitlement
thereto. Such payments shall be reduced to take account of any actual Tax
imposed upon Purchaser or its affiliates (including Company and its
subsidiaries) with respect to receipt of such tax refund or Tax benefit.
Purchaser agrees that it shall not, without Sellers consent, cause or permit
the Company or its subsidiaries to carry back to any pre-closing Tax period
any net operating loss, loss from operations or other Tax attribute, and
further agrees that Seller shall have no obligation under this Agreement to
return or remit any refund or other Tax benefit attributable to a breach by
Purchaser of the foregoing undertaking.

  



  

(d) Other than a Section 338(h)(10) Election, or any action which would not
result in additional Tax after taking into account the effect of a Section
338(h)(10) Election, Purchaser shall not take any action on the Closing Date
other than in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the sale of any assets or the distribution of
any dividend of the effectuation of any redemption, that would give rise to
any Tax liability of Seller or any of its affiliates or to an indemnification
obligation of Seller under this Agreement. On or after the Closing
Date, neither Purchaser nor Seller, respectively, shall amend any Tax Return,
consent to the waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to
Taxes of the Company or its subsidiaries, take any Tax position on any Tax
Return, or compromise or settle any Tax liability, in each case with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, if such action could have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of Seller or
Purchaser, respectively, in each case, without the other partys written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

9.02 **_Audits_**. (a) Seller shall conduct any audit of or proceeding
involving any Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or
forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Taxing authority with respect thereto and may, in its
sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner; provided, however, that in the event that Seller receives
a claim for Taxes or a notice of a pending or threatened audit from any

  



  

23   

     
   

  



  

Taxing authority in writing (a "Tax Claim") with respect to a Tax Return that
relates to the Company for any such period, Seller shall promptly notify
Purchaser of such Tax Claim and of any action taken or proposed to be taken.
In the event that Purchaser wishes to participate in such audit or
proceeding, it may do so at its own expense.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall, at its own expense, conduct any audit of or proceeding
involving any Taxable period ending after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that in the event that Purchaser receives a Tax Claim or a notice of
a Tax Claim with respect to a Tax Return that relates to the Company or its
subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of
such Tax Claim and of any action taken or proposed to be taken and shall
describe the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and provide to
Seller copies of any notice or other document received from any Taxing
Authority in respect of such asserted Tax liability. In the event that Seller
wishes to participate in such audit or proceeding, it may do so at its own
expense. Purchaser shall not, without Sellers consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise such Tax Claim
if doing so could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Seller.

  



  

9.03 **_Cooperation_** __. Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing

without limitation, either partys pursuit of judicial remedies as a result
of the other partys failure to comply with Section 6.07 hereof.

and Exhibits hereto and the documents referred to herein) contains, and is

provision.
