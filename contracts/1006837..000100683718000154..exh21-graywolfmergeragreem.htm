provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company shall be cancelled.

(ii) Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer, the
Stockholders or the Option Holders, each share of Restricted Stock that has
not vested as of the Effective Time shall fully vest and shall be treated
hereunder as one (1) share of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 (e) From and after the Effective Time, all Common Shares, all Preferred
Shares, and all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired, or converted in accordance with this
Section 3.1, as the case may be, and each holder of a certificate representing
any such Common Share, Preferred Share or Company Option shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the
consideration provided herein, if any.

SECTION 3.2 Closing Estimates. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer for its review and comment
(i) a statement setting forth (A) its estimate of the Net Working Capital as
of 12:01:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"), and (B) its estimate of Cash as of 12:01:01 a.m. (Eastern
Time) on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Cash"); (ii) its estimate of the
Transaction Expenses, as set forth in the Transaction Expenses Annex (the
"Estimated Transaction Expenses"); (iii) its estimate of the Closing
Indebtedness, including the Defeasance Costs and the Debt Repayment Expenses,
as set forth in the Closing Indebtedness Annex (the "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness"); and (iv) its estimate of the Severance Amount (the "Estimated
Severance Amount"). The amount of Aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid at
Closing shall be determined on the basis of the estimated amounts provided
pursuant to this Section 3.2 as modified by any comments provided by Buyer
pursuant to its review under this Section 3.2 no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date and reasonably acceptable to the Company.

SECTION 3.3 Adjustment Amount.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within sixty (60) days thereafter, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Stockholders' Representative a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth Buyer's calculation of (i) Cash as of 12:01:01 a.m.
(Eastern Time) on the Closing Date (the "Closing Cash"), (ii) Net Working
Capital as of 12:01:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Working
Capital"), (iii) the Transaction Expenses (the "Closing Transaction
Expenses"), (iv) the Closing Indebtedness, including the Defeasance Costs and
the Debt Repayment Expenses (the "Adjusted Closing Indebtedness"), and (v) the
Severance Amount (the "Closing Severance Amount") in each case along with
supporting detail to evidence the calculations of such amounts. The Closing
Statement and the calculations set forth therein shall be prepared in
accordance with the Company Accounting Policies and the definitions herein.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the sole purpose of the
determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing Severance Amount and the Adjusted
Closing Indebtedness is to determine the amount, if any, of the purchase price
adjustment contemplated by this Section 3.3 so as to reflect, respectively,
the differences, if any, between the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Closing Net Working Capital, the Estimated Cash and the Closing Cash, the
Estimated Transaction Expenses and the Closing Transaction Expenses, the
Estimated Severance Amount and the Closing Severance Amount, and the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness and the Adjusted Closing Indebtedness.

(b) After the delivery of the Closing Statement by Buyer, Buyer shall provide
to the Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives any information
they may reasonably request and access at all reasonable times during normal
business hours to the personnel, properties,

 working papers (subject to requirements of the applicable auditors), books and
records of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries in order to review the
Closing Statement. Following the Closing, neither Buyer nor the Surviving
Company shall take any action with respect to the accounting books, records,
policies or procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the specific
intent of affecting the components of the Closing Statement or impeding or
delaying the preparation thereof in the manner and utilizing the methods
required by this Agreement.

(c) Disputes.

(i) Unless the Stockholders' Representative notifies Buyer in writing within
forty five (45) days after Buyer's delivery of the Closing Statement, and the
supporting detail with respect thereto, of any objection to the computations
set forth in the Closing Statement (the "Notice of Objection"), the Closing
Statement and the calculations set forth therein shall be final and binding
for all purposes hereunder. Any Notice of Objection shall, in reasonable
detail, specify the basis for the objections set forth therein and shall
include the Stockholders' Representative's calculation of any amounts that are
disputed by such Notice of Objection (the "Disputed Amounts") to the extent
that such amounts may be determined. The Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Cash, the Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing Severance Amount
and the Adjusted Closing Indebtedness shall be final and binding for all
purposes hereunder unless the Stockholders' Representative provides a Notice
of Objection within such 45-day period objecting to the computation of any of
the foregoing amounts (it being understood that an objection to one or more of
the foregoing amounts shall not prevent any other amount from becoming final
and binding for all purposes hereunder).

(ii) If the Stockholders' Representative provides such Notice of Objection to
Buyer within such 45-day period, Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative
shall, during the 30-day period following the Stockholders' Representative's
delivery of such Notice of Objection to Buyer, attempt in good faith to
resolve any Disputed Amounts. If Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative
are unable to resolve all such Disputed Amounts within such period, the
matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted to the dispute resolution
group of Deloitte and Touche LLP (or, if such firm declines to act, to another
nationally recognized public accounting or financial consulting firm mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative) (such firm being
referred to herein as the "Independent Accountant"). The parties shall
instruct the Independent Accountant to render its decision within sixty (60)
days of its selection. The Independent Accountant shall only resolve the
Disputed Amounts by choosing the amounts submitted by either Buyer or the
Stockholders' Representative or amounts in between. The Surviving Company and
the Stockholders' Representative shall each furnish to the Independent
Accountant such work papers (subject to requirements of the applicable
auditors) and other documents and information relating to the Disputed Amounts
as the Independent Accountant may reasonably request. The resolution of the
Disputed Amounts by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding, and
the determination of the Independent Accountant shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. After final determination

 of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Severance Amount and the Adjusted Closing Indebtedness,
the Stockholders' Representative shall have no further right to make any
claims in respect of any element of the foregoing amounts that the
Stockholders' Representative raised in the Notice of Objection.

(iii) The date on which the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the
Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing Severance Amount and the Adjusted
Closing Indebtedness are finally determined in accordance with this Section
3.3(c) is hereinafter referred as to the "Determination Date." Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the resolution of the Disputed Amounts; provided,
that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated
between Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative in the same proportion that
the total amount of the Disputed Amounts submitted to the Independent
Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of the
Disputed Amounts so submitted by each such party.

(d) "Adjustment Amount" (positive or negative) means (i) the sum of (A) the
Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3(c),
(B) the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3(c), (C) the
Closing Severance Amount as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3(c), (D)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, and (E) the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, minus (ii) the sum of (V) the Estimated Net Working Capital, (W)
the Estimated Cash, (X) the Estimated Severance Amount, (Y) the Closing
Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3(c), and (Z)
the Adjusted Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to Section
3.3(c). If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, within five (5)
Business Days following the Determination Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause
its Affiliate to, deliver by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account, in the name of the Paying Agent, designated in writing by the
Stockholders' Representative, an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount. Upon
receipt of the Adjustment Amount, the Stockholders' Representative shall
direct the Paying Agent to, (i) with respect to amounts payable to the
Preferred Stockholders, pay such amounts pro rata to the Preferred
Stockholders and (ii) with respect to amounts payable to Change of Control
Bonus Recipients, release such amounts to the Surviving Company for payment
thereof by the Surviving Company as soon as practicable (but no later than one
payroll cycle) after receipt thereof pro rata to the Change of Control Bonus
Recipients, in each case (clauses (i) and (ii)), in accordance with the
Capital Structure Certificate, Change of Control Bonus Annex and less any
applicable withholding taxes and without interest. If the Adjustment Amount is
a negative number, then, within five Business Days following the Determination
Date, such Adjustment Amount shall be distributed, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, by the Escrow Agent from the Adjustment Fund and
the Indemnification Fund, if applicable, to an account designated in writing
by Buyer in accordance with Section 3.8(b). The amount of any Adjustment
Amount paid pursuant to this Section 3.3(d) shall be deemed an adjustment to
the Aggregate Merger Consideration for all purposes including for purposes of
the final consideration payable per Preferred Share hereunder.

 SECTION 3.4 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Common Shares and Preferred Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who
shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 3.1, if any. Such holders shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the consideration specified in
Section 3.1, if any (as adjusted, if applicable), without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.5, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.
The Company shall serve prompt notice to Buyer of any demands for appraisal of
any Common Shares of Preferred Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instrument served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by
the Company, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 3.5 Exchange Procedures.

(a) No later than five Business Days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause to be mailed at the address set forth opposite such holder's name on the
Capital Structure Certificate, or otherwise made available, to each holder of
certificates (the "Certificates") formerly evidencing Common Shares or
Preferred Shares a form of the Letter of Transmittal. After the Effective
Time, each holder of Certificates representing Preferred Shares, within one
(1) Business Day following the surrender of such Certificates to the Paying
Agent, together with the completed Letter of Transmittal, shall be entitled to
receive from the Paying Agent, in exchange therefor, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by such holder in the
Letter of Transmittal, the aggregate consideration for such Preferred Shares
in cash as contemplated by Section 3.1(c)(i), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall be cancelled. After the Effective Time, each Certificate
representing Common Shares surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.5 and
the relevant Letter of Transmittal shall be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.5 (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the aggregate
consideration for such Common Shares or Preferred Shares in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement, if any, without interest thereon.

(b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Preferred Shares that is
not registered in the transfer books of the Company, subject to any applicable
deductions or withholdings as described in Section 3.10, payment may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any

 Certificate shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact and an undertaking of indemnity by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable amount as
the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim, the Surviving
Company will issue (or cause to be issued) in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) At any time following the expiration of 12 months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall, in its reasonable discretion, be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed to the Preferred Stockholders, and
such funds shall thereafter become the property of the Surviving Company. Such
funds may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving Company and
shall be free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person. Thereafter,
such holders of Certificates representing Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
look to the Surviving Company (subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable consideration payable as contemplated by this Agreement (net of any
amounts that would be subject to withholding) upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Any portion of such remaining cash
unclaimed by the Preferred Stockholders as of a date that is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the Effective Time, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfer in the transfer books
of the Surviving Company of the Common Shares, Preferred Shares or Company
Options, as the case may be, that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.5.

SECTION 3.6 Payments at Closing. At the Closing, on behalf of the Surviving
Company, Buyer will make (or cause to be made) the following payments:

(i) to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the Stockholders' Representative in
writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an
amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration;

(ii) to the payroll account of the Surviving Company and for the benefit of
the Change of Control Bonus Recipients, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the Closing Aggregate Change of Control
Bonus Distribution, which the Surviving Company will disburse through a
special payroll on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter to
each Change of Control Bonus Recipient, as appropriate, in accordance with the
amounts set forth the Change of Control Bonus Annex less applicable
withholding Taxes, subject to such Change of Control Bonus Recipient executing
and

 returning a Change of Control Bonus Recipient Letter, in the form attached as
Exhibit A (the "Change of Control Bonus Recipient Letter");

(iii) to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the Stockholders' Representative in
writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an
amount equal to the Escrow Amount;

(iv) to the Stockholders' Representative, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Stockholders'
Representative in writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, an amount equal to the Stockholders' Expense Amount;

(v) on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated by the Stockholders' Representative in
writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an
amount in the aggregate equal to the portion of the Transaction Expenses to be
paid on behalf of the Company on the Closing Date at its direction, which
amount shall be distributed on the Closing Date in accordance with the
Transaction Expenses Annex;

(vi) immediately following the consummation of the Merger, on behalf of the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the payoff letters obtained in respect of the Repaid
Closing Indebtedness, or as otherwise designated by the Stockholders'
Representative in writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, an amount in the aggregate equal to the Repaid Closing
Indebtedness; and

(vii) To NewCo LLC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the Stockholders' Representative in writing
no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal
to the NewCo LLC Amount.

SECTION 3.7 Payment Annexes; Capital Structure Certificate.

(a) Closing Indebtedness. The Company shall prepare a schedule setting forth
an itemized list of the Closing Indebtedness, including the Defeasance Costs
and the Debt Repayment Expenses (the "Closing Indebtedness Annex"), in a
manner consistent with Annex 2 attached hereto.

(b) Transaction Expenses. The Company shall prepare a schedule setting forth
an itemized list of any and all Transaction Expenses (the "Transaction
Expenses Annex"), in a manner consistent with Annex 3 attached hereto.

(c) Closing Aggregate Change of Control Bonus Distribution. The Company shall
prepare a schedule setting forth the Closing Aggregate Change of Control Bonus
Distribution, together with an itemized list of all Change of Control Bonus
Agreements and Change of Control Bonus Recipients and, with respect to each
such Person, the portion of the Closing Aggregate Change

 of Control Bonus Distribution he or she is to be paid (the "Change of Control
Bonus Annex"), in a manner consistent with Annex 4 attached hereto.

(d) Delivery of Payment Annexes and Capital Structure Certificate. Each of the
Closing Indebtedness Annex, the Transaction Expenses Annex, Change of Control
Bonus Annex and the Capital Structure Certificate shall be prepared by the
Company in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative, and each shall be delivered to Buyer at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 3.8 Escrow Amount .

(a) The Escrow Amount deposited with Citibank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent")
pursuant to Section 3.6(iii) (such amount plus all accumulated earnings
thereon, the "Escrow Fund"), is to be governed in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the escrow agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"), among Buyer, the Escrow Agent
and the Stockholders' Representative.

(b) The Escrow Fund shall initially consist of a $5,000,000 portion (together
with the accumulated earnings thereon, the "Adjustment Fund"), a $675,000
portion (together with the accumulated earnings thereon, the "Indemnification
Fund"), and a $500,000 portion (together with the accumulated earnings
thereon, the "Specified Withdrawal Fund") and shall be used to satisfy any
amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, including the payment of the
Adjustment Amount, if any, pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any indemnification
amounts owed hereunder. In the event an Adjustment Amount determined pursuant
to Section 3.3(d) is owing to Buyer (such amount, which shall equal zero if no
amount is owing to Buyer, the "Adjustment Release Amount"), Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall promptly and jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute to Buyer the Adjustment Release Amount from the Adjustment
Fund and, if the Adjustment Release Amount is greater than the amount of the
Adjustment Fund, then from the Indemnification Fund until the Adjustment
Amount is satisfied. To the extent that the Adjustment Release Amount
distributed to Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence is less than the
amount of the Adjustment Fund, including if no Adjustment Release Amount is
disbursed, Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly and
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute an amount equal to the
difference thereof, or, if no Adjustment Release Amount is disbursed, the
entire amount of the Adjustment Fund, to the Paying Agent for payment thereof
by the Paying Agent pro rata to the Preferred Stockholders as set forth in the
applicable instructions and in accordance with the Capital Structure
Certificate less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest. Buyer
and the Stockholders' Representative shall timely provide such joint
instructions so that distributions can be made by the Escrow Agent within the
time period required by Section 3.3(d).

(c) The portion of the Escrow Fund that is not used to satisfy any other
amounts owing to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, including indemnification
amounts, or not subject to any claims hereunder, shall be released on the date
that is one (1) Business Day after the close of business on the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date to the Paying Agent for payment thereof by the
Paying Agent pro rata to the Preferred Stockholders as set forth in written
instructions provided by the Stockholders' Representative and in accordance
with the Capital Structure Certificate and less any applicable withholding
taxes and without interest; provided, that if there are any claims

 hereunder that are properly pending on such date, the applicable portion of
the Escrow Fund that is subject to any such claims shall not be released to or
as instructed by the Stockholders' Representative until such applicable claims
are finally resolved and satisfied pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Upon the final release of all the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agreement
shall terminate. All funds so released from the Escrow Fund shall be
distributed in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 3.8(c).

(d) The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund for the potential recipients
thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and shall not be subject to
any Lien, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

SECTION 3.9 Stockholders' Expense Amount. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit
cash in an amount equal to the Stockholders' Expense Amount into an account
designated by the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders' Expense
Amount shall be used to fund any expenses incurred by the Stockholders'
Representative in the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder. The
Stockholders' Expense Amount will be held by the Stockholders' Representative
until such time as the Stockholders' Representative determines, in its sole
discretion, that the Stockholders, Option Holders, and Change of Control Bonus
Recipients shall have no further expenses to be incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any portion of the
Stockholders' Expense Amount remaining after such date shall be paid by the
Stockholders' Representative to, the Paying Agent for payment thereof by the
Paying Agent pro rata to the Preferred Stockholders, as set forth in written
instructions provided by the Stockholders' Representative and in accordance
with the Capital Structure Certificate, Change of Control Bonus Annex and less
any applicable withholding taxes and without interest.

SECTION 3.10 Withholding Taxes. The Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and
Buyer shall make any payment pursuant to this Agreement free and clear of any
deduction or withholding Tax unless otherwise required under any provision of
applicable Law. The Surviving Company, the Paying Agent and Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this
agreement such amounts that the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or the
Buyer, respectively, determines are required to be deducted and withheld under
any provision of applicable Law; provided, however, that the parties to any
such amounts payable shall use commercially reasonably efforts to inform one
another of such withholding obligation and to provide forms or other evidence
that would exempt such amounts payable from, or reduce or minimize any such,
deduction or withholding under applicable Law. The Surviving Company, the
Paying Agent and Buyer shall withhold or deduct with respect to amounts
payable to Change of Control Bonus Recipients such amounts as the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent or Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Law
and timely remit such amounts to the appropriate Tax Authority. To the extent
that any amounts are withheld by the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or
Buyer in accordance with this Section 3.10, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or Buyer, as the case may
be.

 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company prior
to, or concurrently with, the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure
Schedule" or the "Schedules"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Buyer and Merger Sub as follows:

SECTION 4.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary because of the property
owned, leased or operated by it or because of the nature of its business as
now being conducted, except for any failure to so qualify or be in good
standing that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule lists the jurisdictions of organization and qualifications
to do business (or the foreign equivalents, if any) of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available to Buyer complete and correct
copies of the constitutive documents of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 4.2 Authority; Approvals.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby are within its
corporate power and have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company (other than the approval of the
Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Company's stockholders
and the filing of a Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Stockholders' Representative) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditor's rights generally and by the application of
general principles of equity.

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) declared the Merger to be advisable, and
(iii) resolved to recommend that the Company's stockholders adopt this
Agreement, and none of the aforesaid actions by the Board of Directors of the
Company has been amended, rescinded or modified.

(c) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding Common
Shares to adopt this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of the Company's equity interests necessary to approve the Merger (the
"Requisite Stockholder Approval").

SECTION 4.3 Capitalization; Equity Interests.

 (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 250,000 shares of Preferred Stock, of which 118,319.72
shares (excluding shares of Preferred Stock that are issuable as accrued but
unpaid dividends thereon) are issued and outstanding, and (ii) 250,000 shares
of Common Stock, of which 118,529.13 shares (including 1,500 shares of
Restricted Stock) are issued and outstanding. Section 4.3(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, the record ownership of
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock and any declared
and accrued, but unpaid, dividends thereon, which constitutes all issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. Section 4.3(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list, as of the date of
this Agreement, of each outstanding Company Option, including the holder, the
date of grant and the exercise price thereof.

(b) Section 4.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each of the Company's
Subsidiaries' authorized capital stock and the number of shares of capital
stock issued and outstanding (or, if such Subsidiary is not a corporation, the
number of issued and outstanding voting securities of such Subsidiary or other
ownership interests therein). Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have any Subsidiaries or own or hold
any equity interest or other security in any other Person. Except as set forth
in Section 4.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, all issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests
in, the Company's Subsidiaries are directly or indirectly owned beneficially
and of record by the Company, free and clear of all Liens, and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, other voting securities
or ownership interests).

(c) Except for the Company Equity Plan, the Change of Control Bonus Agreements
and the Change of Control Bonus Plan, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company has adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or
any other plan or agreement providing for equity or equity-related
compensation to any Person (whether payable in shares, cash or otherwise), in
each case that remains in effect as of the date hereof. The Company has
reserved 50,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to employees and directors
of, and consultants to, the Company upon the issuance of stock or the exercise
of options or the granting or purchase of restricted stock or the granting of
restricted stock units granted under the Company Equity Plan, of which (i)
1,248 shares are issuable, as of the date hereof, upon the exercise of
outstanding, unexercised options granted under the Company Equity Plan, and
(ii) 48,752 shares remain available for future grant. Each Company Option was
originally granted with an exercise price that the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith, based on a reasonable valuation method utilized at the
time of grant, determined to be at least equal to the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock on the date of grant. True and complete copies of all
agreements issued under the Company Equity Plan have been made available to
Buyer, along with any amendments thereto, and except for this Agreement, there
are no agreements to amend, modify or supplement such agreements from the
forms thereof made available to Buyer. No holder of Company Options has the
ability to early exercise any Company Options for shares of Restricted Stock
under the Company Equity Plan or any other contract or agreement relating to
such Company Options. All holders of Company Options are current or former
employees or non-employee directors of the Company, or their respective heirs,

substantially all the employees with respect to whom the Company and each
Subsidiary has an obligation to contribute to such Multiemployer Plan perform

(m) or (o) of Code Section 414 with any Person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company or ERISA

respect to any insurance policy providing funding or reimbursement for
benefits under any Plan (excluding any Multiemployer Plan), to the knowledge
of the Company, no insurance company issuing any such policy is in
receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding.

 (m) Within the last three (3) years (a) no actions, suits or claims (other

payable under any Plan (excluding any Multiemployer Plan), (iii) result in the
acceleration of time of payment or vesting of any such benefits to any

estimate of withdrawal liability, as set forth under Section 4.14(g) above, if
the Company or a Subsidiary incurred a complete withdrawal from each such plan
as of the assumed withdrawal date used in such communication, the aggregate
amount of withdrawal liability that would be assessed by all such
Multiemployer Plans to the Company and each Subsidiary would be, based on such
communications, $17,060,582.

(ii) For Multiemployer Plans that have not provided an estimate of withdrawal
liability as set forth under Section 4.14(g) above, if the Company or a

Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing), Buyer will have available to it at the relevant times
hereunder sufficient unrestricted cash on hand necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Commitment Letter and to perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder, including (a) all payments to be
made pursuant to Section 3.6 and (b) all of the out-of-pocket costs of Buyer
arising from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which are necessary to be paid in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The obligations to fund the commitments
under the Commitment Letter are not subject to any condition, other than the
conditions expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter
has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer,
each other Person party thereto, and the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect as of the date hereof and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, each other Person party
thereto, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application
relating to or affecting rights of creditors. As of the date hereof, (i) the
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, (ii) to the knowledge of
the Buyer, no such amendment or modification is contemplated or the subject of
current discussions, and (iii) the commitments contained in the Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. There are no fees,
expense reimbursement obligations or other amounts that are required to be
paid by Buyer prior to Closing under or in respect of the Commitment Letter
which have not been paid. As of the date hereof, (x) no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach under
the Commitment Letter and (y) Buyer does not have any reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied on the Closing
Date or that the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter will not be made available on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary,
but subject to the limitations of Section 12.9(b), Buyer affirms, represents
and warrants that (A) it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its
obligations under this Agreement that it obtain financing for or related to
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement are not contingent in any respect upon the funding
of the amounts contemplated to be funded pursuant to the Commitment Letter and
(C) the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement are not subject

 to any conditions regarding Buyer's, its Affiliates', or any other Person's
ability to obtain financing for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5.7 Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any financings related thereto),
Buyer and the Surviving Company shall on a consolidated basis, be able to pay
their respective debts as they become absolute and matured in the ordinary
course and shall own property on a consolidated and going concern basis having
a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their
respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any financings related thereto),
Buyer and the Surviving Company shall on a consolidated and going concern
basis have adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No
transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company.

SECTION 5.8 Tax Matters. Buyer and its Subsidiaries have been filing a
consolidated federal income tax return pursuant to Section 1502 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and after the Closing
Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will join in the filing of the
consolidated federal income tax return that includes Buyer.

consistent with past practice and (ii) the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to:

Section 6.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of Buyer

waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if such election,

or any of its Subsidiaries, reducing the availability of any Tax attribute of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than utilizing such Tax
attributes in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required
by applicable Law), or otherwise adversely impacting the Buyer, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period or (iii) take or agree

SECTION 6.2 Access and Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Closing, and (ii) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article XI, the Company shall (x) allow
Buyer and its Representatives to make such reasonable investigation of the

Subsidiaries and the properties, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (y) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such
financial, operating and other data and information and copies of documents
with respect to the Company or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as Buyer shall from time to time reasonably request. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.2(a), the foregoing shall (a) be
permitted only to the extent reasonably necessary to enable Buyer to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) not apply with

 respect to any information the disclosure of which would, based on the advice
of the Company's outside counsel, waive any privilege or breach any duty of

respect to any document or information regarding the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' entry into or conducting of a competitive sale process prior to

properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except with the Company's prior
written consent (e) not apply to such portions of documents or information
relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange
of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by the
Company's outside counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties
between the Company and its Subsidiaries and Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates and (f) not apply with respect to any document or information the
disclosure of which would be in violation of applicable Laws of any
Governmental Entity or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub shall, prior
to the Closing Date, have any contact whatsoever with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, with any partner, lender, lessor, vendor, customer, supplier,
employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
consultation with the Company and then only with the express prior approval of
the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(b) All access and investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be
coordinated through the Company's Chief Financial Officer, shall occur only
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours and shall be conducted
at Buyer's expense and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal
operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall be
subject to existing confidentiality obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and applicable Law.

SECTION 6.3 Stockholder Consent and Notice. Promptly following the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall solicit the Stockholder Written Consent
from all of its Stockholders entitled to vote thereon. The Company shall
promptly deliver to Buyer a copy of each executed Stockholder Written Consent
upon receipt thereof from any Stockholder pursuant to such solicitation. It is
anticipated that, promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company
will receive Stockholder Written Consents from Stockholders pursuant to the
preceding solicitation that are sufficient to fully and irrevocably deliver
the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Upon receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall promptly deliver a written notice (the
"Stockholder Notice") to each Stockholder whose consent was not obtained prior
to the Company's receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, which notice
shall include the notice to stockholders required by Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law of the approval of the Merger and that
appraisal rights are available. Buyer shall have a right to review and comment
upon the Stockholder Notice prior to any delivery of the Stockholder Notice to
any Stockholders, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments
made by Buyer on the Stockholder Notice prior to the delivery thereof to any
Stockholders.

SECTION 6.4 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances.

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto will use all reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable (including making any requisite filings or
giving any requisite notices) under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
practicable and to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VIII are
satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control of any of them.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 6.2,
the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
shall each furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing.

(b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties to
this Agreement shall take or cause to be taken all such necessary action,
including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents, as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto for such
purposes or otherwise to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

SECTION 6.5 Public Announcements. The parties hereto will not, and will cause
each of their Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party
hereto may, without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue or
cause the publication of any such press release or other public announcement
to the extent that such party reasonably determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that such action is required by applicable Law or by
the rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization, in which event such
party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other parties
hereto reasonable time to comment on such press release or other public
announcement in advance of its issuance or publication.

SECTION 6.6 Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company or its successor to, fulfill and honor
in all respects the obligations of the Company with respect to all rights to
indemnification (including advancement of expenses) or exculpation existing in
favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, any Person who is
now, or has been at anytime prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director, officer or fiduciary of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Parties") under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or in any indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date hereof and set forth in Section 6.6 of the Disclosure
Schedule (copies of which have been made available to Buyer) to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain, maintain and fully
pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming all Persons who were
directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit

 rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors'
and officers' liability insurance and related coverages that are under the
same policy in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date; provided that the cost of the annual premium for such "tail"
insurance policies shall not be required to exceed an amount equal to 300% of
the annual premiums currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for
such insurance; provided, further, that, if such amount is insufficient for
such coverage, the Company may spend up to such amount to obtain "tail"
insurance policies with the greatest coverage available at such cost. Buyer
shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, cancel or
change such insurance policies in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Company Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.6 applies without the prior
written consent of such Company Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt,
the costs of such insurance policies shall constitute Transaction Expenses.

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 6.6 applies without the consent of such affected Company
Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 6.6 (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.6.

SECTION 6.7 Section 280G. To the extent that any individual who is a
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) may
receive any payment or benefit in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that individually or in the aggregate could be
characterized as a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of
the Code), then no later than three (3) calendar days prior to the Closing,
the Company shall obtain a written waiver from each such individual, pursuant
to which the individual shall have waived his or her rights to some or all of
such payments and benefits so that all remaining such payments and benefits
applicable to such individual shall not constitute "parachute payments" (such
waived payments and benefits, the "Waived 280G Benefits"), provided, however
that at least three (3) calendar days prior to such deadline, Buyer shall have
provided to the Company sufficient information regarding any payments or
benefits offered by Buyer to such individual that could be so characterized as
"parachute payments." Promptly following the execution of such waivers, and in
any event at least one (1) calendar day prior to the Closing, the Company
shall solicit a vote of the Waived 280G Benefits from the stockholders of the
Company in the manner provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and its
associated Treasury Regulations. Prior to soliciting such waivers and vote,
the Company shall provide a draft of such waivers and such stockholder vote
solicitation materials (together with any calculations) to Buyer for Buyer's
review and comment, and the Company shall consider in good faith Buyer's
comments thereto submitted before such

 waivers and vote are required to be provided to the applicable Persons. To the
extent that any of the Waived 280G Benefits are not approved by the
stockholders of the Company as contemplated above, prior to the Closing, such
Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided in any manner, except to
the extent that such Waived 280G Benefits constitute reasonable compensation
for personal services to be rendered after the Closing. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence that a vote of the stockholders of
the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.7 and that either (A) the requisite number of votes was obtained
with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the "280G Approval"), or (B) the
280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G
Benefits shall not be made or provided.

SECTION 6.8 Post-Closing Record Retention and Access. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall provide the Stockholders' Representative and its
authorized representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of
examining and copying), during normal business hours, to any books and records
and other materials in the possession of the Company relating to the
preparation of Tax Returns, to verify any item or information relevant
pursuant to this Agreement (and any materials necessary for the preparation of
any of the foregoing). Buyer shall not and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, for a period of seven years following the Closing Date,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any such books and records and other
materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any portions thereof,
relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering to
surrender to the Stockholders' Representative such books and records and other
materials or such portions thereof.

SECTION 6.9 Notices and Consents. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (a)
give (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to give) any required notices to third
parties triggered as a result of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts (and will
cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts) to obtain any
third party consents triggered as a result of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case of clauses (a) and (b) that
Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the matters referred to in
Section 4.4; provided, however, that nothing in Section 6.4(a) or this Section
6.9 shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to (i) expend any money to
obtain any such consent or to remedy any breach of any representation or
warranty hereunder, (ii) commence any action, suit or proceeding or (iii)
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

SECTION 6.10 Expenses. Each party hereto shall bear its own fees, costs and
expenses incurred in the pursuit of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the fees and expenses of its respective counsel,
financial advisors and accountants; provided that Buyer shall pay, or cause to
be paid, (i) all Transaction Expenses as provided in Section 3.6 and (ii) all
Debt Repayment Expenses that are part of the Repaid Closing Indebtedness as
provided in Section 3.6, and (iii) all fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow
Agent and the Paying Agent (collectively, the "Agents' Fees"); and provided,
further, that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant, if any,
shall be allocated as provided in Section 3.3.

SECTION 6.11 Employees and Employee Benefits. During the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall
provide employees of the Surviving Company and its Affiliates who were
employees of the Company and

 its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing and who continue employment
with the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date with (i)
annual rates of base salary or hourly wages, as applicable, and annual target
cash incentive opportunities that are no less than the annual rates of base
salary or hourly wages and annual target cash incentive opportunities provided
to such employees immediately before the Closing; and (ii) coverage and
benefits pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the
benefits provided to such employees under the Plans (excluding any
Multiemployer Plan) as in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Where
applicable, each such employee shall receive full credit for service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (excluding equity-based compensation vesting) under
each employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement to be provided by
Buyer or the Surviving Company to such employee (excluding equity-based
compensation) and for purposes of accruing vacation and other paid time off
benefits to the same extent such service was recognized under the applicable
Plan (excluding any Multiemployer Plan) immediately prior to the Closing. To
the extent any such employee has satisfied any deductible or co-payments under
the Plans that are group health plans for the Plan year in which the Closing
occurs, Buyer or the Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable
measures to provide such employee with credit for such payment under the group
health plans of Buyer or the Surviving Company that most closely resembles the
group health Plan under which the deductible or co-payment was satisfied.
Nothing in this Agreement (i) requires the Buyer or the Surviving Company and
its Affiliates to continue the employment of any employee following the
Closing, or (ii) constitutes a benefit plan or an amendment to a benefit plan.

SECTION 6.12 Omitted.

SECTION 6.13 No Solicitations. The Company will not, and will not permit any
of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, engage in,
respond to, or encourage, discussions or negotiations with any Person (whether
such discussions or negotiations are initiated by them or otherwise), or
solicit or encourage proposals from any Person, other than Buyer and its
advisors and representatives, with respect to (i) any purchase, sale or other
disposition of any material portion of the assets of the Company (other than
sales of assets in the ordinary course of business otherwise permissible under
Section 6.1), (ii) any issuance, sale or other disposition of any equity
interests in the Company, (iii) any merger, acquisition, consolidation or
similar business combination transaction involving the Company, or (iv) any
recapitalization of the Company (each of the foregoing being defined as an
"Acquisition Transaction"); (b) provide any information with respect to the
Company to any person or entity, other than Buyer and its advisors and
representatives, in connection with an Acquisition Transaction; or (c) enter
into any agreement (whether or not binding or definitive) with any Person,
other than Buyer and its advisors and representatives, concerning or relating
to an Acquisition Transaction. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than Buyer and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction. The Company agrees not to (and to cause its
Subsidiaries not to) release any third party from the confidentiality
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party.

 SECTION 6.14 Payoff Letters. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, payoff letters in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and its
Commitment Parties and their Representatives from the holders (or the agents
for such holders) of the Closing Indebtedness set forth on Annex 5 attached
hereto (collectively, the "Repaid Closing Indebtedness"), and all documents
related thereto, including any credit agreements, pledge agreements, security
agreements, notes and guarantees, and all Liens securing the Repaid Closing
Indebtedness, shall be released or terminated upon the repayment of the Repaid
Closing Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of such payoff letters and
any possessory collateral securing any Repaid Closing Indebtedness shall be
delivered to Buyer, its Commitment Parties or their respective designees, as
directed by Buyer.

SECTION 6.15 Financing.

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter and to consummate the Financing on the
Closing Date, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the commitment for the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter,
(ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" terms and
conditions to which the Commitment Letter is subject), (iii) satisfy (and
cause each of its Affiliates to satisfy), or if deemed advisable by Buyer
obtain the waiver of, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in the Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements
related thereto (including payment of all fees and expenses) and comply with
its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letter in the event of any breach or purported breach thereof (other than
through the commencement of litigation). In the event that all conditions to
the commitment of any counterparty to the Commitment Letter providing the
Financing (other than conditions that are within the control of Buyer,
including conditions relating to (1) the failure of any equity funding
condition in the Commitment Letter, (2) the failure by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to deliver documents at the Closing, (3) the failure to pay costs,
fees, expenses or other compensation contemplated by the Commitment Letter or
related letters which are payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to the
lead arrangers, other lenders and administrative agents or any other Person or
(4) any breach, in any material respect, by Buyer, or any of its Affiliates
under the Commitment Letter or related letters) have been satisfied, unless
Buyer has obtained an equivalent amount of funds (to be applied to the same
uses) from an alternate source of financing in lieu of the Financing Sources
in one or more transactions that would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
Sources, and each other Person providing such Financing, to fund when required
hereunder the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to take or refrain
from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter or in any definitive agreements related thereto.

(b) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including
any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace the Commitment Letter if such
amendment, modification, waiver or voluntary

 replacement (i) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to
the consummation of the Financing as compared to those in the Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) adversely affects in
any material respect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the
Financing, (iii) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing, unless other
financing is increased by a corresponding amount (or Buyer or its Affiliates
may draw upon an available revolving credit facility to fund an amount equal
to such reduction; provided that such draw would not impair any availability
required to fund the maximum amount of market flex that might be imposed), or
(iv) could otherwise be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
terms and conditions to which the Commitment Letter is subject), or Buyer
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to make any portion of the Financing unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" terms and
conditions to which the Commitment Letter is subject), regardless of the
reason therefor, then Buyer shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources, in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
pay related fees and expenses, with terms and conditions (including "market
flex" terms and conditions) not materially less favorable to Buyer than the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" terms and conditions to which the Commitment Letter is subject),
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, but in no
event later than the date on which Buyer is required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement,
and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason
therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as permitted to be
amended, modified or replaced by this Section 6.15(c), and references to the
"Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 6.15(c).

(d) Buyer shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing.
Buyer shall give the Company prompt written and electronic notice of any
knowledge of (i) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or definitive documents
related to the Financing of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) the receipt of any
notice or other communication from any Financing Source or other Person
providing the Financing with respect to (A) any actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing (or any
statement by any such Person that such Person does not intend to enter into
any such document or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby) or
(B) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing and
(iii) the occurrence of any event or development that could reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the ability of Buyer to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated

 by the Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Financing

Subsidiaries (against the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) or any other Person) involving a
right or entitlement or an alleged right or entitlement to indemnification,
reimbursement of expenses or any other relief or remedy;

(g) any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement, and any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including any fees,
costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
against or settling any action or proceeding in respect of Dissenting Shares;
and

(h) any payment obligation in respect of a withdrawal liability assessment by
the Specified Plan with respect to a complete or partial withdrawal within the
meaning of ERISA Section 4203 or 4205 (as modified by ERISA Section
4208(d)(1), as applicable) that occurred prior to the Closing ("Specified
Withdrawal Losses").

 SECTION 9.2 Indemnification of Seller Indemnified Parties. From and following
the Closing, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder, the Stockholders' Representative
and their respective officers, managers, directors, partners and Affiliates
(the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against all Losses incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out of or resulting from (a) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement, or (b) any breach of any covenant of Buyer or Merger Sub prior
to the Closing or after the Closing, or of the Surviving Company after the
Closing, in each case contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If any party (the "Indemnified Party") receives written notice of the
commencement of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a
third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which a claim
for indemnification is sought under this Article IX (a "Third Party Claim")
the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the party or parties from which
indemnification is sought hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") (and, if Buyer,
with a copy to the Escrow Agent, the RandW Insurance Policy provider and the
Stockholders' Representative) with written notice of such Third Party Claim,
stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along
with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and
the basis for indemnification sought (it being understood that any claim for
indemnity under this Article IX must be made by written notice on or prior to
the close of business on the Indemnity Termination Date). Failure of the
Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from its indemnification obligations hereunder, except if and to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of a Third
Party Claim at its own expense and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, if (i) within thirty (30) days from
receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
intends to undertake such defense pursuant to its indemnification obligations
hereunder, (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is a party to the Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party has not determined in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict in interest, (iii)
such Third Party Claim does not seek equitable relief or an amount of damages
in excess of what would otherwise be recoverable by the Indemnified Party
under this Agreement, (iv) if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified
Party (A) the Third Party Claim, if resolved adversely, would not cause the
Buyer Indemnified Parties to lose coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy, as
determined by Buyer in good faith and with notice to the Stockholders'
Representative with detail supporting such determination and (B) the
Indemnified Party does not reasonably believe that the Indemnifying Party\'s
assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim would adversely affect the
business operations or commercial reputation of Buyer, the Surviving Company
or any of their respective Affiliates and (v) the Indemnifying Party
simultaneously agrees to fully indemnify the Indemnified Parties for such
matter (subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in this Article
IX). The Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to
employ separate counsel (who may be selected by the Indemnified Party in its
sole discretion) in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof,
and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably assist and cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such claim
or demand. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing

 reasonable access during normal business hours to information, records,
personnel and documents relating to such matters. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of
such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Party's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of
law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no material and adverse
effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and
(B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party (subject to the deductible amount set forth in Section
9.4(a)(i)). If, however, the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such claims may
be effected by the Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Party's consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply to Tax Proceedings
which shall be governed by Section 7.4.

(a) If an Indemnified Party shall have a claim to be indemnified by an
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send to the Indemnifying Party (and, if
Buyer, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, the RandW Insurance Policy provider and
the Stockholders' Representative) a written notice specifying the nature, the
amount thereof, to the extent known, and the basis for indemnification sought
which may be updated from time to time (it being understood that any claim for
indemnity under this Article IX must be made by written notice on or prior to
the close of business on the Indemnity Termination Date). The Indemnifying
Party will have forty five (45) days from receipt of any such notice to give
notice of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party does not give such notice of dispute, the Indemnified Party
will be deemed to be entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in the applicable notice. The Indemnified Party will reasonably
cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in making its determination as to
the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party by providing
reasonable access during normal business hours to information, records,
personnel and documents relating to such matters.

SECTION 9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to assert any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1 or Section
9.2, respectively, unless such claim is asserted by a written notice given by
such party in accordance with the terms hereof prior to the close of business
on the Indemnity Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary,

(i) other than with respect to Fundamental Representations, the
representations set forth in Section 4.14(g)(i) and Intentional Fraud, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any claim for
indemnification under Section 9.1(a) unless and until the aggregate liability
for Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds
$675,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent of such excess
(provided that, in calculating whether such amount has been exceeded, only
particular Losses under Section 9.1(a) involving items or matters arising out
of substantially similar facts and circumstances in excess of $15,000 shall be
considered), and

 (ii) other than with respect to Intentional Fraud, the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under
Section 9.2(a) unless and until the aggregate liability for Losses suffered by
the Seller Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds the Deductible, and then
only to the extent of such excess (provided that, in calculating whether such
amount has been exceeded, only particular Losses under Section 9.2(a)
involving items or matters arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances in excess of $15,000 shall be considered).

(b) No claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1 may be asserted with
respect to any Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties (and the
amount of any such Loss shall not be included in the calculation of any
limitations on indemnification set forth herein) resulting from amounts taken
into account in the determinations of or amounts included in the calculations
of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Transaction Expenses,
Closing Severance Amount or the Adjusted Closing Indebtedness, in each case,
as finally determined in accordance with Section 3.3(c). The amount of the
payment for any Losses that any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 9.1 shall be reduced to reflect any Tax Benefit actually
realized, in the year in which the indemnity payment is required to be made or
in any prior year, by Buyer, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Benefit" means any
deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance that
actually reduces in cash the amount of Tax that Buyer, the Surviving Company
or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company would have been required to pay (or
actually increases in cash the amount of Tax refund to which Buyer, the
Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company would have been
entitled) in the absence of the item giving rise to the indemnity claim. For
purposes of determining the amount of any payment due to the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 9.4(b), Buyer, the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Company shall be deemed to use all other
deductions, amortizations, exclusions from income or other allowances of the
Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company (to the extent
that such deductions, amortizations, exclusions from income or other
allowances are entitled to be used under applicable Tax law) prior to the use
of any Tax Benefits in respect of which Buyer is obligated to pay the
Indemnifying Party hereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to the
following sentence, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be indemnified hereunder
for any Losses related to (i) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax periods that are not Pre-
Closing Tax Periods or (ii) the amount or usability of any net operating loss,
capital loss, Tax basis, or other Tax asset. The foregoing shall not limit a
Buyer Indemnified Party's right to be indemnified under Section 9.1(c) for
Losses attributable to Taxes described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the
definition of Pre-Closing Taxes.

(d) To the extent required under applicable Law, the Indemnified Party shall
use reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses for which indemnification may be
claimed by such party pursuant to this Agreement upon and after becoming aware
of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
Losses.

(e) The amount of the payment for any Losses that any Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IX shall be reduced by any
related recoveries to which

 the Indemnified Party actually receives under applicable insurance policies
(other than pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy) or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible for any such Losses (net of any costs or expenses
incurred in obtaining such recoveries, including any resulting increases in
insurance premiums). If an Indemnified Party actually receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person in respect of
any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by an Indemnifying Party
in respect thereof, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse such
Indemnifying Party for any such previous payment made that has not otherwise
been reimbursed up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
unpaid or unreimbursed costs or expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount, including any resulting increases in insurance
premiums (provided that if such reimbursement is owed to a Seller Indemnified
Party, Buyer shall pay such amount to (i) with respect to amounts payable to
the Stockholders, the Paying Agent or the Stockholders' Representative for
payment thereof by the Paying Agent or the Stockholders' Representative, as
applicable, pro rata to the Stockholders and (ii) with respect to amounts
payable to Change of Control Bonus Recipients, the Surviving Company for
payment thereof by the Surviving Company as soon as practicable (but no later
than one payroll cycle) after receipt thereof pro rata to the Change of
Control Bonus Recipients, in each case (clauses (i) and (ii)), as set forth in
written instructions provided by the Stockholders' Representative and in
accordance with the Capital Structure Certificate, Change of Control Bonus
Annex and less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no party hereto
shall be liable to any other party hereto (including its respective heirs,
legal representatives, successors or assigns, as the case may be, hereunder)
for any punitive, special or exemplary damages, pursuant to this Article IX,
whether for breach of representation or warranty or of covenant or other
agreement or any obligation arising therefrom or otherwise, whether liability
is asserted in contract or tort (including negligence and strict product
liability) and regardless of whether such party has been advised of the
possibility of any such loss or damage; provided, that an Indemnified Party
may assert a claim for indemnification under this Article IX for any Losses
for punitive, special or exemplary damages, if such Indemnified Party is
required by an order, judgment, injunction, decree, ruling or award issued or
entered by any Governmental Entity to pay such damages to a third party. Each
party hereto hereby waives any claims that these exclusions deprive such party
of an adequate remedy.

(g) Following the Closing, except as expressly provided in Section 12.9 (but
subject to the limitations therein) or as provided for in a Transaction
Agreement against the party thereto and other than in the case of Intentional
Fraud, each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX (which (i) Losses
under Sections 9.1(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) may only be recovered from
first, the Indemnification Fund second, the RandW Insurance Policy, (ii) Losses
under Section 9.1(a) incurred prior to the Indemnity Termination Date may be
only recovered from first, the Indemnification Fund and second, under the RandW
Insurance Policy, and (iii) Losses under Section 9.1(a) with respect to
Fundamental Representations incurred after the Indemnity Termination Date may
be only be recovered from the RandW Insurance Policy) or the post-closing
adjustment provisions set forth in Section 3.3 (which, in the case of an
Adjustment Amount payable to Buyer, may only be recovered from the Adjustment
Fund and the Indemnification

 Fund in accordance with Section 3.8(b)). Without limiting anything in this
paragraph, and without limiting their rights pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of this Article IX, the Buyer Indemnified Parties expressly waive
any and all rights and remedies under any Environmental Laws including the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, similar
state statutes and common law in connection with any Losses relating to this
Agreement (including the Schedules and exhibits attached hereto and the
certificates delivered pursuant hereto) or the transactions contemplated
hereby. All rights, claims and causes of action that may be based upon, in
respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in
any manner to this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and are those solely of) the
parties hereto and thereto. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement or the Transaction Agreements or in the case of Intentional Fraud,
no Person who is not a party hereto or to the Transaction Agreements,
including any current, former or future representative or Affiliate of any
party hereto, or any current, former or future representative or Affiliate of
any of the foregoing (collectively, "Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising
under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement
or the Transaction Agreements or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or the Transaction Agreements or their negotiation, execution,
performance, or breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each
party hereto hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes
of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. The parties
hereto agree that the Nonparty Affiliates shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Section 9.4(g).

SECTION 9.5 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing solely for purposes of Sections 9.1 and 9.2 and shall terminate at the
close of business on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Indemnity Termination Date"), except for the Fundamental Representations
which shall survive until the close of business on the six (6) year
anniversary of the Closing Date (other than the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.13 (Tax Matters) which shall survive until the close of
business on the date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof)). The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms, except for the
obligations set forth in Sections 9.1(e), 9.1(f), and 9.1(g), which, in each
case, shall survive the Closing and terminate on the Indemnity Termination
Date. No party shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with
respect to any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the
termination thereof or otherwise after the applicable Indemnity Termination
Date, except (i) with respect to Intentional Fraud or (ii) with respect to a
claim for indemnification under this Article IX if written notice thereof has
been given in accordance with the provisions hereof by the Indemnified Party
to the Indemnifying Party prior to the close of business on the Indemnity
Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if such written notice has been given in accordance with the provisions hereof
and prior to the termination of the applicable representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, then the relevant representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall survive as to such claim until the claim has
been finally resolved.

 SECTION 9.6 Payment of Losses.

(a) No later than ten Business Days following the final determination of the
amount of any Losses payable to any Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with
this Article IX and subject to Section 9.8, Buyer and the Stockholders'
Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent in writing to release to
Buyer, from the Indemnification Fund, the lesser of (i) the amount of such
Losses and (ii) the then-remaining balance of the Indemnification Fund.

(b) No later than ten Business Days following the final determination of the
amount of any Losses payable to any Seller Indemnified Party in accordance
with this Article IX, Buyer shall pay to such Seller Indemnified Party, in
cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by such Seller Indemnified Party, the amount of such Losses.

SECTION 9.7 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. For all Tax purposes, the
parties hereto agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration unless a final determination
of a Tax Authority provides otherwise.

SECTION 9.8 RandW Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (a) all claims by Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses under
this Article IX, to the extent not satisfied by the Indemnification Fund and
to the extent covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, shall be asserted against
the RandW Insurance Policy and resolved in compliance with the procedures set
forth in the RandW Insurance Policy, and (b) Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy
for any Losses under Section 9.1, except with respect to Intentional Fraud,
shall be first, the Indemnification Fund, and second, the RandW Insurance
Policy, and Buyer shall be permitted to be indemnified only from the
Indemnification Fund for any amounts not acknowledged as covered and payable
under the RandW Insurance Policy by the insurer within the timeframe for such
acknowledgement set forth in the RandW Insurance Policy. Except as set forth in
this Section 9.8, the Stockholders and Option Holders shall have no
indemnification obligation to Buyer or Merger Sub with respect to Losses under
this Article IX. Any objections by the provider under the RandW Insurance Policy
for any indemnification claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party, as well as
the resolution of any disputes related thereto, shall also proceed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the RandW Insurance Policy. Buyer
agrees to pay the total premium and any related costs (including but not
limited to Taxes, underwriting fees and broker fees and commissions associated
with the RandW Insurance Policy) for the RandW Insurance Policy; provided,
however, fifty percent (50%) of such premium and related costs shall be deemed
Transaction Expenses and borne by the Company. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that the obtaining of the RandW Insurance Policy is not a condition to the
Closing and that Buyer's failure or inability to obtain the RandW Insurance
Policy shall not affect the Buyer's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereunder. In addition, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the obtaining of the RandW Insurance Policy shall not materially
impede or delay the Closing. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not
(and shall cause its Affiliates to not) amend the RandW Insurance Policy in a
manner which would materially prejudice the Stockholders and other Seller
Indemnified Parties without Stockholders' Representative's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided that the foregoing provision shall not be interpreted to

 in any way impair or diminish the right of Buyer or any other insured under
the RandW Insurance Policy to pursue and obtain recovery for any Loss under the
RandW Insurance Policy.

SECTION 9.9 No Duplication. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Transaction Agreements, it is intended that the provisions of
this Agreement will not result in any duplicative payment of any amount
required to be paid under this Agreement (and the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not be indemnified in respect of any amount to the extent such amount
can be shown by the Stockholders' Representative to have been included in the
computation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Transaction Expenses, Closing Severance Amount or Adjusted Closing
Indebtedness, in each case as finally determined in accordance with Section
3.3(c)), and this Agreement shall be construed accordingly.

SECTION 9.10 Specified Withdrawal Losses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the following provisions shall apply to indemnification of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any Specified Withdrawal Loss
pursuant to Section 9.1(h).

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Parties may only seek indemnification for claims
related to any Specified Withdrawal Loss pursuant to Section 9.1(h) and not
pursuant to any other subsection of Section 9.1.

(b) Buyer shall promptly notify (but in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days) the Stockholder's Representative upon receipt by Buyer, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates of a written assessment of
withdrawal liability from the Specified Plan with respect to a complete or
partial withdrawal within the meaning of ERISA Section 4203 or 4205 (as
modified by ERISA Section 4208(d)(1), as applicable) that occurred prior to
the Closing (the "Assessment"). Such notice provided by Buyer shall include a
copy of the written assessment received from the Specified Plan.

(c) If the Stockholders' Representative requests the Buyer to do so in writing
not later than ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of Buyer's notice
provided pursuant to Section 9.10(b) hereof, the Buyer shall and shall cause
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to take commercially reasonable
measures to dispute or, subject to this paragraph, settle the Assessment, only
if the Stockholders' Representative advances all costs and expenses on the
Buyer's behalf including the payment of all Assessment amounts that are due
and payable during the pendency of the settlement negotiations or dispute,
with any Assessment amounts being satisfied by a release from the Specified
Withdrawal Fund (and the Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative hereby
agree to provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to effect such
release). In the event that following a dispute or settlement of an Assessment
the Specified Plan refunds the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
any amounts released from the Specified Withdrawal Fund, the Buyer shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate to, deliver all such
refunded amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts to be designated by the Stockholders' Representative in
writing as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such instructions
from the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders' Representatives shall
be entitled to participate in the dispute of such Assessment at its own
expense and, to the extent that it wishes, to control the dispute of the
Assessment at its sole cost and expense. If the Stockholders' Representative
elects to control the dispute, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including

 the Surviving Company) to, reasonably assist and cooperate with the
Stockholders' Representative and its counsel. Such assistance and cooperation
will include providing reasonable access during normal business hours to
information, records, personnel and documents relating to the Assessment and
causing the Surviving Company to execute any documents or take any actions
reasonably necessary to effectuate the Stockholders' representative's control
of a dispute. If the Stockholders' Representative elects to control the
dispute, no compromise or settlement with respect to the Assessment may be
effected by the Stockholders' Representative without Buyer's consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If,
however, the Stockholders' Representative elects not to control the dispute,
no compromise or settlement with respect to the Assessment may be effected by
Buyer without the Stockholders' Representative's consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for
any Specified Withdrawal Losses that are covered by the indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(h) and this Section 9.10 shall be the Specified
Withdrawal Fund.

(e) The Deductible shall not apply to any Specified Withdrawal Losses.

(f) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its ERISA Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company) not to, take any actions intended to cause an Assessment to
be delivered or a Specified Withdrawal Loss to occur. Buyer hereby agrees not
to perform any work following the Closing in the jurisdiction of the agreement
referenced in Section 4.8(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule, unless such work
is performed in connection with an obligation to make contributions to the
Specified Plan. In the event that Buyer takes any action prohibited by this
Section 9.10(g), the indemnification provided pursuant to Section 9.1(h) and
this Section 9.10 shall not be available.

ARTICLE X

STOCKHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

SECTION 10.1 Stockholders' Representative.

(a) Appointment. Each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares)
and Option Holder constitutes and appoints the Stockholders' Representative to
act as such Person's representative under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, with full authority to act on behalf of, and to bind, each such
Person for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and the
Stockholders' Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The
Stockholders' Representative shall have full power and authority to represent
all of such Persons and their

 successors with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and all actions taken by the Stockholders' Representative
hereunder or thereunder shall be binding upon all such holders and their
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.
The Stockholders' Representative shall take any and all actions that it
believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement for and on behalf of such Persons, as fully as if such holders were
acting on their own behalf, including dealing with Buyer, the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement with respect to all matters arising hereunder or thereunder,
taking any and all other actions specified in or contemplated by this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and engaging counsel, accountants or other
Stockholders' representatives, in connection with any of the foregoing
matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders'
Representative shall have full power and authority to effect and interpret all
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the determination of the
Adjustment Amount, the prosecution, defense or settlement of any claims for
indemnification under Article IX and the authorization of disbursements and
payments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or the Escrow
Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all
such holders and their successors.

(b) Indemnification of the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders'
Representative may act upon any instrument or other writing believed by the
Stockholders' Representative in good faith to be genuine and to be signed or
presented by the proper Person and shall not be liable in connection with the
performance by it of its duties pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, except for its own willful default or gross
negligence. The Stockholders' Representative shall be, and hereby is,
indemnified and held harmless by each Stockholder (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares) and Option Holder, up to a maximum amount equal to such
Stockholder's or Option Holder's Pro Rata Portion, from all losses, costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by the Stockholders'
Representative as a result of the Stockholders' Representative's performance
of its duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; provided, that the
Stockholders' Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification for
losses, costs or expenses that result from any action taken or omitted by the
Stockholders' Representative as a result of its own willful default or gross
negligence.

(c) Reasonable Reliance. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine, accurate as to content and
signed by any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares), Option
Holder, Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent. The Stockholders'
Representative may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in
accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

(d) Attorney-in-Fact.

(i) The Stockholders' Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the
true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares) and Option Holder with full power in their name and on
their behalf to execute and act according to the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement in the absolute discretion of the Stockholders'
Representative; and in general to do all things and

 to perform all acts including, without limitation, executing and delivering
the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements, certificates, receipts,
instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in
connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Such appointment
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest.

(ii) This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and
shall be irrevocable, subject to replacement of the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to Section 10.1(f), and shall not be terminated by any
act of any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) or Option
Holder by operation of Law, whether by such holder's death, disability,
protective supervision or any other event.

(iii) Each Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) and Option
Holder waive any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate or
disaffirm the action of the Stockholders' Representative taken in good faith
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

(iv) Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this Section 10.1, no
agreement, instrument, acknowledgment or other act or document shall be
ineffective by reason only of a Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting
Shares) or an Option Holder having signed or given such act or document
directly instead of the Stockholders' Representative.

(e) Liability. If the Stockholders' Representative is required to determine
the occurrence of any event or contingency, the Stockholders' Representative
may request from any Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares)
and Option Holder, or any other Person, such reasonable additional evidence as
the Stockholders' Representative in its sole discretion may deem necessary to
determine any fact relating to the occurrence of such event or contingency,
and may at any time inquire of and consult with others, including any
Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) and Option Holder, and
the Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable to any such holder for
any damages resulting from its delay in acting hereunder pending its receipt
and examination of additional evidence requested by it. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement entered into or
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in no event shall the Stockholders' Representative be liable to
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates.

(f) Successor Representatives. The Stockholders' Representative shall
designate one or more Persons to serve as successor Stockholders'
Representatives in the event of its death, incapacity, bankruptcy or
dissolution, which Person or Persons shall in such event succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Stockholders'
Representative under this Agreement. Each successor Stockholders'
Representative shall designate one or more Persons to serve as successor
Stockholders' Representatives in the event of such successor Stockholders'
Representative's death, incapacity, bankruptcy or dissolution.

 SECTION 10.2 Expenses of the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders'
Representative shall be entitled to withdraw cash amounts held in the account
containing the Stockholders' Expense Amount in reimbursement for out of pocket
fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors' fees and
expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in
performing under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the event that
the Stockholders' Expense Amount is insufficient to cover the fees and
expenses incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in performing under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, first, the Stockholders' Representative
shall be entitled to be paid out of the Escrow Fund prior to any payments made
out of such fund for the benefit of the Preferred Stockholders, and second,
each of the Stockholders and Option Holders shall be obligated to pay their
share of any such deficiency, which share shall be determined by multiplying
(i) the amount of such deficiency by (ii) each such holder's Pro Rata Portion.

ARTICLE XI

TERMINATION

SECTION 11.1 Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated,
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, by
mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer.

SECTION 11.2 Termination by Either Buyer or the Company. This Agreement may be
terminated, and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, by action of either Buyer or the Company if (a) any order, decree,
ruling or other non-appealable final action has been issued by a Governmental
Entity permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger, or (b) the Merger shall not have been consummated
by November 30, 2018 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.2 shall not be
available to any party hereto whose action or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.3 Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated, and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, by the
Company:

(a) if the Company is not in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement of it under this Agreement such as would cause a condition
set forth in Section 8.2(a) to be incapable of being satisfied and there is a
breach by Buyer or Merger Sub of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement of them contained in this Agreement and such breach has not
been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Buyer, or
such breach cannot be cured, and would cause a condition set forth in Section
8.3(a) to be incapable of being satisfied; or

(b) if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their terms or
nature are to be satisfied by performance at the Closing, provided that such
conditions would be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the

 Company has sent written notice to Buyer confirming that the Company stands
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, and (iii) Buyer fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the first date
on which the Closing was required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2; provided
that any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.2, 11.3(a) or
11.4 shall be deemed a termination pursuant to this Section 11.3(b) if prior
to the time of such termination the conditions set forth in this Section
11.3(b) have been satisfied.

SECTION 11.4 Termination by Buyer. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, by written
notice given to the Company by Buyer, if Buyer is not in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of it under this
Agreement such as would give cause a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) to
be incapable of being satisfied and (a) there is a breach by the Company of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of it contained in
this Agreement, and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after written notice thereof to the Company, or such breach cannot be cured,
and would cause a condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) to be incapable of
being satisfied, or (b) if, within 24 hours after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Stockholder Written Consent shall not have been
executed and delivered to the Company, with a copy to Buyer, duly adopting the
resolutions contained therein.

SECTION 11.5 Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article XI, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other parties hereto, and this Agreement (other than as set forth in this
Section 11.5 and other than Section 6.5 (Public Announcements), Section 6.10
(Expenses), Article I and Article XII) shall become void and of no effect with
no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its respective
Representatives); provided, however, except as otherwise provided herein, no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any Intentional Fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement and Buyer shall remain liable for payment of the Termination Fee and
other liabilities as provided in this Section 11.5. If this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger is abandoned pursuant to this Article XI, all
confidential information received by Buyer or its Representatives and
Affiliates with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of
this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.3 (including any
termination deemed to be pursuant to Section 11.3), then Buyer shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) following such termination, pay $5,750,000 (the "Termination Fee") to
the Company (or its designee(s)) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the first sentence
of this Section 11.5(b) and the Company (or its designee(s)) shall receive
full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 11.5(b), the
receipt of the Termination Fee, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any
and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and

 neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding against Buyer or any of its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, partners,
members, managers, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors or permitted
assigns (collectively, "Buyer Parties") or, without limiting Section 12.13,
any Financing Sources arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination; provided that nothing in
this Section 11.5(b) shall limit the right of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their Representatives (x) to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or
proceeding against Buyer or any Buyer Parties arising out of or in connection
with any breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or (y) to be indemnified and
reimbursed for expenses in accordance with Section 6.16(b). Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
Section 11.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement. Buyer and the Company acknowledge and agree that (1)
Buyer and the Company have expressly negotiated the provisions of this Section
11.5(b), (2) in light of the circumstances existing at the time of the
execution of this Agreement (including the inability of the parties hereto to
quantify the damages that may be suffered by the Company) the provisions of
this Section 11.5(b) are reasonable, (3) the Termination Fee represents a good
faith, fair estimate of the damages that the Company would suffer as a result
of the termination of this Agreement and the failure of Buyer to acquire the
Company, and (4) the Termination Fee shall be payable as liquidated damages
(and not as a penalty) without requiring the Company or any other Person to
prove actual damages.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
Section 11.5), under no circumstances will the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their Affiliates be entitled to aggregate monetary damages or other
monetary remedies for any losses, liabilities, expenses or damages suffered as
a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or for any
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith, in
any case, in excess of the sum of (i) the Termination Fee and (ii) all costs
and expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Company or its Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives (including fees and expenses of counsel)
in connection with their compliance with Section 6.16, in each case, subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 11.5(b).

(d) Notwithstanding this Section 11.5 or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, but subject in all respects to Section 12.9(b), Buyer affirms
that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its obligations under
this Agreement that Buyer obtain financing for or related to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII

and schedules hereto) and the Transaction Agreements set forth the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Except for the matters set forth in the

provided, however, that Buyer shall be permitted to assign this Agreement to

Person from which it or its Affiliates has borrowed money or obtained
financing for collateral security purposes (provided that in the case of
clause (i) or (ii) Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations
hereunder following such assignment). All the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. Except for the
provisions set forth in Sections 6.6, 12.12 and 12.14, nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, or shall be construed to, confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

or definition of this Agreement to the extent that such amendment or waiver
would modify the substance of any such foregoing Section or defined term used
therein) that is material and adverse to any Financing Source shall be
effective as to such Financing Source without the written consent of the Lead
Arranger. Any amendment, modification or revision of this Agreement and any
waiver of compliance or consent with respect hereto shall be effective only if
in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.

SECTION 12.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to principles of conflicts
of laws thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any right or obligation with respect to any Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and any claim, controversy, dispute, suit,
action or proceeding relating thereto or arising thereunder, shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby (i)
consents to service of process in any legal action, suit or proceeding among
the parties to this Agreement arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement
in any manner permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) agrees that
service of process made in accordance with this Section 12.5 or made by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 12.3, will constitute good and valid service of
process in any such legal action, suit or proceeding, and (iii) waives and
agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any
such legal action, suit or proceeding any claim that service of process made
in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid
service of process. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, New
Castle County, or a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d)
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of improper
venue or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required
of any other party with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each party hereto hereby submits itself to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York and any appellate courts
thereof with respect to any suit, action or proceeding against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in
equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and hereby agrees that it
will not bring or support any such suit, action or proceeding in any other
forum.

SECTION 12.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT,
THE FINANCING OR THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR BY THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY.

SECTION 12.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of the Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to
the original intent of the parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

SECTION 12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any amendments
hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of digital imaging and
electronic mail or a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original

 contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

SECTION 12.9 Specific Performance.

(a) Subject to Section 12.9(b), the parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to
Section 12.9(b), Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of competent jurisdiction, including the right of the Company to cause
Buyer to fully perform the terms of this Agreement to the fullest extent
permissible pursuant to this Agreement and applicable Laws and to thereafter
cause this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and
shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party may have under this
Agreement. Subject to Section 12.9(b), each of the parties hereby waives (i)
any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate, and (ii) any requirement
under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. If any party hereto brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
the other party prior to the Termination Date, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended for so long as the party bringing such action is
actively seeking a court order for an injunction or injunctions or to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including the provisions
of Section 12.9(a), the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief, with respect to the obligation of Buyer
to effect the Closing, shall only be available in the event that: (i) all
conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been
satisfied or waived at the time when the Closing would have occurred pursuant
to the terms hereof (other than those conditions which by their terms or
nature are to be satisfied by performance at the Closing, provided that such
conditions would be satisfied or waived at the Closing); (ii) the Financing
has been funded or will be funded in accordance with the terms of the
Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing; and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Buyer that: (A) all conditions to
the Closing set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.3 have been satisfied or that the
Company is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions (other than those
conditions which by their terms or nature are to be satisfied by performance
at the Closing, provided that such conditions would be satisfied or waived at
the Closing), and (B) if specific performance is granted and the Financing is
funded, then the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may pursue a grant of specific
performance as expressly permitted by this Section 12.9(b) and the payment of
the Termination Fee by Buyer, but under no circumstances shall Buyer be
obligated to both specifically perform the terms of this Agreement and pay the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 11.5(b).

SECTION 12.10 Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto acknowledge that they are
sophisticated parties and have been represented by legal counsel throughout
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that the terms of the

 provisions hereof have been carefully negotiated by such legal counsel.
Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby agree that the presumptions of Laws or
rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should not be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument executed in connection herewith, and each party hereto hereby
waives the application thereof.

SECTION 12.11 Disclosure Schedule. The representations and warranties
contained in Article IV are qualified by reference to the disclosures as are
specifically set forth in the appropriate section, subsection or subclause of
the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that
(i) the Disclosure Schedule may include items or information that the Company
is not required to disclose under this Agreement, (ii) disclosure of such
items or information shall not affect, directly or indirectly, the
interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the disclosure obligation of
the Company under this Agreement, and (iii) inclusion of information in the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to the Company. Similarly, in such matters where a
representation or warranty is given or other information is provided, the
disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not imply that any
other undisclosed matter having a greater value or other significance is
material. Buyer and Merger Sub further acknowledge that (A) headings have been
inserted on sections of the Disclosure Schedule for the convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any
of the provisions of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, (B) cross
references that may be contained in sections of the Disclosure Schedule to
other sections of the Disclosure Schedule are not all-inclusive of all
disclosures contained on such referenced sections of the Disclosure Schedule,
and (C) information contained in various sections of the Disclosure Schedule
may be applicable to other sections of the Disclosure Schedule; accordingly,
every matter, document or item referred to, set forth or described in one
section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed under each
and every part, category, heading or subheading of such section and all other
sections of the Disclosure Schedule and shall be deemed to qualify the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement, to the extent
such matter, document or item may apply if (x) a cross-reference to such other
section of the Disclosure Schedule is made, or (y) it is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure that the disclosed matter, document or item
would relate to other representations or warranties or the matters covered
thereby.

SECTION 12.12 Provisions Respecting Representation of the Company. Each of
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and the other parties hereto hereby agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners,
stockholders, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Covington and Burling LLP
and any other legal counsel representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing (each, a "Prior Company Counsel") may serve
as counsel to any of the Stockholders' Representative, Principal Stockholder,
other Stockholders, Option Holders, and any of each such Person's respective
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (individually and
collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, any Prior Company Counsel may serve as
counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, stockholder,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

 notwithstanding such prior representation of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict
of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any
Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation. Buyer further agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
following the Closing, that in the event the Stockholders' Representative
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim brought against any Buyer
Indemnified Party (including the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
in accordance with Section 9.3, notwithstanding that any Prior Company Counsel
may be representing the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with such
Third Party Claim, Buyer waives any claim of conflict of interest with respect
to any Prior Company Counsel's representation of the Seller Group in
connection with any dispute between Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative
or any member of the Seller Group, including in connection with disputes under
this Agreement. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all privileged communications prior to the
Closing between the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Seller Group, on the
one hand, and their external legal counsel, including any Prior Company
Counsel, on the other hand, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any
matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged communications between
the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Seller Group and such counsel
(collectively, the "Privileged Communications") and belong solely to the
Seller Group, and from and after the Closing none of the Surviving Company,
its Subsidiaries, Buyer or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or
through the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries shall seek to obtain such
communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
or through any other means. To the extent that files in respect of any
Privileged Communications constitute client property, only the Seller Group
shall hold such property rights. As to any such Privileged Communications
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, and each of its
Subsidiaries together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the
parties hereto after the Closing. This Section 12.12 is for the benefit of the
Seller Group and each Prior Company Counsel, and the Seller Group and each
Prior Company Counsel are express third party beneficiaries of this Section
12.12. This Section 12.12 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section
12.12 may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of
each of the Seller Group and each Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.

SECTION 12.13 Liability of Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company and the Stockholders' Representative
(on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates, each officer, director,
employee, member, manager, partner, controlling person, advisor, attorney,
agent and representative thereof and the Stockholders) (i) hereby waives any
claims or rights against any Financing Source relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in
tort, contract or otherwise, (ii) hereby agrees not to bring or support any
suit, action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in
tort, contract or otherwise, and (iii) hereby agrees to cause any suit, action
or proceeding asserted against any Financing Source by or

 on behalf of the Company or the Stockholders' Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates or any officer, director, employee, member, manager,
partner, controlling person, advisor, attorney, agent and representative
thereof or the Stockholders in connection with this Agreement, the Financing,
the Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to
be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing waivers and agreements, it is acknowledged and agreed that no
Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or damages to the
Company or the Stockholders' Representative in connection with this Agreement,
the Financing, the Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

SECTION 12.14 Financing Sources as Third-Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, each Financing Source is intended
to be, and shall be, an express third-party beneficiary of this Section 12.14
and Sections 11.5, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5 12.6 and 12.13.
