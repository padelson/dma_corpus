WHEREAS, the Principal owns a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the
Seller, is the Sellers Chief Executive Officer, and in connection herewith
will enter into an employment agreement with the Buyer;

 

WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase and acquire from the Seller, and the
Seller desires to sell and transfer to the Buyer, substantially all of the
assets of the Seller, and the Buyer desires to assume, and the Seller desires
to assign to the Buyer, certain of the liabilities of the Seller, all on the
terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth; and

Date_ " and such time on the Closing Date is referred to as the " _Closing
Time_.")

 

1.2 

 

 _Sale of Purchased Assets_.

 

(a) 

 

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the Closing,
the Seller shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to the Buyer, and
the Buyer shall purchase, all of the Sellers right, title and interest in and
to all of the assets, properties, business and goodwill, wherever located,
owned, used or held by the Seller (collectively, the " _Purchased Assets_ "),
excluding only the Excluded Assets, free and clear of any Liens (other than
Permitted Liens), including, without limitation:

 

(i)

 

all accounts and other receivables as of the Closing Date;

 

(ii)

 

all prepaid assets, expenses, rent and insurance benefits, rights and proceeds
of the Seller as of the Closing Date;

 

(iii)

 

all items of tangible personal property;

 

(iv)

 

all inventory (including, without limitation, finished goods, raw materials
and work in process) on hand, and all goods in transit, as of the Closing
Date;

 

(v)

 

all Contracts, other than the Excluded Contracts;

 

(vi)

 

all Company Intellectual Property, and all rights with respect to any claims
(past, present or future) with respect thereto and the right to all Damages
payable in respect thereof;

 

(vii)

 

the business and goodwill of the Seller as a going concern; and

 

(viii)

(b) 

 

Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement or in any Related
Agreement, the following assets shall not be included in the Purchased Assets
to be sold or acquired pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Excluded Assets_ "):

 

(i)

 

all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the Closing Date;

referred to in this sentence shall be held and/or received by the Seller for
the benefit of the Buyer so that the Buyer will be in substantially the same

1.4 

 

 _Purchase Price; Delivery of Purchase Price; Escrow Account_

 

. 

 

(a) 

 

In consideration of the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller (or its designee) aggregate consideration (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") as follows: the sum of (i) cash in the amount of
$110,000,000, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 1.5, _plus_ (ii)
at the times and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 1.6,
the Deferred Purchase Price.

 

(b) 

 

At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller (or its designee) an amount
equal to (i) $110,000,000, _less_ the Escrow Amount. Such amount shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by the Seller at least two Business Days prior to the Closing, and
the Escrow Amount shall be deposited by the Buyer into the Escrow Account and
held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) 

 

At the Closing, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer shall deposit
$5,500,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow account, such escrow
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") to be established and maintained in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to (i) provide security for
the payment by the Seller or the Principal of any amounts that become due in
accordance with Article IX and (ii) hold any disputed amounts deposited
pursuant to Section 1.6(f).

 

1.5 

 

 _Purchase Price Adjustment_

 

. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(a) 

 

Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a
statement setting forth the Average Working Capital (the " _Average Working
Capital Statement_ ") and the Closing Date Working Capital (the " _Closing
Date Working Capital Statement_ " together with the Average Working Capital
Statement, the " _Working Capital Statements_ "), each prepared in accordance
with GAAP, applying the same accounting principles, policies and practices
that were used in preparing the Audited Financial Statements, including the
GAAP Exceptions. The Working Capital Statements shall become final and
binding upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof, unless
the Seller gives notice of its disagreement with the Average Working Capital
Statement and/or the Closing Date Working Capital Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or
based on the Average Working Capital Statement and/or Closing Date Working
Capital Statement not being calculated pursuant to this Section 1.5. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by the Buyer in a timely manner, then the
Working Capital Statements (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall
become final and binding upon the Buyer and the Seller on the earlier of (A)
the date the Buyer and the Seller resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B)
the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting Firm. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, the Buyer and the Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period,
the Buyer and the Seller shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set
forth in this Section 1.5, only matters that remain in dispute and were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement in accordance with this
Section 1.5 and any claim of calculation-related errors. The Accounting Firm
shall be KPMG LLP (which the parties represent has not provided services to
any of them or their respective subsidiaries during the past three years) or,
if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the Buyer and
the Seller in writing. The Buyer and the Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 30 days of the
receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether the items in dispute that were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement were correctly determined
pursuant to this Section 1.5 and may include calculation-related errors, and
the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. The Accounting
Firms decision shall be based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and
the Seller and their respective representatives and by reference to the terms
of this Agreement. The Seller and the Buyer shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information related to the disputed matters as the Accounting Firm may request
and are reasonably available to the Seller, the Buyer or their respective
agents. The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in dispute and
calculation-related errors. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be borne by the
Buyer and the Seller equally.

 

(b) 

 

Within ten Business Days after the Working Capital Statements become final and
binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1.5, the following shall
occur:

 

(A)

 

if the Average Working Capital is greater than the Closing Date Working
Capital, then the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to (x) 50% of
the amount by which the Average Working Capital is up to $3,000,000 greater
than the Closing Date Working Capital, _plus_ (y) 100% of the amount by which
the Average Working Capital is more than $3,000,000 greater than the Closing
Date Working Capital; or

 

(B)

 

if the Average Working Capital is less than the Closing Date Working Capital,
then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount by which
the Average Working Capital is less than the Closing Date Working Capital; or

 

(C)

 

if the Average Working Capital is equal to the Closing Date Working Capital,
then no adjustment will be made to the Purchase Price.

 

All payments to be made under this Section 1.5(b) shall be made by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, together with interest on the amount
to be so paid from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Interest on such
amount shall be at the rate of 6% per annum.

 

(c) 

 

The Buyer agrees that following the Closing it shall not take any actions,
including by not maintaining appropriate books and records, which would affect
the ability of any party to calculate the Closing Date Working Capital in
accordance with the terms hereof, determine the grounds for any Notice of
Disagreement or evaluate any disagreement set forth in a Notice of
Disagreement. During the period of time from and after the delivery of the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement through the final determination of the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement, the Seller and/or its authorized
representatives shall have the right, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to examine and have copies of those books and records
of the Buyer relevant to the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement, and may have reasonable access to employees of the Buyer directly
involved in preparing the Closing Date Working Capital Statement for purposes
of asking questions relating thereto. Such rights of access shall be
exercised in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the operations
of the Buyer.

 

1.6 

 

 _Deferred Purchase Price_

 

. 

 

(a) 

 

As additional purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the " _Deferred
Purchase Price_ "), the Buyer shall make payments (the " _Deferred Purchase
Price Payments_ ") to the Seller (or its designee) as and to the extent, if
any, provided in accordance with Section 1.6(d). Any Deferred Purchase Price
Payments due to the Seller pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be paid to the
Seller (or its designee), within 90 days after the end of each Measurement
Period for any Deferred Purchase Price Payment due for such Measurement
Period, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Seller. The Buyer shall not be obligated to pay
interest on the Deferred Purchase Price (except as provided in Section 1.6(h))
and shall report the payment of the Deferred Purchase Price Payments as a part
of the Purchase Price for all federal, state and local Tax purposes as
exclusively payments for goodwill, in addition to that portion of goodwill
included within the allocation of the Purchase Price, and the Buyer and the
Seller shall file their Tax Returns accordingly.

 

(b) 

 

Within 90 days after the end of each Measurement Period, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller a written statement (each, a " _Payment Statement_ "),
including supporting documentation, setting forth the EBIT calculation for the
applicable Measurement Period and the amount of Deferred Purchase Price, if
any, for such Measurement Period. On the date each Payment Statement is
delivered the amount of the Deferred Purchase Price Payment, if any, set forth
in such Payment Statement shall be paid in the manner described in Section
1.6(a). The applicable Payment Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the 45th day following delivery thereof, unless the Seller
gives notice of its disagreement with such Payment Statement (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") to the Buyer prior to such date. Any Dispute Notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. If a Dispute
Notice is received by the Buyer in a timely manner, then the amount of the
applicable Deferred Purchase Price Payment shall become final and binding upon
the Buyer and the Seller on the earlier of (A) the date the Buyer and the
Seller resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Dispute Notice and (B) the date any disputed matters
are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 45-day
period (the " _Resolution Period_ ") following the delivery of a Dispute
Notice, the Buyer and the Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Dispute Notice. At the end of the Resolution Period, the
Buyer and the Seller shall submit to the Accounting Firm for arbitration, in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Section 1.6, only matters that
remain in dispute and were properly included in the Dispute Notice in
accordance with this Section 1.6. The Buyer and the Seller shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within
30 days of their delivery of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether the items in
dispute that were properly included in the Dispute Notice were correctly
determined pursuant to this Section 1.6 and may include calculation-related
errors, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. The
Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on written submissions by the
Buyer and the Seller and their respective representatives and by reference to
the terms of this Agreement. The Seller and the Buyer shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents
and information related to the disputed matters as the Accounting Firm may
request and are reasonably available to the Seller, the Buyer or their
respective agents. The Accounting Firm shall address only those items in
dispute and calculation-related errors. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. To the extent it is
determined in accordance with this Section 1.6 that a Deferred Purchase Price
Payment was not accurately made, if the Deferred Purchase Price Payment as
determined hereunder is greater than the Deferred Purchase Price Payment made,
the Buyer shall, and if the Deferred Purchase Price Payment as determined
hereunder is less than the Deferred Purchase Price Payment made, the Seller
shall, within ten Business Days after such determination, make payment to the
other party by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of
such difference. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be borne by the Buyer and the Seller
equally. 

 

(c) 

 

The Seller and/or its authorized representatives shall have the right upon and
after receipt of a Payment Statement and through the end of the applicable
Resolution Period, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to examine (and, at the Sellers expense, have copies made of) those
books and records of the Buyer pertaining to transactions arising out of or
relating to the calculation of the applicable Deferred Compensation Payment,
and may have reasonable access to employees of the Buyer directly involved in
calculating Deferred Purchase Price Payments for purposes of asking questions
relating to such calculations. Such rights of access shall be exercised in a
manner that does not unreasonable interfere with the operations of the Buyer.

 

(d) 

 

If EBIT (as set forth in the applicable Payment Statement): 

 

(A) for the First Measurement Period is greater than $19,000,000, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller (or its designee) in accordance with this Section 1.6,
the amount set forth on Appendix B; _provided_ , _however_ , such amount shall
be no greater than $15,000,000. 

 

(C) for the Second Measurement Period is greater than $21,600,000, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller (or its designee) in accordance with this Section 1.6,
the amount set forth on Appendix B; _provided_ , _however_ , such amount shall
be no greater than $25,000,000;

 

(D) for the Third Measurement Period is greater than $23,400,000, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller (or its designee) in accordance with this Section 1.6,
the amount set forth on Appendix B; _provided_ , _however_ , such amount shall
be no greater than $30,000,000. 

 

In connection with the foregoing, if EBIT during the applicable Measurement
Period falls between the minimum EBIT amount and the maximum EBIT amount for
the First Measurement Period or the minimum EBIT amount and the break point
EBIT amount or the break point EBIT amount and the maximum EBIT amount for the
Second Measurement Period or the Third Measurement Period, as the case may be
(as set forth on Appendix B), linear interpolation between such points, as the
case may be, will be utilized to calculate the Deferred Purchase Price Payment
due to the Seller. For purposes of clarification, the Seller shall not be
entitled to receive Deferred Purchase Price Payments (i) in excess of
$70,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) with respect to a Measurement Period, if
EBIT for such Measurement Period does not meet the minimum threshold amount
set forth above with respect to such Measurement Period.

 

(e) 

 

If during any Measurement Period a transfer to a third party that is not an
Affiliate of the Buyer, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the Business, occurs, excluding
in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Buyer (an " _Acceleration Event_ "), the Buyer agrees to pay the Seller (or
its designee) an amount equal to the Deferred Purchase Price Payment(s)
remaining to be paid as of the date of such Acceleration Event, assuming that
the Business achieved the maximum EBIT amount set forth on Appendix B in each
remaining Measurement Period (the " _Acceleration Event Amount_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acceleration Event Amount will be paid on a
present value basis using a discount rate of 8% per annum (pro rated for any
partial period). Payment of the discounted Acceleration Event Amount shall be
made by the Buyer as soon as practicable but not less than ten Business Days
after the completion of such Acceleration Event. The Seller agrees that
payment by the Buyer of the discounted Acceleration Event Amount shall be
deemed to constitute performance in full and discharge by the Buyer of its
obligation under this Agreement to make the Deferred Purchase Price Payments.
The payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account as the Seller shall designate in writing to the Buyer.

 

(f) 

 

If (i) the Buyer makes a claim for indemnification against the Seller or the
Principal in accordance with the terms of Article IX, (ii) the Seller or the
Principal, as the case may be, disputes such indemnification claim by written
notice to the Buyer, and (iii) the amount of such claim exceeds amounts then
remaining in the Escrow Account not then subject to a claim or claims for
indemnification under Article IX (such excess amount, the " _Excess Amount_
"), then the Buyer may deposit the Excess Amount from the proceeds of any
Deferred Purchase Price Payment which is then otherwise due and payable in the
Escrow Account.

 

(g) 

 

Notwithstanding that a Deferred Purchase Price Payment has become final and
binding in accordance with Section 1.6(b), if within two years following the
date that such Deferred Purchase Price Payment became final and binding, the
Buyer discovers that there were errors or omissions in the books and records
of the Business or that accounting principles relating to the Business were
not properly applied for the applicable Measurement Period and, as a result,
the Buyer determines that the applicable EBIT upon which such Deferred
Purchase Price Payment was made to the Seller was incorrect, then the Buyer
may deliver a corrected Payment Statement to the Seller for such Measurement
Period, including supporting documentation, setting forth the corrected EBIT
calculation for such Measurement Period and the amount of the corrected
Deferred Purchase Price Payment. The corrected Payment Statement shall become
final and binding upon the parties using the same resolution procedures and
time periods set forth in Section 1.6(b) as if such corrected Payment
Statement was a Payment Statement originally delivered pursuant to Section
1.6(b). The Seller shall, within ten Business Days after the corrected
Payment Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with this Section
1.6(g), make payment to the Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available
funds of the amount of any difference between the corrected Deferred Purchase
Price Payment and the applicable original Deferred Purchase Price Payment,
together with interest on the amount of such difference from the date the
original Deferred Purchase Price Payment was made to the date of payment of
such difference. Interest on the amount of such difference shall be at the
rate of 8% per annum. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred,
if any, pursuant to this Section 1.6(g) shall be borne by the Buyer and the
Seller equally.

 

(h) 

 

The Buyer shall pay interest on the applicable Deferred Purchase Price
Payment, if any, if it is not paid within 90 days after the end of the
applicable Measurement Period. Interest shall be payable from the date the
applicable Deferred Purchase Price Payment was due to the date of payment. If
a Dispute Notice is properly delivered with respect to any Deferred Purchase
Price Payment and it is thereafter determined in accordance with Section
1.6(b) that the Deferred Purchase Price Payment made was at least 3% less than
the correct Deferred Purchase Price Payment that should have been made, then
the Buyer shall pay the difference owed to the Seller as provided in Section
1.6(b), together with interest on the amount of such difference from the date
such Deferred Purchase Price Payment was due to the date of payment. Interest
on any payment made pursuant to this Section 1.6(h) shall be at the rate of 8%
per annum.

 

(i) 

 

Following the Closing Date until the end of Third Measurement Period, the
Buyer, the Seller and the Principal agree to comply with Paragraph (b) of
Appendix B hereto.

 

1.7 

 

 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

 The Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) shall be allocated
among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Code §1060 and the Treasury
regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law, as appropriate) as set forth on Appendix C hereto. Within 60 days after
the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Seller shall mutually prepare an
allocation of the Purchase Price consistent with Appendix C, which allocation
shall be binding upon the Buyer, the Seller and the Principal. The Buyer, the
Seller, the Principal and their Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax
Returns (including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in
all respects and for all purposes consistent with such allocation. The Buyer,
the Seller and the Principal shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file
and deliver all such documents, forms and other information as may be
necessary to prepare such allocation. None of the Buyer, the Seller and the
Principal shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so
by applicable Law.

 

1.8 

 

 _Power of Attorney_

 

. After the Closing Time, the Buyer shall have the right and authority to
endorse, without recourse, the name of the Seller on any check or other
evidence of indebtedness received by the Buyer on account of any Purchased
Asset (but the Buyer shall not have such right and authority with respect to
any check or other evidence of indebtedness received by the Buyer on account
of any Excluded Asset), and the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer at the
Closing copies of such documents reasonably requested by the Buyer, certified
by the Seller, to permit the Buyer to deposit such checks or other evidences
of indebtedness in bank accounts in the name of the Buyer. As of the Closing
Time, the Seller shall constitute and appoint the Buyer the true and lawful
attorney of the Seller with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Seller, or in the name of the Buyer, at the expense of the Buyer and for the
benefit of the Buyer, (a) to collect, assert or enforce any claim, right or
title of any kind in or to the Purchased Assets, to institute and prosecute
all actions, suits and proceedings which the Buyer may deem proper in order to
collect, assert or enforce any such claim, right or title, to defend and
compromise all actions, suits and proceedings in respect of any of the
Purchased Assets, and to do all such acts and things in relation thereto as
the Buyer shall deem advisable and (b) to take all action which the Buyer may
deem proper in order to provide for the Buyer the benefits of or under any of
the Purchased Assets where any required consent of a third party to the
assignment thereof to the Buyer shall not have been obtained; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller shall have no Liability for any such actions taken
by the Buyer. The Seller acknowledges that such powers are coupled with an
interest and shall not be revocable by it in any manner or for any reason,
including, without limitation, the liquidation or dissolution of the Seller,
and that the Buyer shall be entitled to retain for its own account any amounts
collected pursuant to such powers, including any amounts payable as interest
in respect thereof. Such powers shall be granted by such powers of attorney
and other instruments as shall be reasonably requested by the Buyer.

 

1.9 

 

 _Actions Simultaneous_

 

. All actions to be taken and all documents to be executed and delivered by
all parties at the Closing shall be deemed to have been taken and executed and
delivered simultaneously and no actions shall be deemed to have been taken nor

actions have been taken and all documents have been executed and delivered.

  _OTHER AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES_

 

6.1 

 

 _Cooperation in Litigation_

 

. From and after the Closing Date (until the third anniversary of the last
day of the Third Measurement Period), each party shall provide to the other
such cooperation as may reasonably be requested in connection with the defense
of any litigation relating to the Business whether existing on the Closing
Date or arising thereafter out of, or relating to, an occurrence or event
happening before the Closing Date.

 

6.2 

 

 _Employees_.

 

(a) 

 

From and after the date hereof until the Closing Time, the Seller shall, and
the Principal shall cause the Seller to, use its reasonable best efforts to
assist the Buyer in retaining, subsequent to the Closing Time, all employees
of the Seller and the Hong Kong Subsidiary. 

 

(b) 

 

The Buyer will offer to employ each employee of the Seller, other than the
Excluded Employee, commencing on the Closing Date, with initial compensation
and benefits which in the aggregate are no less favorable than those provided
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each such employee who accepts such
employment and commences employment with the Buyer is herein referred to as a
" _Transferred Employee_ ". Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such employee
who is on an approved leave of absence on the Closing Date shall become a
Transferred Employee on the date such employee commences employment with the
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to
require the Buyer to continue to offer employment to any such employee other
than to the extent required by Law. Nothing herein shall prevent the Buyer
from changing the compensation or benefits of the Transferred Employees
subsequent to the Closing Date. The Seller shall be solely liable for any
severance payments due to any of its employees not willing to accept the
Buyers offer of employment and as a result of the employees termination or
layoff from employment with the Seller prior to or as of the Closing Date
notwithstanding the Buyers offer of employment and hiring of any employees. 

 

(c) 

 

The Buyer shall assume all of the Employee Plans (other than vacation, which
shall be treated as described in Section 6.2(e)) as of the Closing Date, but
not for Liabilities with respect to events occurring prior to the Closing
Time, and shall initially provide coverage for Transferred Employees under the
Employee Plans, with credit given for years of service with the Seller, except
as provided in Section 6.2(d). Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Buyer from amending or terminating any of the Employee Plans at any time after
the Closing Time.

 

(d) 

 

Each Transferred Employee will receive service credit for all periods of
employment with the Seller prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under any employee plan within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA in which such Transferred Employee participates after the
Closing Date, but specifically excluding credit for benefit accrual purposes.

 

(e) 

 

At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a schedule showing the
accrued vacation entitlement with the Seller for each salaried employee of the
Seller that is expected to become a Transferred Employee. Prior to the
Closing, the Seller shall cooperate with, and assist, the Buyer in seeking the
written consent of salaried employees of the Seller, other than the Excluded
Employee, who have accrued but unused vacation time to the conversion of such
time into Bonus Time and associated vacation pay into the Bonus Time Accruals,
and the substitution of the Buyer for the Seller as the obligor with respect
thereto. The Buyer shall reasonably accommodate each salaried Transferred
Employee who executes such a consent to permit such Transferred Employee to
take his or her Bonus Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
Transferred Employee does not use his or her Bonus Time by December 31, 2007,
the Buyer shall have the right to pay such Transferred Employee an amount
equal to his or her Bonus Time Accruals in lieu of permitting the Transferred
Employee to use the Bonus Time. The Buyer shall be under no obligation to
accommodate requests to use Bonus Time in excess of what is shown on the
schedule delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.2(e). The
Seller shall transfer to the Buyer at the Closing an amount equal to the total
cost of accrued vacation pay of all salaried employees who are expected to
become Transferred Employees from whom a valid consent has been obtained and
which accrued vacation entitlement is converted into Bonus Time for said
employees during their employment with the Buyer, and, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 6.2(e), the Buyer shall be solely responsible for the
payment of such amount to such Transferred Employees as herein provided.  
The Bonus Time is an accommodation provided to the applicable Transferred
Employees and is not a part of and is entirely separate from the vacation
accrual benefit such Transferred Employees are entitled to receive from the
Buyer under the Buyers vacation benefit for its employees. The Bonus Time
shall be administered separately from the Buyers vacation benefit provided to
Transferred Employees.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Seller shall be responsible to pay vacation accruals for (i) all of its
non-salaried employees, (ii) for any salaried Transferred Employee who does
not execute a consent in accordance with this Section 6.2(e) prior to the
Closing, even if at the time the schedule delivered pursuant to this Section
6.2(e) it is anticipated that such a consent will be delivered (or if such
consent has been delivered but is revoked prior to the Closing), (iii) for any
salaried employee of the Seller who does not become a Transferred Employee,
even if at the time the schedule delivered pursuant to this Section 6.2(e) it
is anticipated that such employee is to become a Transferred Employee and (iv)
time in excess of what is shown on such schedule. In the event that the
Seller pays amounts to the Buyer under this Section 6.2(e) with respect to an
employee that either does not become a Transferred Employee or has not
delivered a valid consent (or revokes a valid consent prior to the Closing),
the Buyer shall return such amounts to the Seller for the Seller to pay
vacation accruals to such employees. 

 

(f) 

 

Within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller
shall prepare a statement in form and substance satisfactory to the Buyer and
the Seller to be released to the employees of the Seller and the Hong Kong
Subsidiary with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including
compensation, benefits and employment continuation or opportunity following
the Closing. If the Seller, in good faith, determines that it is necessary or
advisable for it to issue a notice under WARN or any comparable applicable
state Law, the Seller shall have the right to include such notice as part of
the materials distributed to the employees.

 

(g) 

 

Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer employment to all
employees of the Hong Kong Subsidiary (other than employees who are providing
services to Michelsons Limited) on terms and conditions which are in the
aggregate no less favorable than those enjoyed by such employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
Buyer shall not have established a representative office in Shengzhou Province
prior to the Closing Date, then the Buyer shall notify the Seller (at least 15
Business Days prior to the Closing Date) and not offer employment to such
employees until the date on which such representative office is established
(the " _Delayed Offer Date_ ") and during the period from the Closing Date
until the Delayed Offer Date, the Seller shall cause the Hong Kong Subsidiary
to continue to employ such employees, and effective on the Closing Date the
Buyer and the Seller shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Hong Kong Subsidiary be
obligated to employ such employees beyond the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date. The Hong Kong Subsidiary shall be responsible to provide (and
the Seller shall cause the Hong Kong Subsidiary to provide) the employees of
the Hong Kong Subsidiary with notice of the termination of their employment as
and to the extent required by applicable Law or contract.

 

6.3 

 

 _Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Non-Derogation and Confidentiality_.

 

(a) 

 

From and after the Closing Date (until the third anniversary of the last day
of the Third Measurement Period), each of the Seller and the Principal shall
not, directly or indirectly, engage in, be employed by, be a consultant to,
own, manage, operate, provide financing to, control or participate in the
ownership, management or control of, or otherwise have an interest in, or aid
or assist any other Person in the conduct of, any Restricted Business or any
Person who is engaged in any Restricted Business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller and the Principal shall not be precluded from ownership of (i)
the Buyers issued and outstanding stock or other securities of the Buyer (and
any successors thereto), or (ii) less than 2% of the issued and outstanding
stock or other securities of a corporation listed on a national securities
exchange, electronic quotation and trading system or traded in the over-the-
counter market. For purposes of this Section 6.3, " _Restricted Business_ "
means the business of developing, designing, manufacturing or causing the
manufacture of, distributing, merchandising and licensing, throughout the
world, neckwear and related products; _provided_ , _however_ , that for a
period of one year following the Closing Date, ownership of the Excluded
Entities by the Seller or the Principal shall not constitute ownership of a
Restricted Business, and the Principal shall be permitted to dedicate a
portion of his business time and attention to the sale, disposal and/or

From and after the Closing Date, until the third anniversary of the last day
of the Third Measurement Period, each of the Seller and the Principal shall

not make, and shall not direct or instruct any family member, friend, agent or
representative to make any comment or act in any manner, which is derogatory

employees (current or former), their operation of the Business, the Business
itself or any products manufactured, sold or distributed by the Buyer, its
Affiliates, its licensees or its licensors. The Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, issue or make any comment or act in any manner
which is derogatory towards, or which is not respectful of, the Seller or the
Principal or any member of the Principals immediate family or any of their
respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Buyer, the Seller, the Principal or any of their
Affiliates from making any such comments that are specifically related to

authority or power or defending itself against claims made by the Buyer, the

any of the Buyers or its subsidiaries relationships with their vendors and
customers, except in the ordinary course of the Buyers or such subsidiarys
business.

 

(e) 

 

Each of the Buyer, the Seller and the Principal acknowledges and agrees that
the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.3 have been
negotiated in good faith by each of them. Each of the Buyer, the Seller and
the Principal further acknowledges that (i) the goodwill associated with the
existing Business, vendors, customers and assets of the Business prior to the
transactions contemplated herein is an integral component of the value of the
Business to the Buyer and is reflected in the consideration to be received by
the Seller and the Principal pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.3 are necessary to
preserve the value of the Business for the Buyer following the transaction.
Each of the Seller and Principal further acknowledges that the limitations of
time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in this Section 6.3 are
reasonable because, among other things: (A) the Buyer and the Seller are
engaged in a highly competitive industry and their operations are worldwide,
(B) the Seller and the Principal have unique access to, and will continue to
have access to, Confidential Information, including trade secrets, and know-
how of the Business, (C) the Seller and the Principal is receiving significant
consideration in connection with the transactions contemplated herein and (D)
this Section 6.3 provides no more protection than is necessary to protect the
Buyer\'s interest in the goodwill of the Business, Confidential Information
and trade secrets. If any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Section 6.3 shall be held to be excessively broad as to scope, territory or
period of time, such provisions shall be construed by limiting and reducing
them so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent allowed by applicable Law.

 

(f) 

 

Except as required by Law, each of the Seller and the Principal shall hold in
confidence all Confidential Information obtained in the course of its
ownership of or participation in, the Business (whether obtained prior to or
following the Closing Time) or otherwise which is either non-public,
confidential or proprietary in nature. Each of the Seller and the Principal
shall, subject to any requirement of Law, keep such Confidential Information
confidential and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, be
disclosed by it or him to any Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller or the Principal may disclose Confidential Information if and only to
the extent such disclosure (x) is reasonably necessary for the purpose of the
Seller or the Principal asserting its or his rights in a dispute among the
parties hereunder or under any Related Agreement or (y) is required in
connection with the preparation of a Tax Return or similar Tax-related filing.
The Seller and the Principal will use their best efforts to limit such
disclosure of the Confidential Information. It is acknowledged by the
Principal that, without limiting the foregoing, the policies and procedures of
the Buyer relating to confidentiality matters shall be complied with by the
Principal following the Closing Date.

 

(g) 

 

The Buyer shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and
specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this
Section 6.3. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies
for a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Seller or the Principal but shall be
in addition to all other remedies available at Law or equity (subject to the
provisions of Article IX). Failure or delay by the Buyer in exercising any
right, power or privilege under this Section 6.3 shall not operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement. Each
of the Seller and the Principal hereby waives any requirement that the Buyer
post a bond in connection with any claim for equitable relief.

status of the Rights Holder or in any of the other information provided on the
most recent letter, form, certificate or document previously delivered by the
Rights Holder to the Buyer hereunder. If the Buyer shall provide written

withholding Taxes from the payment due to such Rights Holder.

such Action (without prejudice to the Indemnitees right to seek
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX), _provided_ , that the Indemnitee
shall permit the Indemnitor to participate in the conduct of such Action
through counsel chosen by the Indemnitor, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor gives the
foregoing notice, subject to the first and second sentences of this Section
9.7, the Indemnitor shall have the right, at the sole expense of the
Indemnitor, to conduct and control, such Action with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the

permit the Indemnitee to participate in such conduct or settlement through
counsel chosen by the Indemnitee, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnitee, and (y) the Indemnitor may not compromise or
settle any such Action without the consent of the Indemnitee (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (i) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnitee or any violation by the
Indemnitee of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that
may be made against the Indemnitee, (ii) the sole relief provided is money
Damages that are paid in full by the Indemnitor, (iii) the Indemnitee shall
have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement and (iv) such
settlement includes an unconditional release in favor of the Indemnitee by the
third-party claimant from all liability with respect to such claim. In the
case of any third party Action as to which indemnification is sought by the
Indemnitee which involves a claim for Damages other than solely for money
Damages which could have a continuing effect on the business of the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall jointly control the
conduct of such Action. The parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts to minimize any Damages from claims by third parties and shall act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with such claims, notwithstanding any dispute as to liability under this
Article IX.
