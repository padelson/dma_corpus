part of Parent, Merger Sub Bio, TEI Bio, the holder of any Securities or the
holder of any shares of the capital stock of Merger Sub Bio:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub Bio_. Each issued and outstanding share of

converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Any share of capital stock of TEI Bio
that is owned by TEI Bio, as treasury stock or otherwise, shall be cancelled
such that it is no longer outstanding before the conversion described in
_Section 2.6(c)_ and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Capital Stock_. Each Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of the Common Certificate therefor (or, alternatively, a lost
certificate and indemnity agreement in accordance with  _Section 3.3(g)_), (
_i_ ) the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration and ( _ii_ ) any amounts that
may become payable in respect of such Common Share in the future from the
Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or from
the Merger Consideration adjustment set forth in _Section 3.5_.

(d) _Options_. Each Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall
be cancelled and each Optionholder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto other than, with respect to In-Money Options, the right to receive (
_i_ ) an amount in cash, equal to the product of ( _x_ ) the aggregate number
of Common Shares subject to such In-Money Option, multiplied by ( _y_ ) the
excess of the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price of such In-Money Option, and ( _ii_ ) any amounts that may
become payable in respect of such In-Money Option in the future from the
Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or from
the Merger Consideration adjustment set forth in _Section 3.5_. For the
avoidance of doubt, all Out-of-Money Options shall be cancelled and shall not
have any right to receive any consideration in respect thereof. Prior to the

Option in accordance with and as required by its respective terms, provide

that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time but
are held by a holder who is entitled to demand, and has properly exercised,
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (such Common Shares being
referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such rights under
applicable Law) shall not be converted into a right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_
, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses such rights granted by Section 262 of the DGCL under
applicable Law, such Common Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.6(c)_, without interest thereon. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist or
be outstanding, and, except as set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_, each
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto.

 

(b) _Parent Control_. TEI Bio shall provide to Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by TEI Bio for appraisal of Common Shares under Section 262
of the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other notice or
instrument delivered to TEI Bio prior to the Effective Time related thereto,
and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, TEI Bio shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

the SH Rep on all matters relating to this Agreement (including _ARTICLE 11_)

kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of any TEI Bio Securityholder by the SH Rep, and on any other action
taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any TEI Bio Securityholder by the
SH Rep, as being fully binding upon such Person. Notices or communications to
or from the SH Rep shall constitute notice to or from each of the TEI Bio
Securityholders. Any decision or action by the SH Rep hereunder, including any
agreement between the SH Rep and any Parent-Side Indemnified Person relating
to the defense, payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification
hereunder, shall constitute a decision or action of all TEI Bio
Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Person. No TEI Bio Securityholder shall have the right to object to, dissent
from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of this _Section
2.8_, including the power of attorney granted hereby, are independent and

SH Rep, a new SH Rep shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of the
Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent
appointing such new SH Rep shall be sent to Parent, such appointment to be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the date
such notice is received by Parent; _provided_ , that until such notice is
received, Parent, Merger Sub Bio and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions and actions of the prior SH Rep as described
in _Section 2.8(a)_ above.

 



19 (d) _Limits on Liability; Indemnification_. The SH Rep shall not be liable to
the TEI Bio Securityholders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross
negligence or to have involved fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel, accountants or other professionals and experts retained by the SH Rep
shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). The TEI Bio Securityholders
shall severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares),
indemnify and hold harmless the SH Rep from and against, compensate it for,
reimburse it for and pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements, arising out of and in connection with its activities as the SH
Rep under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the " _SH Rep Losses_ "),
in each case as such SH Rep Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that
if it is finally adjudicated that an SH Rep Loss or any portion thereof was
primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad
faith of the SH Rep, the SH Rep shall reimburse the TEI Bio Securityholder
for the amount of such indemnified SH Rep Loss attributable to such gross
negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith. The SH Rep Losses
shall be satisfied: ( _i_ ) from the SH Rep Expense Amount; and ( _ii_ ) to
the extent the amount of the SH Rep Losses exceeds amounts available to the SH
Rep under (i), from ( _a_ ) the TEI Bio Securityholders, severally and not
jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares) or ( _b_ ) the Escrow
Funds, to the extent such funds have been made available for distribution to
the TEI Bio Securityholders. As soon as practicable after the date on which
the final obligations of the SH Rep under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement have been discharged or such other date as the SH Rep deems
appropriate, the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the SH Rep
Expense Amount to the TEI Bio Securityholders in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares, as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

Common Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Common Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation shall issue or cause
to be issued to such Person the consideration deliverable in respect of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Common Certificate, determined and effected in
accordance with _Section 2.6_, _provided_ that the Person to whom the Merger

Excess_."

 



23 (b) _Review and Cooperation_. No later than one hundred twenty (120) days

the Independent Accountants determination be in an amount that is outside the
range of the disagreement between Parent and the SH Rep. Parent and the SH Rep
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountants to make such determination within thirty (30) days of such dispute
being referred to the Independent Accountants. The determination made by the
Independent Accountants shall be final and binding on the parties, absent
manifest error, and the cost of retaining the Independent Accountants for this

Accountants.

referred to herein as the " _Working Capital Deficit_ ". If it is determined
pursuant to this  _Section 3.5_ that ( _A_ ) Closing Working Capital, _plus_

Excess amount to the TEI Bio Securityholders entitled to receive Closing
Merger Consideration based on their Pro Rata Shares, subject to _Section
3.6_.

(iv) If it is determined pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ that neither clause

57 (b) _By Parent_. Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the TEI
Bio Securityholders, their Affiliates and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the " _Securityholder-Side Indemnified Persons_ "), from and
against, and pay or reimburse the Securityholder-Side Indemnified Persons for
any Losses incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or
incident to:

(i) subject to _Section 11.2(d)(ii)_, any breach of any representation or
warranty made by Parent in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub Bio pursuant to this
Agreement and any failure of any representation or warranty made by Parent in
this Agreement to be untrue as of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing
Date (except to the extent made as of a specified date) (it being agreed that
qualifications as to materiality or Material Adverse Change in any such
representation or warranty shall be taken into account in determining whether
there has been a breach of such representation or warranty but not in
calculating the amount of any related Losses); or

 

(ii) any breach of a covenant made by Parent in this Agreement.

 

(c) _Notices and Defense of Claims_. If a Claim for Losses (an " _Indemnity
Claim_ ") is made by a Person entitled to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Person shall give notice (an " _Indemnity Claim Notice_ ") to the
Indemnifying Person as promptly as practicable after the Person entitled to
indemnification becomes aware of any fact that may give rise to Losses for
which indemnification may be sought. If any Third-Party Claim in the form of a
lawsuit or arbitration demand is filed or made against any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder, an Indemnity Claim Notice with respect thereto
shall be given by the Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Person as
promptly as practicable. The Indemnity Claim Notice shall describe the
Indemnity Claim in reasonable detail. The failure of any Indemnified Person to
give timely notice under this _Section 11.2(c)_ shall not affect any
Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Person demonstrates actual damage caused by such failure. If,
within twenty (20) calendar days after its delivery of an Indemnity Claim
Notice to an Indemnifying Person, an Indemnified Person has not received a
written statement from the Indemnifying Person objecting to the Indemnity
Claim made therein, the indemnity obligation set forth therein shall be
deemed final and binding on the Indemnifying Person. Further procedures that
apply after such an Indemnity Claim Notice with respect to a Third-Party Claim
is given are set forth on _Schedule 11.2(c)_.

 

(d) _Limits on Liability_.

 

(i) _Limits on Liability of Stockholders or Optionholders_. Except with
respect to ( _A_ ) breaches of any Fundamental Representation or ( _B_ )
fraud by TEI Bio, the UK Subsidiary or any TEI Bio Securityholder (without
regard to non-survival of any representation) (each of clauses (A) and (B), an
" _Excluded Matter_ "), the TEI Bio Securityholders shall not have any
obligation to indemnify Parent-Side Indemnified Persons for Losses described
in _Section 11.2(a)(i)_, unless and until such Losses collectively suffered
or incurred by all Parent-Side Indemnified Persons exceed Two Million One
Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($2,110,000) (the " _Basket_ "), in which event
such indemnification obligations shall be for the amount of such Losses in
excess of One Million Fifty-Five Thousand Dollars ($1,055,000) up to a
maximum aggregate amount with respect to such indemnification obligations
equal to Twenty-One Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($21,100,000) (the "
_Cap_ ").

 

(ii) _Limits on Liability of Parent_. Except with respect to ( _A_ ) fraud by
Parent, or ( _B_ ) breaches of representations and warranties set forth in
Sections _5.1_ , _5.2_ or _5.5_ , Parent shall not be obligated to indemnify
Securityholder-Side Indemnified Persons for Losses described in _Section
11.2(b)(i)_ unless and until such Losses collectively suffered or incurred by

 



58  all TEI-Side Indemnified Persons exceed the Basket, in which event such
indemnification obligations shall be for the amount of such Losses in excess
of One Million Fifty-Five Thousand Dollars ($1,055,000), up to a maximum
aggregate amount with respect to such indemnification obligations equal to the
Cap.

(e) _Additional Limitations._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement:

(i) in the case of Excluded Matters, the aggregate amount of Losses for which
any TEI Bio Securityholder is obligated to provide indemnification under this
_ARTICLE 11_ in connection with any Excluded Matter (when aggregated with all
other Losses for which such TEI Bio Securityholder is obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder), excluding amounts taken from the Escrow Funds,
shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such
TEI Bio Securityholder;

 

(ii) no TEI Bio Securityholder shall have any liability for any fraud on the
part of any other TEI Bio Securityholder (except to the extent Parent is
otherwise entitled under this _ARTICLE 11_ to recover Losses resulting
therefrom from the then available Escrow Funds);

 

(iii) In no event shall any Indemnifying Person be responsible or liable for
any Losses or other amounts under this _ARTICLE 11_ that are ( _A_ )
punitive, except to the extent arising out of Third-Party Claims or ( _B_ )
claimed in an Indemnity Claim Notice with respect to a breach of
representation or warranty delivered hereunder after the expiration of
the applicable survival period of such representation or warranty set forth
in _Section 11.1_. Each party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses for which indemnification
is provided to it under this _ARTICLE 11_.

(iv) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_ARTICLE 11_ shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received by
the Indemnified Party under insurance policies (less any expenses incurred in
collecting such proceeds and any increase in premiums resulting from the claim
made therefor). If an Indemnified Person (or an Affiliate) receives any
insurance payment covering any Loss for which it has already received an
indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Person, it shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Person promptly for the amount of such insurance payment that
covers such Loss for which it has already received an indemnification payment.

(v) Parent shall not be entitled to make any claim for indemnification with
respect to the amount of any Loss that has been expressly taken into account
in the final Closing Working Capital, and the amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this _ARTICLE 11_ shall be calculated net
of any such amount expressly taken into account in determining any accruals,
reserves or provisions reflected in the final Closing Working Capital.

 

(f) _Certain Indemnification Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, ( _i_ ) the aggregate amount of Losses for which
any TEI Bio Securityholder is obligated to provide indemnification under
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ with respect to

 



59  any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.3_
relating to such TEI Bio Securityholders Securities set forth opposite such
TEI Bio Securityholders name in _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
or indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)(vi)_ (to the extent relating to
Encumbrances on such TEI Bio Securityholders Securities) shall not
be limited to such TEI Bio Securityholders Pro Rata Share of such Losses
(but total Losses for which such TEI Med Securityholder is obligated to
provide indemnification hereunder, excluding amounts taken from the Escrow
Funds, shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price actually received
by such TEI Bio Securityholder) and ( _ii_ ) the aggregate amount of Losses
for which any TEI Bio Securityholder is obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder for fraud on the part of such TEI Bio Securityholder shall not be
limited to such TEI Bio Securityholders Pro Rata Share of such Losses (but
total Losses for which such TEI Med Securityholder is obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder, excluding amounts taken from the Escrow Funds,
shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such
TEI Bio Securityholder).

(g)  _Subject Matter_. The rights and remedies of an Indemnified Person based
upon any inaccuracy or breach of any provisions of this Agreement shall in no
way be limited by the fact that the facts upon which such Indemnified Persons
claim is based may also be within the scope of a different provision of this
Agreement (including a provision as to which there is no inaccuracy for
breach).

 

(h) _Investigation_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, and the rights of indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto, shall not be affected by any investigation conducted, or knowledge
acquired or deemed acquired, by or on behalf of any party.

 

(i) _Sole Remedy_. In the absence of fraud (without regard to non-survival of
any representations hereunder), the rights accorded to each Parent-Side
Indemnified Person or Securityholder-Side Indemnified Person under this
_ARTICLE 11_ shall be the sole rights to money damages that any Person may
have under this Agreement or for breach of this Agreement, at common law
or otherwise, except as provided in the Support Agreement with respect to
Joint Securityholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _ARTICLE
11_ shall restrict or limit any rights that a Parent-Side Indemnified Person
or a Securityholder-Side Indemnified Person may have to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief to prevent a breach of this Agreement or to
specifically enforce this Agreement.

 

(j) _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 11_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

(k) _Indemnification from Escrow_. The Escrow Fund (Escrow Amount) shall be
available to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse any Parent-Side
Indemnified Person from any Losses indemnifiable under this _ARTICLE 11_. The
Escrow Fund (Additional Escrow Amount) shall be available to indemnify,
hold harmless and reimburse any Parent-Side Indemnified Person from any
Losses indemnifiable under _Item 4_ under _Schedule 11.2(a)(viii)_ and for
any Losses indemnifiable with respect to Excluded Matters under this _ARTICLE
11_. The Escrow Fund (Escrow Amount) (specifically excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Additional Escrow Amount), shall be the sole and
exclusive security and source of recovery of

 



60  the Parent-Side Indemnified Persons for the indemnification obligations of
the TEI Bio Securityholders under this Agreement for Losses described in
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_, except ( _i_ ) for any indemnification obligation
arising out of any Excluded Matter or ( _ii_ ) as provided in the Support
Agreement with respect to Joint Securityholders.

 

ARTICLE 12

COVENANTS AFTER CLOSING



     | 12.1 | _Publicity_ 
---|---|--- 

Parent and Merger Sub Bio, on the one hand, and TEI Bio on the other
hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any public statement without the prior consent of
the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may without the prior
consent of any other party, issue such a press release or other similar
public statement as may be required by applicable Law or the rules of a
national securities exchange or market on which the disclosing party is
listed, _provided_ , _further_ , that such disclosing party shall to the
extent reasonably practicable provide the other parties an opportunity to
review, and consult with the disclosing party with respect to, any such
release or statement prior to its release.

 



     | 12.2 | _Confidentiality_ 
---|---|--- 

(a) _TEI Bio Securityholders_. The TEI Bio Securityholders shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates (to whom they disclose any of the Confidential
Information described below in this clause (a)) and their respective
Representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of, and not use for any
purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
all Confidential Information obtained in contemplation or negotiation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and relating to Parent or its Affiliates,
except to the extent that disclosure of such information is required by
applicable Law, is authorized in writing by Parent or reasonably occurs in
connection with any dispute over the terms of this Agreement or any Additional
Agreement. In addition, from and after the Closing, the TEI
Bio Securityholders shall, and shall cause their Affiliates (to whom they
disclose any of the Confidential Information described above in this clause
(a)) and their respective Representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of,
and not use for any purpose, all Confidential Information of the Business,
except (i) as may be required by applicable Law, (ii) is authorized in writing
by Parent or (iii) reasonably occurs in connection with any dispute over the
terms of this Agreement or any Additional Agreement.

(b) _Parent_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their

(other than that relating to the Business or TEI Med), except to the extent
that disclosure of such information is required by applicable Law or the rules
of a national securities exchange or market on which such Person is listed or

any dispute over the terms of this Agreement or any Additional Agreement.

 



61 ---|---|--- 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a
"tail policy" (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") covering, for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, any Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of TEI Bio (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") and who is
currently covered by TEI Bios existing directors and officers liability
insurance or fiduciary liability insurance policies on terms no less
advantageous to such DandO Indemnified Persons than such existing insurance with
respect to matters occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time. The cost to purchase the DandO Tail Policy (the " _D andO Tail
Policy Cost_") shall be borne by the TEI Bio Securityholders by deducting such
amount from the Closing Merger Consideration.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless all past officers and directors of TEI Bio (the "
_Covered Parties_ ") to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to
the same limits as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by TEI Bio pursuant to the DGCL, TEI Bios certificate
of incorporation, TEI Bios by-laws and indemnification agreements between
TEI Bio and such Covered Parties for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing obligations shall only
apply to the extent covered by the DandO Tail Policy.

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 12.3_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Covered Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns ( _i_ )
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 12.3_.



     | 12.4 | _Tax Matters_ 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) TEI Bio shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of TEI Bio and the UK Subsidiary that are
required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the
Closing Date, and TEI Bio shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of TEI Bio
and the UK Subsidiary due on or before the Closing Date. At least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any extension)
for the filing of any such Tax Return that is an income Tax Return, TEI Bio
shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Parent for Parents review, and TEI
Bio shall consider in good faith any reasonable comment that Parent submits
to TEI Bio no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return.

 



62 (ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of TEI Bio and the UK Subsidiary that
relate to Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date but that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, and the Securityholders shall
indemnify Parent (in accordance with  _ARTICLE 11_ ) for all Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns. At least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
due date (taking into account any extension) for the filing of any such income
Tax Return, and at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date (taking
into account any extension) for the filing of any other such Tax Return,
Parent shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the SH Rep for the SH Reps
review. Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable comment that the
SH Rep submits to Parent no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due
date of such Tax Return.

 

(iii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of TEI Bio and the UK Subsidiary that are
required to be filed for a Straddle Period. At least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the due date (taking into account any extension) for the filing of
any such Tax Return, Parent shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the SH
Rep for the SH Reps review. Parent shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comment relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period that the SH Rep
submits to Parent no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of
such Tax Return.

(iv) With respect to Taxes of TEI Bio or the UK Subsidiary relating to a
Straddle Period, the Securityholders shall indemnify Parent (in accordance
with _ARTICLE 11_ ) for the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date. The amount of
Taxes relating to a Straddle Period that is allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (A) in the
case of property Taxes and other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B)
in the case of all other Taxes (other than Taxes covered by _Section 3.7_),
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. For purposes of computing the Taxes attributable
to the two portions of the Straddle Period pursuant to this _Section
12.4(a)(iv)_, the amount of any item that is taken into account only once for
each Tax Period (e.g., the benefit of graduated Tax rates, exemption amounts)
shall be allocated between the two portions of the Straddle Period in
proportion to the number of days in each portion. For the avoidance of doubt,
the amount of any Tax of TEI Bio under Section 951(a) of the Code that is
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the
Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books of
the UK Subsidiary as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the Tax Period of the UK Subsidiary shall be deemed
to terminate at such time). Any transactions that occur on the Closing Date
but after the Closing and that are not incurred in the ordinary course of
business of TEI Bio or the UK Subsidiary (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) shall be considered allocable to a Post-
Closing Tax Period.

(v) All Tax Returns described in this _Section 12.4(a)_, to the extent
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be prepared in accordance with
past custom and practice of TEI Bio and the UK Subsidiary in preparing their
Tax Returns, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



63 (b) _Cooperation_. Parent and the SH Rep agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes of TEI Bio and the UK Subsidiary,
including, without limitation, access to books and records, as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by Parent or the SH Rep, the
preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Each of Parent
and the SH Rep shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes of
TEI Bio and the UK Subsidiary for a period of at least seven (7) years
following the Closing Date.

(c) _Notice of Tax Claims_. If a Governmental Authority shall commence any
audit, examination or other proceeding or make any claim relating to Taxes
that, if successful, might result in an indemnification payment pursuant to
_Section 11.2_ (a " _Tax Claim"_ ), Parent shall promptly give written
notice of such Tax Claim to the SH Rep, together with copies of all notices
and communications relating to such Tax Claim; provided, however, that the
failure of Parent to give such notice shall only relieve the Securityholders
from their indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent the
Securityholders demonstrate actual and material damage caused by such failure.

 

(d) _Control of Tax Claims_. The SH Rep shall, upon written notification to
Parent, control all proceedings at its own expense and may make all decisions
with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or before the
Closing Date; provided that the SH Rep shall not settle any such Tax Claim
without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) if the resolution of such Tax
Claim reasonably could be expected to affect the Tax liability of TEI Bio or
the UK Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period. The SH Rep and Parent shall
jointly control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a
Straddle Period, and any such Tax Claim shall not be settled without the prior
written consent of both the SH Rep and Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed). If the SH Rep declines to assume the
defense of any Tax Claim that it is entitled to control and defend pursuant to
this _Section 12.4(d)_ after receipt of notice thereof, or if SH Rep is not
entitled to control or defend any Tax Claim pursuant to this _Section
12.4(d)_, Parent shall thereupon have the right to undertake the control,
defense and settlement of such Tax Claim; _provided_ that Parent shall not
settle any such Tax Claim without SH Reps prior written consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this _Section 12.4(d)_, on the one hand,
and _Section 11.2(c)_, on the other hand, with respect to any Tax Claim, the
provisions of this _Section 12.4(d)_ shall control.

(e) _Refunds_. The TEI Bio Securityholders shall be entitled to any refunds
(including any interest paid thereon) or credits in lieu of refunds of Taxes
of TEI Bio or the UK Subsidiary attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
net of any reasonable cost to Parent or its subsidiaries attributable to the
obtaining and receipt of such refund, provided that (1) such Taxes were paid
by TEI Bio or the UK Subsidiary at or prior to the Closing or by a TEI Bio
Securityholder at or after the Closing, and (2) such refund does not arise as
a result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit from a Post-Closing Tax
Period. Parent and its Affiliates

 



64  shall reasonably cooperate with the SH Rep in obtaining any refund or credit
to which the TEI Bio Securityholders are entitled under this _Section
12.4(e)_. Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall promptly forward to or
reimburse the TEI Bio Securityholders for any such refunds (including any
interest paid thereon) or credits due to the TEI Bio Securityholders after
receipt thereof. To the extent such refund or credit is subsequently
disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Taxing Authority, the
TEI Bio Securityholders shall promptly repay the amount of such refund,
together with any interest imposed by such Taxing Authority and any penalties
or additional amounts imposed by such Taxing Authority that are attributable
to any action of the TEI Bio Securityholders, to Parent.

(f)  _No Section 336(e) or 338 Election_. Parent agrees that it will not
make any election under Sections 336(e) or 338 of the Code, or any comparable
election under state or local law, with respect to the acquisition of TEI Bio
or the UK Subsidiary.

(g) _Post-Closing Actions_. Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit
TEI Bio, the UK Subsidiary, or any Affiliate to) file, amend, re-file or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election relating in whole or in part
to TEI Bio or the UK Subsidiary or agree to the waiver or any extension of the
statute of limitations, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without
the prior written consent of the SH Rep (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).



     | 12.5 | _Products Liability Insurance_. 
---|---|--- 

Parent shall purchase and keep in place for a period of not less than three
(3) years after the Effective Time a successor products liability insurance
plan with a liability limit of not less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000)
naming each of TEI Bio and TEI Med as named insureds.

respective successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in

(c) _Choice of Law, Jurisdiction, Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall
be construed, governed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally: ( _i_ ) agrees that any dispute arising out
of this Agreement may be brought in any Chancery Court in the State of
Delaware, ( _ii_ ) consents to such jurisdiction; ( _iii_ ) waives any
objection to such venue and ( _iv_ ) waives trial by jury in any Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d)  _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties could be irreparably harmed if any provision of this Agreement
is not performed in accordance with its specific terms and that any breach of
this Agreement by a party could not be

 



66  adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly,
each party agrees that, in addition to any other right or remedy to which the
other parties may be entitled at law or in equity, each party shall be
entitled to seek to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance and to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches, without posting
any bond or giving any other undertaking.

(e) _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers; Assignment_. This Agreement and
the Additional Agreements, together with all schedules hereto and thereto
(including the Disclosure Schedule) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution
of this Agreement but, if the Closing occurs, be superseded in its entirety
effective as of the Closing. This Agreement may only be amended, modified,
supplemented or assigned by ( _i_ ) prior to the Effective Time, by an
agreement in writing signed by Parent, Merger Sub Bio and TEI Bio, or ( _ii_ )
after the Effective Time, an agreement in writing signed by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, on one hand, and the SH Rep (on behalf of the TEI Bio
Securityholders) on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each
case, after Stockholder Approval of the Merger is obtained, there shall be no
amendment, waiver or assignment that, pursuant to applicable Law, requires
further approval of the Stockholders, without the receipt of such further
approvals. Any failure of Parent or Merger Sub Bio, on the one hand, or TEI
Bio on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived prior to the Closing by TEI Bio, and after the
Closing by the SH Rep (with respect to any failure by Parent or Merger Sub
Bio) or by Parent or Merger Sub Bio (with respect to any failure by TEI Bio),
respectively, only by a written instrument signed by such party granting such
waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

(f) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A manual signature on
this Agreement or any other document to be delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, an image of which shall been transmitted electronically, will
constitute an original signature for all purposes.

(g)  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement
or in any Additional Agreement, each party shall pay its own legal, accounting
and out-of-pocket and other expenses incident to the negotiation and execution
of, and Closing under, this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Transaction Expenses described under subclause (a) of such definition shall be
paid as contemplated by _ARTICLE 3_.

 

(h) _Invalidity and Severability_. If any provision contained in this
Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, then,
to the maximum extent permitted by Law, such invalidity or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement. Should any portion,
provision or clause of this Agreement be deemed too broad to permit
enforcement to its full extent then it shall be enforced to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, and the parties consent and agree that such scope may
be judicially modified accordingly in any Proceeding brought to enforce such
portion, provision or clause.

 



67 (i) _Cumulative Remedies_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, all rights and remedies of any party are cumulative of each other
and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at Law or in
equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice
or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.

(j) _Incorporation of Schedules_. The schedules (including the Disclosure
Schedule) that are attached to this Agreement are a part of this Agreement
and are incorporated herein by reference.

(k) _Further Assurances_. Without limiting any other obligation hereunder,
each party shall upon request execute and deliver to any other party such
other documents, and do such other acts and things, including filing any
forms, notifications or reports with Governmental Authorities, in each case
as such requesting party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying
out the intent of this Agreement, the Additional Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(l) _Attorney-Client Privilege; Future Representation; Parties Other than TEI
Bio_. Parent and Merger Sub Bio hereby acknowledge that Wilmer Cutler
Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (" _WilmerHale_ ") has acted as counsel to TEI Bio
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The following
provisions apply to the attorney-client relationship between ( _i_ ) TEI Bio
and WilmerHale prior to Closing and ( _ii_ ) the TEI Bio Securityholders (and
any subset of them) and WilmerHale following Closing. Each TEI Bio
Securityholder hereby agrees that it will not seek to disqualify WilmerHale
from acting as counsel to any of the TEI Bio Securityholders either in the
event of a dispute hereunder or in the course of the defense or prosecution of
any claim relating to the transactions contemplated herein because of
its representation of TEI Bio in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein. Parent and Merger Sub Bio agree that the TEI Bio
Securityholders who are employees of TEI Bio have a reasonable expectation of
privacy with respect to their communications (including any e-mail
communications using the e-mail system of TEI Bio) with WilmerHale prior to
the Closing to the extent such communications concern the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub Bio further agree that
for the purposes of the attorney-client privilege, any communications between
WilmerHale and TEI Bio or the TEI Bio Securityholders who are employees of TEI
Bio that were made in the course of negotiating the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that relate to the subject matter of th is Agreement or
that may be relevant to any claims for indemnification under this Agreement or
any other dispute arising in connection with this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document executed or delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby (" _Protected
Communications_ ") shall be deemed privileged communications of the TEI Bio
Securityholders who are employees of TEI Bio for the purposes of such claims
or disputes, and to the extent that they may not be considered as such at law,
Parent and Merger Sub Bio hereto agree to contractually treat such Protected
Communications as if they were privileged communications of the TEI Bio
Securityholders who are employees of TEI Bio.
