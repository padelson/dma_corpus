AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION 

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 11, 2002, is by and among Univision Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Univision"), Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("HBC"), and Univision Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Univision ("Merger Sub"). 

  

RECITALS

  

 A. HBC and Univision have determined to engage in a business combination whereby Merger Sub will be merged with and into HBC, with HBC continuing as the surviving corporation of such merger and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Univision. 

   

 B. The respective boards of directors of HBC, Univision and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger (as defined below). 

  

 C. To induce Univision to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of HBC have executed a stockholder support agreement ("HBC Stockholder Support Agreement") with Univision in the form of _Exhibit A_. 

  

 D. To induce HBC to enter into this Agreement, the principal stockholder of Univision has executed a stockholder support agreement ("Univision Stockholder Support Agreement") with HBC in the form of _Exhibit B_. 

  

 E. For United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. 

  

ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  

 1.1 _ The Merger._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to the provisions of Section 1.12 of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 below), Merger Sub will be merged with and into HBC, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and with the effect provided therein (collectively with the Forward Merger (as defined in Section 1.12), the "Merger"). HBC shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Univision and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Forward Merger is necessitated pursuant to Section 1.12, at the Effective Time, HBC will be merged with and into Merger Sub, in accordance with the DGCL and with the effect provided therein. In such case, Merger Sub will be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of Univision and the separate corporate existence of HBC will cease. 

  

 1.2 _ Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing an appropriate certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.3 below). The Merger will become effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as is provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

  

 1.3 _ Closing of the Merger._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties, which will be no later than the last business day of the month in which the conditions set forth in ARTICLE V (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied or waived (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of O\'Melveny and Myers LLP, 1999 Avenue of the Stars, Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to another time, date or place in writing.   

 1.4 _ Effects of the Merger._ The Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of HBC and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of HBC and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.5 _ Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of HBC shall be amended in the Merger to read in their entirety as set forth on _Exhibits C_ and _D_ hereto, and, as so amended will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until respectively amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law; provided, however, that in the event that the Forward Merger is effected pursuant to Section 1.1, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until respectively amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law, except that the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub shall be amended to reflect a change of the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation." 

  

 1.6 _ Directors._ The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such director\'s successor is duly elected and qualified. 

  

 1.7 _ Officers._ The officers of HBC as of the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation until any such officer\'s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

 1.8 _ Conversion of Shares._ 

   

 (a) Subject to Section 1.8(c), Section 1.10(c), Section 1.11 and Section 1.12, at the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each issued and outstanding share of Class A Common Stock, $.001 par value of HBC ("HBC Class A Common Stock") and each issued and outstanding share of Class B Common Stock, $.001 par value of HBC ("HBC Class B Common Stock" and together with the HBC Class A Common Stock, the "HBC Stock"), will convert into the right to receive .85 of a share of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value of Univision ("Univision Class A Stock"); provided, however, that in the event that a Forward Merger is effected pursuant to Section 1.1, (x) each issued and outstanding share of HBC Class A Common Stock will convert into the right to receive .85 of a share of Univision Class A Common Stock and (y) each issued and outstanding share of HBC Class B Common Stock will convert into the right to receive .85 of a share of Class B Common Stock, $.01 par value, of Univision (the "Univision Class B Stock" and collectively with the Univision Class A Stock, the "Univision Stock"). The amount of Univision Stock to be received for each share of HBC Stock, the "Merger Consideration" and the ratio of Univision Stock to be received for each share of HBC Stock, the "Exchange Ratio." 

  

 (b) As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock will convert into one share of HBC Class A Common Stock; provided, however, that in the event that the Forward Merger is effected pursuant to Section 1.1, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 1.8 to the contrary, each share of HBC Stock issued and held in HBC\'s treasury immediately before the Effective Time, and each share of HBC Stock held by Univision, Merger Sub, any other Subsidiary of Univision or any Subsidiary of HBC immediately before the Effective Time, will, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and will be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor. 

  

 1.9 _ Exchange Procedure._ 

     

 (a) Promptly following the Closing Date, Univision will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with Bank of New York (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates (or other evidence of ownership) representing the shares of HBC Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (collectively "HBC Certificates"), certificates (or other evidence of ownership) representing the shares of Univision Stock ("Univision Certificates") to be issued in accordance with this ARTICLE I (the "Exchange Fund"). 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of HBC Stock immediately before the Effective Time (excluding any shares of HBC Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 1.8(c)): 

  

  

 (1) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the HBC Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of such HBC Certificates to the Exchange Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Univision specifies), and 

  

 (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the HBC Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of HBC Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the holder of record of HBC Stock, it will be a condition to such payment that the HBC Certificate(s) so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (with the signature or signatures thereof guaranteed to the extent required by the Letter of Transmittal) and that the Person requesting such payment will pay to the Exchange Agent any taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such HBC Certificate(s) or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) Upon surrender of an HBC Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as Univision or the Exchange Agent reasonably request, the holder of such HBC Certificate will be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable in exchange therefor a Univision Certificate representing that number of shares of Univision Stock, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE I, and the HBC Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.9, each HBC Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of HBC Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

 1.10 _ Dividends, Fractional Shares, Etc._ 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time on Univision Stock will be paid with respect to any shares of Univision Stock issuable upon surrender of an HBC Certificate, until such HBC Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided in this Agreement. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such HBC Certificate, there will be paid to the holder of the Univision Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, 

  

  

 (1) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect to such whole shares of Univision Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and 

  

 (2) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but before surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Univision Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon. 

  

    
 

  

 (b) At or after the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Surviving Corporation of the shares of HBC Stock, which were outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, HBC Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE I. HBC Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of HBC for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), will not be exchanged until Univision has received a written agreement from such person as provided in Section 4.11. 

  

 (c) No fractional shares (and no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares) of Univision Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of Univision Stock pursuant to the Merger, cash adjustments will be paid to holders in respect of any fractional share of Univision Stock that would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment will be equal to the product of such fractional amount and the average of the last reported sales price per share of Univision Class A Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the five trading days immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any shares of Univision Stock) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of HBC six months after the Effective Time will be delivered to Univision. Any former stockholder of HBC who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE I will thereafter look only to Univision for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Univision Stock deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, the Exchange Fund shall be payable to Univision upon its request. 

  

 (e) None of Univision, HBC, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person will be liable to any former holder of shares of HBC Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) If any HBC Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such HBC Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Univision, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Univision may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such HBC Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed HBC Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Univision Stock, if any, as provided in this Section 1.10, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 1.11 _ Exchange Ratio Adjustments._ 

   

 (a) If Univision changes the number of shares of Univision Class A Common Stock or Univision Class B Common Stock (if any) issued and outstanding before the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar recapitalization with respect to such stock and record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be before the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. 

  

 (b) If, before the Effective Time, Univision shall consummate a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other reorganization, or any other transaction with another person pursuant to which the holders of Univision Class A Common Stock receive or become entitled to receive securities, cash or other assets or any combination thereof, each holder of HBC Stock shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time for each share of HBC Stock, that amount of securities, cash or other assets that such holder would have received or become entitled to receive had such holder been the record holder of 

     

 the number of shares of Univision Stock issuable to such holder of HBC Stock
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) had the Effective Time occurred immediately before
the consummation of such transaction; provided, however, that if the
consideration in such merger, consolidation, share exchange or other
reorganization causes the attribution of the combined entity\'s FCC licenses
to any holder of HBC Class B Stock, such holder shall be entitled to receive
non-voting securities of such combined entity or such other consideration
necessary for such FCC licenses to not be attributable to such holder.

  

 1.12 _ Restructure of Transaction._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to the Effective Time, the FCC (as defined below) determines that the holders of HBC Class B Common Stock will have an attributable interest in Univision under the Federal Communications Act or any of its rules or regulations at or following the Effective Time, then the Merger shall be effected pursuant to a merger of HBC with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the Surviving Corporation (the "Forward Merger"). The parties agree to take all reasonable actions, including amending this Agreement and executing any certificates, agreements or instruments necessary in order to effect the intended purposes of this Section 1.12. In addition, Univision shall have added to its conditions in Section 5.3 the receipt of a written opinion of O\'Melveny and Myers LLP, special counsel to Univision, based upon the representation letters described in Section 5.2(c) and dated the Closing Date, substantially to the effect of the opinions set forth in Section 5.2(c)(3), substituting in clause (c) "Univision, HBC and Merger Sub" for "stockholders of HBC" and deleting the parenthetical clause in clause (c)(3). 

  

ARTICLE II

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HBC

  

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered at or before the execution of this Agreement to Univision (the "HBC Disclosure Letter") or in the HBC Reports (as defined below)(which disclosures shall be deemed to qualify each representation and warranty, as applicable, notwithstanding any specific Section or Schedule reference or lack thereof if it is manifestly evident that it applies to such other section as well), HBC represents and warrants to Univision as follows: 

  

 2.1 _ Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority._ HBC is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. HBC is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of any other state of the United States in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have a material long-term adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of HBC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than as a result of (i) changes in general U.S. economic conditions or capital markets, (ii) changes generally affecting the radio, television or advertising industries, (iii) cyclical changes or other short term changes of the business, results of operations or financial condition of HBC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) changes attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger or the Transactions and (v) changes in the market price or trading volume of HBC Class A Common Stock (an "HBC Material Adverse Effect")). HBC has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and carry on its business as now conducted. Each of HBC\'s Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 7.14) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. 

     

 The copies of HBC\'s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws previously made
available to Univision are true and correct.

  

 2.2 _ Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements._ HBC has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all agreements and documents contemplated hereby. Subject only to the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions") by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of HBC Class A Common Stock and by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of HBC Class B Common Stock, the consummation by HBC of the Transactions has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement constitutes, and all agreements and documents contemplated hereby (when executed and delivered pursuant hereto for value received) will constitute, the valid and legally binding obligations of HBC, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general principles of equity. 

  

 2.3 _ Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of HBC consists of 175,000,000 shares of HBC Class A Common Stock, $.001 par value, 50,000,000 shares of HBC Class B Common Stock, $.001 par value, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value (the "HBC Preferred Stock"). As of May 1, 2002, there were 80,395,972 shares of HBC Class A Common Stock, 28,312,940 shares of HBC Class B Common Stock and no shares of HBC Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. Since such date, 

  

 (a) no additional shares of capital stock of HBC have been issued, except pursuant to the terms existing on the date of this Agreement of HBC\'s Long-Term Incentive Plan and HBC\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "HBC Stock Plans") and 

   

 (b) no options or other rights to acquire shares of HBC\'s capital stock have been granted (other than an aggregate of 5,761,251 options to acquire HBC Class A Common Stock granted pursuant to the terms existing on the date of this Agreement of the HBC Stock Plans). No award agreement covering options granted since 1998 permits the right to a stock appreciation right upon the change of control caused by the Merger. An example of each form of award agreement executed pursuant to the HBC Stock Plans has been delivered previously to Univision. HBC has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of HBC on any matter. All issued and outstanding shares of HBC Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Other than as set forth above or as listed on the HBC Disclosure Letter, there are not at the date of this Agreement any existing options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities, or other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate HBC or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock of HBC or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 2.4 _ Subsidiaries._ HBC owns directly or indirectly each of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such HBC Subsidiary) of each of HBC\'s Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or other encumbrances other than liens imposed by local law which are not material. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of HBC\'s corporate Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, each of the outstanding partnership interests of each HBC Subsidiary that is a partnership has been duly authorized by such partnership and each of the outstanding limited liability company interests of each HBC Subsidiary that is a limited liability company has been duly authorized by such limited liability company. The following information for each Subsidiary of HBC has been previously provided to Univision, if requested and if applicable:

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by HBC do not, and the consummation by HBC of the Transactions will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (each a "Governmental Entity") or self-regulatory organization, except

 2.7 _ Compliance._ HBC and each HBC Subsidiary is in compliance with 

   

 (a) all laws, rules, regulations, orders, judgments and decrees applicable to HBC or any HBC Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of HBC or any HBC Subsidiary is bound or affected, and 

  

 (b) all Contracts to which HBC or any HBC Subsidiary is a party or by which HBC or any HBC Subsidiary or any property or asset of HBC or any HBC Subsidiary is bound or affected, 

  

in each case except where failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries
have obtained all licenses, permits and other authorizations and have taken
all actions required by applicable law or governmental regulations in
connection with their business as now conducted, except where the failure to
obtain any such item or to take any such action would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, an HBC Material Adverse Effect. HBC and the HBC
Subsidiaries that are FCC licensees are financially qualified, and to
the Knowledge (as defined in Section 7.9) of HBC, are otherwise qualified to
be FCC licensees. HBC is not aware of any facts or circumstances with respect
to its or any HBC Subsidiary\'s assets, operations or FCC licenses that might
prevent or delay any necessary FCC approval of the Transactions, other than
the need to obtain waivers from the FCC of its multiple ownership rules.

  

 2.8 _ SEC Documents._ 

   

 (a) HBC has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") since December 31, 1999 (collectively, the "HBC Reports"). As of their respective dates, the HBC Reports and any such reports, forms and other documents filed by HBC with the SEC after the date of this Agreement 

  

  

 (1) complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder and 

  

 (2) did not, or will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

  

The representation in clause (2) of the preceding sentence shall not apply to
any misstatement or omission in any HBC Report filed before the date of this
Agreement which was superseded by a subsequent HBC Report filed before the
date of this Agreement. No HBC Subsidiary is required to file any report, form
or other document with the SEC.

     (b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets of HBC included in or
incorporated by reference into any HBC Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of HBC and
the HBC Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements
of income, retained earnings and cash flows of HBC included in
or incorporated by reference into any HBC Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of operations, retained
earnings or cash flows, as the case may be, of HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which would not be material
in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein. Neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or
reserved against in, a consolidated balance sheet of HBC or in the notes
thereto, prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, except for

  

  

 (1) liabilities or obligations that were so reserved on, or reflected in (including the notes to), the consolidated balance sheet of HBC as of December 31, 2001; 

  

 (2) liabilities or obligations arising in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2001; and 

  

 (3) liabilities or obligations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  

 2.9 _ Litigation._ There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or other proceedings pending against HBC or any HBC Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of HBC, threatened against HBC or any HBC Subsidiary, at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state or municipal court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, that could reasonably be expected to have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. Neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary is subject to any settlement agreement, conciliation agreement, letter of commitment, deficiency letter, consent decree or other order of any federal, state or municipal court, commission, board, agency or instrumentality that could reasonably be expected to have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 2.10 _ Absence of Certain Changes._ Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2001, there has not been 

  

 (a) any HBC Material Adverse Effect or any circumstance or event that could reasonably be expected to have an HBC Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (b) any circumstance or event that would have been prohibited by Section 4.2(a) if the terms of such section had been in effect as of such date. 

   

 2.11 _ Taxes._ 

  

 (a) Each of HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries has filed all material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it, or requests for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed and granted and have not expired, and all tax returns and reports are complete and accurate in all material respects. HBC and each HBC Subsidiary has paid (or HBC has paid on its behalf) all taxes shown as due on such tax returns and reports. The most recent financial statements contained in the HBC Reports reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements and no liabilities for taxes have been incurred by HBC or any HBC Subsidiary subsequent to such date other than in the ordinary course of its business. No deficiencies for any material amount of taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against HBC or any HBC Subsidiary. No requests for waivers of the time to assess any taxes against HBC or any HBC Subsidiary have been granted or are pending, except 

     

 for requests with respect to such taxes that have been adequately reserved
for in the most recent financial statements contained in the HBC Reports.

   

 (b) Neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary has taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of by Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 (c) Except as previously disclosed to Univision, neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary has entered into any compensatory agreement, plan or arrangement covering any person as to which payment or vesting thereunder (including any payment or vesting as a result of the Merger) could result in a nondeductible expense by reason of Section 280G of the Code. 

   

 (d) Neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary is liable for the taxes of any person (other than another current member of the HBC consolidated group), including, without limitation, as a result of the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6, any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law, or as a result of any contractual arrangement with any third party or with any taxing authority. 

  

 (e) Neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary constitutes either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) with respect to a distribution of shares qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) that could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Transactions. 

  

 (f) As used in this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise, "taxes" shall include all Federal, state, local and foreign income, franchise, property, sales, use, excise or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever, including obligations for withholding taxes from payments due or made to any other person and any interest, penalties or additions to tax. 

  

 2.12 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ 

   

 (a) Section 2.12 of the HBC Disclosure Letter provides a complete and accurate description of each of the following that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to by HBC or any HBC Subsidiary for the benefit of its employees, or has been so sponsored, maintained or contributed to within six years prior to the Effective Time for the benefit of such individuals: each "employee benefit plan," as such term is defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, (including, but not limited to, employee benefit plans, such as foreign plans, which are not subject to the provisions of ERISA), and each personnel policy, stock option plan, stock purchase plan, stock appreciation rights plan, phantom stock plan, collective bargaining agreement, bonus plan or arrangement, incentive award plan or arrangement, vacation policy, severance pay plan, policy or agreement, deferred compensation agreement or arrangement, executive compensation or supplemental income arrangement, consulting agreement, employment agreement and each other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement, program, practice or understanding (collectively, "HBC Employee Benefit Plans"); 

  

 (b) True, correct and complete copies of each of the HBC Employee Benefit Plans have been furnished to Univision. The execution of this Agreement, and performance of the Transactions, will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any benefit plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee; 

  

 (c) Except as would not have an HBC Material Adverse Effect, all HBC Employee Benefit Plans are in compliance with all applicable requirements of law, including ERISA and the Code; 

     

 (d) Except as would not have an HBC Material Adverse Effect, neither HBC nor any HBC Subsidiary or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is or was a member of a group of which HBC is a member and which is or was under common control with HBC within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code ("HBC ERISA Affiliate") maintains or contributes to (or has maintained or contributed to in the last six years) any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, and there are no outstanding claims, or to the Knowledge of HBC, any threatened claims, with respect to any benefits under the employee benefit plans (other than routine claims for benefits); and 

   

 (e) Except as required under Section 4980B of the Code, neither HBC, nor any HBC Subsidiary or HBC ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to provide health benefits to any employee following termination of employment. 

  

 2.13 _ Labor Matters._ There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements that pertain to HBC or any HBC Subsidiary, either pending or being negotiated. HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries have not agreed to recognize any labor union or other collective bargaining representative, nor has any labor union or other collective bargaining representative been certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of any employees of HBC or any HBC Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of HBC, there is no union organizing effort pending or threatened against HBC or any HBC Subsidiary. There is no labor strike, labor dispute, work slowdown, stoppage or lockout actually pending, or to the Knowledge of HBC, threatened against or affecting HBC or any HBC Subsidiary, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of HBC, threatened against HBC or any HBC Subsidiary relating to its business, except for any such proceeding, which would not have an HBC Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 2.14 _ No Brokers._ HBC has not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation of HBC or Univision to pay any finder\'s fees, brokerage or agent\'s commissions or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except that HBC has retained Credit Suisse First Boston as its financial advisor, the arrangements with which have been disclosed in writing to Univision before the date of this Agreement. Other than the foregoing arrangements, HBC is not aware of any claim for payment of any finder\'s fees, brokerage or agent\'s commissions or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. 

  

 2.15 _ Opinion of Financial Advisor._ HBC has received the opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the holders of HBC Class A Common Stock from a financial point of view, a copy of which has been provided to Univision. HBC has been authorized by Credit Suisse First Boston to include such opinion in its entirety in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

All leases to which HBC or any HBC Subsidiary is a party are valid and binding and no default has occurred or is continuing thereunder, which would result in an HBC Material Adverse Effect. HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases to which any of them is a party as lessee with such 

     

 exceptions as do not materially interfere with the use made by HBC or such
Subsidiary. There are no material liens on any of the assets of HBC or any HBC
Subsidiary that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to
pay any Taxes when due.

The board of directors of HBC has passed the resolutions contained in Section 2.19 of the HBC Disclosure Letter with the intent to exempt the conversion of the shares of HBC Stock at the Effective Time held by the officers and directors of HBC into the right to receive shares of Univision Stock as a result of the conversion of shares in the Merger (including shares issuable upon exercise of options) from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 2.20 _ Airplay._ To the Knowledge of HBC, no direct or indirect payments have been made to any past or present executive or employee of HBC or any HBC Subsidiary to influence airplay without disclosing such payment to its listeners. To the Knowledge of HBC, there has not been any governmental investigation, inquiry, disciplinary action or fine regarding any payments relating to airplay with respect to any broadcast station ("Station") directly or indirectly controlled by HBC.

ARTICLE III

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF UNIVISION and MERGER SUB

  

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered at or before the execution of this Agreement to HBC (the "Univision Disclosure Letter") or in the Univision Reports (as defined below) (which disclosures shall be deemed to qualify each representation and warranty, as applicable, notwithstanding any specific Section or Schedule reference or lack thereof if it is manifestly evident that it applies to such other section as well), Univision and Merger Sub each represents and warrants to HBC as follows: 

  

 3.1 _ Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority._ Univision is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Univision is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of any other state of the United States in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have a material long-term adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Univision and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than as a result of (i) changes in general U.S. economic conditions or capital markets, (ii) changes generally affecting the television, radio or advertising industries, (iii) cyclical changes or other short term changes of the business, results of operations or financial condition of Univision and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) changes attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger or the Transactions and (v) changes in the market price or trading volume of Univision Class A Common Stock (a "Univision Material Adverse Effect")). Univision has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and carry on its business as now conducted. Each of Univision\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. The copies of Univision\'s and Merger Sub\'s Certificates of Incorporation and bylaws previously made available to HBC are true and correct. 

  

 3.2 _ Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements._ 

  

 (a) Univision has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all agreements and documents contemplated hereby. Subject only to the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to create Univision Class B Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and the approval of the issuance of Univision Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, each as contemplated hereby, by the holders of the shares of Univision capital stock representing a majority of the votes cast at the meeting of stockholders held by Univision pursuant to Section 4.3, the consummation by Univision of the Transactions has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement constitutes, and all agreements and documents contemplated hereby (when executed and delivered pursuant hereto for value received) will constitute, the valid and legally binding obligations of Univision, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable 

     

 bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors\' rights and general principles of equity.

  

 (b) Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all agreements and documents contemplated hereby. The consummation by Merger Sub of the Transactions has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement constitutes, and all agreements and documents contemplated hereby (when executed and delivered pursuant hereto for value received) will constitute, the valid and legally binding obligations of Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general principles of equity. 

  

 3.3 _ Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of Univision consists of 492,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value (the "Univision Preferred Stock"). The Univision Common Stock is divided into four classes: Class A Common Stock, of which 300,000,000 is authorized, Class P Common Stock, of which 96,000,000 is authorized, Class T Common Stock, of which 48,000,000 is authorized, and Class V Common Stock of which 48,000,000 is authorized.

Since such date, no additional shares of capital stock of Univision have been issued except pursuant to Univision\'s 1996 Performance Award Plan (the "Univision Stock Plan"). Univision has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Univision on any matter (other than the Class A Warrants, the Class T Warrants and the Class V Warrants described in Univision\'s Reports). All such issued and outstanding shares of Univision capital stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed above, there are not at the date of this Agreement any existing options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities, or other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate Univision or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock of Univision or any of its Subsidiaries (other than under the Univision Stock Plan). 

  

 3.4 _ Subsidiaries._ Univision owns directly or indirectly each of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such Univision Subsidiary) of each of Univision\'s Subsidiaries and of Merger Sub, free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or other encumbrances other than liens imposed by local law which are not material. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Univision\'s corporate Subsidiaries and Merger Sub is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each of the outstanding partnership interests of each Univision Subsidiary that is a partnership has been duly authorized by such partnership. The following information for each Subsidiary of Univision has been previously made available to HBC, if requested and if applicable:

 (b) its authorized capital stock or share capital; and 

  

 (c) the number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, share capital, partnership interests or limited liability company interests.

 3.6 _ No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._ 

     

 (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Univision do not, and the consummation by Univision of the Transactions will not, 

  

  

 (1) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of 

    

 (i) Univision or 

  

 (ii) any Univision Subsidiary,

 (3) subject to making the filings and obtaining the approvals identified in Section 3.6(b) of this Agreement, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, result in the loss of a material benefit under, or give to others any right of purchase or sale, or any right of termination, amendment, acceleration, increased payments or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract to which Univision or any Univision Subsidiary is a party or by which Univision or any Univision Subsidiary or any property or asset of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, in the case of clauses (1)(ii), (2) and (3), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not prevent or delay consummation of any of the Transactions in any material respect, or otherwise prevent Univision from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Univision do not, and the consummation of the Transactions by Univision will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or self-regulatory organization, except

 (2) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or delay consummation of any of the Transactions in any material respect, or otherwise prevent Univision or Merger Sub from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  

 3.7 _ Compliance._ Univision and each Univision Subsidiary is in compliance with 

   (a) all laws, rules, regulations, orders, judgments and decrees applicable to Univision or any Univision Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary is bound or affected, and 

  

 (b) all Contracts to which Univision or any Univision Subsidiary is a party or by which Univision or any Univision Subsidiary or any property or asset of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary is bound or affected, 

  

in each case except where failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. Univision and the
Univision Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses, permits and other
authorizations and have taken all actions required by applicable law or
governmental regulations in connection with their business as now conducted,
except where the failure to obtain any such item or to take any such action
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Univision Material Adverse
Effect. Univision and the Univision\'s Subsidiaries that are FCC
licensees are financially qualified, and to the Knowledge of Univision, are
otherwise qualified to be FCC licensees. Univision is not aware of any facts
or circumstances with respect to its or any Univision Subsidiary\'s assets,
operations or FCC licenses that might prevent or delay any necessary FCC
approval of the Transactions, other than the need to obtain waivers from the
FCC of its multiple ownership rules.

  

 3.8 _ SEC Documents._ 

  

 (a) Univision has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 1999 (collectively, the "Univision Reports"). As of their respective dates, the Univision Reports, and any such reports, forms and other documents filed by Univision with the SEC after the date of this Agreement 

  

  

 (1) complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder; and 

  

 (2) did not, or will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

  

The representation in clause (2) of the preceding sentence shall not apply to
any misstatement or omission in any Univision Report filed before the date of
this Agreement which was superseded by a subsequent Univision Report filed
before the date of this Agreement. No Univision Subsidiary is required to file
any report, form or other document with the SEC.

  

 (b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into any Univision Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Univision and the Univision Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into any Univision Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows, as the case may be, of Univision and the Univision Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which would not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. Neither Univision nor any Univision Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance sheet of Univision or in the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, except for 

    

  

 (1) liabilities and obligations that were reserved on or reflected in (including the notes to), the consolidated balance sheet of Univision as of December 31, 2001; 

  

 (2) liabilities or obligations arising in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2001; and 

  

 (3) liabilities or obligations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. 

  

  

 3.9 _ Litigation._ There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or other proceedings pending against Univision or any Univision Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Univision, threatened against Univision or any Univision Subsidiary, at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state or municipal court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, that could reasonably be expected to have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. Neither Univision nor any Univision Subsidiary is subject to any settlement agreement, conciliation agreement, letter of commitment, deficiency letter, consent decree or other order of any federal, state or municipal court, commission, board, agency or instrumentality that could reasonably be expected to have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 3.10 _ Absence of Certain Changes._ Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2001, there has not been 

  

 (a) any Univision Material Adverse Effect or any circumstance or event that could reasonably be expected to have a Univision Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (b) any circumstance or event that would have been prohibited by Section 4.2(b) if the terms of such section had been in effect as of such date. 

   

 3.11 _ Taxes._ 

  

 (a) Each of Univision and the Univision Subsidiaries has filed all material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it, or requests for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed and granted and have not expired, and all tax returns and reports are complete and accurate in all material respects. Univision and each Univision Subsidiary has paid (or Univision has paid on its behalf) all taxes shown as due on such tax returns and reports. The most recent financial statements contained in the Univision Reports reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by Univision and the Univision Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements and no liabilities for taxes have been incurred by Univision or any Univision Subsidiary subsequent to such date other than in the ordinary course of its business. No deficiencies for any material amount of taxes have been proposed asserted or assessed against Univision or any Univision Subsidiary. No requests for waivers of the time to assess any taxes against Univision or any Univision Subsidiary have been granted or are pending, except for requests with respect to such taxes that have been adequately reserved for in the most recent financial statements contained in the Univision Reports. 

   

 (b) Neither Univision nor any Univision Subsidiary has taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 (c) Neither Univision nor any Univision Subsidiary is liable for the Taxes of any person (other than another current member of the Univision consolidated group), including, without limitation, as a result of the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6, any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law, or as a result of any contractual arrangement with any third party or with any taxing authority. 

   3.12 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ 

  

 (a) Section 3.12 of the Univision Disclosure Letter provides a complete and accurate description of each of the following that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Univision or any Univision Subsidiary for the benefit of its employees, or has been so sponsored, maintained or contributed to within six years prior to the Effective Time for the benefit of such individuals: each "employee benefit plan," as such term is defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, (including, but not limited to, employee benefit plans, such as foreign plans, which are not subject to the provisions of ERISA), and each personnel policy, stock option plan, stock purchase plan, stock appreciation rights plan, phantom stock plan, collective bargaining agreement, bonus plan or arrangement, incentive award plan or arrangement, vacation policy, severance pay plan, policy or agreement, deferred compensation agreement or arrangement, executive compensation or supplemental income arrangement, consulting agreement, employment agreement and each other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement, program, practice or understanding (collectively, "Univision Employee Benefit Plans"); 

  

 (b) True, correct and complete copies of each of the Univision Employee Benefit Plans have been furnished to HBC. The execution of this Agreement, and performance of the Transactions, will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any benefit plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee; 

  

 (c) Except as would not have a Univision Material Adverse Effect, all Univision Employee Benefit Plans are in compliance with all applicable requirements of law, including ERISA and the Code; 

  

 (d) Except as would not have a Univision Material Adverse Effect, neither Univision nor any Univision Subsidiary or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is or was a member of a group of which Univision is a member and which is or was under common control with Univision within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code ("Univision ERISA Affiliate") maintains or contributes to (or has maintained or contributed to in the last six years) any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, and there are no outstanding claims, or to the Knowledge of Univision, any threatened claims, with respect to any benefits under the employee benefit plans (other than routine claims for benefits); and 

  

 (e) Except as required under Section 4980B of the Code, neither Univision, nor any Univision Subsidiary or Univision ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to provide health benefits to any employee following termination of employment. 

  

 3.13 _ Labor Matters._ There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements that pertain to Univision or any Univision Subsidiary, either pending or being negotiated. Univision and the Univision Subsidiaries have not agreed to recognize any labor union or other collective bargaining representative, nor has any labor union or other collective bargaining representative been certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of any employees of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Univision, there is no union organizing effort pending or threatened against Univision or any Univision Subsidiary. There is no labor strike, labor dispute, work slowdown, stoppage or lockout actually pending, or to the Knowledge of Univision, threatened against or affecting Univision or any Univision Subsidiary, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Univision, threatened against Univision or any Univision Subsidiary relating to its business, except for any such proceeding that would not have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 3.14 _ No Brokers._ Univision has not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation of HBC or Univision to pay any finder\'s fee, brokerage or agent\'s commissions or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions except that Univision has retained UBS 

    Warburg LLC as its financial advisor, the arrangements with which have been
disclosed in writing to HBC before the date of this Agreement. Other than the
foregoing arrangements, Univision is not aware of any claim for payment of
any finder\'s fees, brokerage or agent\'s commissions or other like payments
in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions.

  

 3.15 _ Opinion of Financial Advisor._ Univision has received the opinion of UBS Warburg LLC to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair to Univision from a financial point of view, a copy of which has been provided to HBC. 

   

 3.16 _ Insurance._ Univision and its Subsidiaries maintain, with reputable insurers, insurance in such amounts, including deductible arrangements, and of such character as is usually maintained by reasonably prudent managers of companies engaged in the same or a similar business and of similar size. 

  

 3.17 _ Properties._ Univision and each Univision Subsidiary has good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances and restrictions (except liens, claims, encumbrances or restrictions arising under any existing bank agreements as described in the Univision\'s Reports and liens for taxes not yet due and payable), to all property and assets described in the Univision Reports as being owned by it, except such as would not have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. All leases to which Univision or any Univision Subsidiary is a party are valid and binding and no default has occurred or is continuing thereunder, which would result in a Univision Material Adverse Effect. Univision and the Univision Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases to which any of them is a party as lessee with such exceptions as do not materially interfere with the use made by Univision or such Subsidiary. There are no material liens on any of the assets of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Taxes when due. 

  

 3.18 _ Environmental Laws._ Neither Univision nor any Univision Subsidiary has violated any Environmental Laws, except for such violations that, singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Univision Material Adverse Effect. There are no costs or liabilities associated with any capital or operating expenditures of Univision or any Unvision Subsidiary required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws or any permit, license, consent, exemption, franchise, authorization or other approval, any related constraints on operating activities or any potential liabilities to third parties under Environmental Laws which costs, liabilities or constraints would, singly or in the aggregate, have, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Univision Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3.19 _ Takeover Statute; Section 16._ Univision and the members of the board of directors of Univision have granted such approvals and taken all actions necessary to ensure that this Agreement, the Univision Stockholder Support Agreement and the Transactions and transactions contemplated thereby are exempt from the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. The board of directors of Univision has passed the resolutions contained in Section 3.19 of the Univision Disclosure Letter with the intent to exempt the issuance of the shares of Univision Stock in connection with the Merger (including shares issuable upon exercise of options) from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 3.20 _ Airplay._ To the Knowledge of Univision, no direct or indirect payments have been made to any past or present executive or employee of Univision or any Unvision Subsidiary to influence airplay without disclosing such payment to its listeners. To the Knowledge of Univision, there has not been any governmental investigation, inquiry, disciplinary action or fine regarding any payments relating to airplay with respect to any Station directly or indirectly controlled by Univision.

Univision has filed or will timely file and prosecute with the FCC applications materially in accordance with applicable FCC rules for authority to construct and operate digital television ("DTV") Stations in each of the markets in which it now operates analog full-power television Stations, and Univision will use its best efforts to maximize where appropriate and reasonable the coverage of its DTV Stations and use its best efforts to protect the service areas of such DTV facilities from interference from other DTV Stations in accordance with FCC rules, regulations, and policies

 (1) any assets of HBC or of any HBC Subsidiary, that produce 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues or net income of HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries or that constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries; 

  

 (2) shares of HBC capital stock (provided that the restriction contained in this Section 4.1(a)(2) shall not prohibit the Representatives of HBC and the HBC Subsidiaries from providing investor relations services or other similar activities consistent with past practice); or

(any such proposal or offer being referred to in this Agreement as an
"Alternative Proposal") and that neither it nor any HBC Subsidiary will, nor
will it or any HBC Subsidiary, permit its respective Representatives to
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to an
Alternative Proposal (excluding the Merger), or otherwise facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal (excluding the
Merger); and

  

 (b) that it will notify Univision promptly if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, it; 

  

 _provided_ that nothing contained in this Section 4.1 will prohibit the board
of directors of HBC (or HBC\'s Representatives in the case of clause (2)(i)
below) from:

  

  

 (1) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the board of directors of HBC shall not withdraw or modify its recommendation as to this Agreement except in accordance with Section 4.3 hereof and provided further that neither HBC nor its board of directors shall approve or recommend an Alternative Proposal except pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.3(a) hereof; and 

  

 (2) at any time before the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of HBC (the "HBC Applicable Period") 

    

 (i) engaging in discussions or negotiations with a third party who (without any solicitation, initiation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation, directly or indirectly, by or with HBC or its Representatives after the date of this Agreement) seeks to initiate such discussions or negotiations, and furnishing such third party information concerning HBC and its business, properties and assets if, and only to the extent that, 

    

 (A) HBC\'s board of directors determines in good faith, following consultation with and after having considered the advice of a nationally recognized firm of outside legal counsel and its financial advisors that such action could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and 

  

 (B) before furnishing such information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with such person or entity, HBC (y) provides prompt, written notice to Univision to the effect that it is intending to furnish information to or enter into discussions or negotiations with such person or entity and identify such person or entity and the proposed material terms and conditions, and (z) receives from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form on terms not materially more favorable to such person or entity than the terms contained in the confidentiality agreement between HBC and Univision dated as of May 24, 2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (except that such confidentiality agreement need not require approval or request of the HBC board of directors before the making of an offer or proposal to such board of directors); and/or 

    

     

 (ii) the board of directors of HBC may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(a), at any time after the fifth business day following Univision\'s receipt of written notice from HBC that the board of directors of HBC has (x) received a Superior Proposal and (y) elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(a) (which notice must specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the person making the Superior Proposal); _provided_ that (1) the conditions set forth in clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) above have been satisfied, and (2) before or contemporaneously with such termination HBC pays the amount owed pursuant to Section 6.5(a); and provided further that after Univision\'s receipt of an initial notice of a Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 4.1(b)(2)(ii), HBC shall be obligated to notify Univision of any material change in the terms of such Superior Proposal and may terminate this Agreement thereafter in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1(b)(2)(ii), except that the five business days referred to in the second line shall be reduced to three business days for any such change. 

   

  

 (c) HBC must immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any persons or entities previously conducted by HBC or its Representatives with respect to the foregoing. 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an Alternative
Proposal, made by a third party, that the HBC board of directors, acting
consistent with its fiduciary duties, determines in good faith (after
consultation with its attorneys and financial advisor) (x) is reasonably
capable of being consummated, taking into account all relevant legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Alternative Proposal and the
source of its financing, on the terms proposed, and (y) after taking into
account the strategic benefits anticipated to be derived from the Merger and
the long-term prospects of HBC and Univision as a combined company, if
consummated, would reasonably be expected to result in a transaction more
favorable to the stockholders of HBC from a financial point of view, than the
Transactions.

  

 (d) HBC understands and agrees that any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.1 by any of its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach hereof by HBC.

 (5) must, and must cause each Univision Subsidiary to, conduct its operations according to their usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as previously conducted; provided that Univision may sell any Univision Subsidiary in its ordinary course of business for an amount not in excess of $500 million individually or $1 billion in the aggregate; 

  

 (6) must use its reasonable efforts, and must cause each Univision Subsidiary to use its reasonable efforts, to preserve intact their business organizations and goodwill, keep available the services of their respective officers and employees subject to customary practices with respect to employee termination and maintain satisfactory relationships with those persons having business relationships with them; 

  

 (7) must not, and must not permit any Univision Subsidiary to, grant, confer or award any option, warrant, conversion right or other right not existing on the date of this Agreement to acquire any shares of its capital stock at an exercise price of less than the then current market value; 

  

 (8) must not, and must not permit any Univision Subsidiary to, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with A. Jerrold Perenchio ("Perenchio"), except in accordance with Univision\'s bylaws; 

  

 (9) must not, and must not permit any Univision Subsidiary to, make any change to its accounting (including tax accounting) methods, principles or practices, except as may be required by United States generally accepted accounting principles and except, in the case of tax accounting methods, principles or practices, in the ordinary course of business of Univision or any Univision Subsidiary consistent with past practice, or any change in its tax elections that would materially increase its tax liabilities; 

  

 (10) must not amend any agreements between Univision (or any Univision Subsidiary) and Grupo Televisa, S.A. (or any \'33 Act Affiliate of Grupo Televisa, S.A.) or Corporacion Venezolana de Television, C.A. (or any \'33 Act Affiliate of Corporacion Venezolana de Television, C.A.), in a manner that has a Univision Material Adverse Effect (and Univision will promptly notify HBC of any such amendment); and 

  

 (11) must not authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions. 

  

  

 4.3 _ Meetings of Stockholders._ Each of Univision and HBC will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and its Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote upon 

   

 (a) in the case of Univision, an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to (x) authorize the appropriate number of shares of Univision Class B Common Stock as described in Exhibit F necessary to satisfy its obligations under Section 1.8 and (y) if desired by Univision, to increase the number of shares of authorized Univision Class A Common Stock, Class P Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Univision, Class T Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Univision and Class V Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Univision, or any of them; the approval of the issuance of the Univision Stock as contemplated by this Agreement; and an amendment to increase the shares covered by Univision\'s 1996 Performance Award Plan, and 

  

 (b) in the case of HBC, the adoption of this Agreement. 

  

Such meetings will be scheduled, based upon the parties\' best estimates, to
occur promptly after the date on which all regulatory approvals are expected
to have been received, provided that if by such date all regulatory approvals
are not received, either party may postpone its meeting to a date on which

     

 such party reasonably believes all such approvals shall have been received.
The board of directors of each of Univision and HBC will recommend such
approval or adoption, as the case may be, and Univision and HBC will each
take all lawful action to solicit such approval or adoption, as the case may
be, including, without limitation, timely mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 4.8). Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, the board of directors of HBC may withdraw or modify its
recommendation that stockholders adopt this Agreement and its finding that
such adoption is advisable if the board of directors of HBC, after
consultation with a nationally recognized firm of outside counsel, determines
in good faith that doing so is consistent with its fiduciary duties to HBC
and its stockholders under applicable law. Subject to its rights to terminate
this Agreement under Section 6.3(a), the HBC board of directors shall convene,
at the time described above, a meeting of the HBC stockholders to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, which obligation shall not be
affected by a modification or withdrawal of its recommendation regarding the
adoption of this Agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence.

  

 4.4 _ Filings, Other Action._ 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, HBC and Univision will: 

  

  

 (1) use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in 

    

 (i) determining which filings are required to be made before the Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained before the Effective Time from, governmental or regulatory authorities of the United States, the several states and foreign jurisdictions in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions; and 

  

 (ii) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits or authorizations; and 

    

 (2) use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other action and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or appropriate to consummate and make effective the Transactions; _provided_ that neither party will be required to make any payment to any non-governmental third party. 

  

  

 (b) Univision shall use its reasonable best efforts and take all reasonable actions as are necessary to the extent required by the FCC or any Governmental Entities with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust laws (each, a "Government Antitrust Entity") to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, it being understood, however, that in no event shall Univision be required to: 

  

  

 (1) divest any interest in any broadcast television network, television station, or cable television network; or 

  

 (2) take any action that could reasonably be expected to have a Univision Material Adverse Effect or an HBC Material Adverse Effect; provided that no actions required by any Government Antitrust Entity as a condition to receipt of the FCC Approval (as defined below) or the Antitrust Approval (as defined below) with respect to any radio assets, beneficial ownership of which would be attributed to Univision as a result of the Transactions, shall be deemed to be capable of constituting or resulting in a Univision Material Adverse Effect or an HBC Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this clause, "FCC Approval" means an initial written action or order from the FCC, or the staff of the FCC acting on delegated authority, granting its consent to the transfer or assignment of the HBC FCC Licenses contemplated by this Agreement, and "Antitrust Approval" means termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or entry into a consent decree or letter agreement with the applicable Government Antitrust Entity evidencing the resolution of any of such entity\'s objections or concerns regarding the Transactions. 

  

    
 

  

If Univision takes any such action, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Univision to take such action before the Closing Date.

  

 (c) Each of Univision and HBC shall: 

  

  

 (1) provide promptly to the FCC or to any Government Antitrust Entity such information and documents requested by the FCC or such Government Antitrust Entity necessary to obtain its consent to the consummation of the Transactions; 

  

 (2) file any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to certify as soon as practicable its substantial compliance with any requests for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act; 

  

 (3) use reasonable best efforts to oppose and defend against any litigation or to oppose and vacate any injunction or restraining or other order that prevents or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions; 

   

 (4) keep the other apprised of any material communication between such party and the FCC or any Government Antitrust Authority pertaining to the Transactions and promptly provide the other with copies of any such communication that is in writing; and 

  

 (5) otherwise use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions promptly. 

  

  

 (d) The parties acknowledge that, subject to the foregoing, Univision shall control the process of dealing with the FCC and any Government Antitrust Entity regarding any divestiture of assets or interests or regarding opposing any litigation or order described in clause (c)(3) of this Section. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no failure to obtain termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or consent of the FCC shall be deemed to be a breach hereunder by HBC or by Univision, subject to the applicable party\'s obligations under this Section 4.4. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, failure of a party to satisfy its obligations under this Section 4.4 shall be a material breach hereunder. 

  

 4.5 _ Third-Party Consents._ Each party must, and must cause its subsidiaries to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents required in connection with the Transactions, provided that neither party shall be required to make any payment to any non-governmental third party, and each party must promptly notify the other parties of any failure or prospective failure to obtain any such consents and, if requested by the other party, must provide such other party with copies of all material filings and correspondence in connection with, and evidence of, all consents applied for or obtained. 

  

 4.6 _ Inspection of Records._ Subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each of HBC and Univision will, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the FCC, 

  

 (a) allow all Representatives of the other reasonable access at all reasonable times to the offices, records and files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs, of HBC and Univision and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, 

  

 (b) furnish to the other, the other\'s counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such persons may reasonably request, and 

  

 (c) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors and auditors of HBC or Univision, as the case may be, to cooperate with the other in the other\'s investigation of the business of it and its Subsidiaries, including the delivery of audit working papers. 

     

 4.7 _ Publicity._ The initial press release relating to this Agreement will be a joint press release and thereafter HBC and Univision shall, subject to their respective legal obligations (including requirements of stock exchanges and other similar regulatory bodies), consult with each other, and use reasonable efforts to agree upon the text of any press release, before issuing any such press release or otherwise making public statements with respect to the Transactions and in making any filings with any federal or state governmental or regulatory agency or with any national securities exchange with respect thereto. 

  

 4.8 _ Registration Statement._ 

   

 (a) Univision and HBC will cooperate, prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy statement with respect to the meetings of the stockholders of HBC and of Univision in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Univision will also file a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "Form S-4") under the Securities Act, with respect to the Univision Stock issuable in connection with the Merger. Univision will use all reasonable efforts, and HBC will cooperate with Univision, to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable following its filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Univision will, as promptly as practicable, provide copies of any written comments received from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 to HBC and advise HBC of any verbal comments with respect to the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Univision will use its best efforts to obtain, before the Effective Time of the Form S-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the Transactions and will pay all expenses incident thereto. 

  

 (b) Univision agrees that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the respective meetings of stockholders of HBC and Univision, or, in the case of the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that any such untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact was made by Univision in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning HBC furnished to Univision by HBC specifically for use in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. HBC agrees that the written information concerning HBC provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the respective meetings of stockholders of HBC and Univision, or, the case of written information concerning HBC provided by HBC for inclusion in the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (c) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including preliminary materials filed with the SEC, will be made by Univision or HBC without the reasonable approval of the other party. Univision will advise HBC, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Univision Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. 

  

 4.9 _ Listing Application._ Univision will prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the shares of Univision Class A Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger (including, if necessary, the Univision Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Class B Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Forward Merger) and the shares of Univision Class A Common Stock issuable in connection with options to acquire HBC Class A Common Stock, and will 

     

 use reasonable efforts to obtain, before the Effective Time, approval for
the listing of such Univision Class A Common Stock, subject to official notice
of issuance.

  

 4.10 _ Further Action._ Each party hereto will, subject to the fulfillment at or before the Effective Time of each of the conditions of performance set forth in this Agreement or the waiver thereof, perform such further acts and execute such documents as may be reasonably required to effect the Merger not inconsistent with this Agreement. 

  

 4.11 _ Affiliate Letters._ At least 30 days before the Closing Date, HBC will deliver to Univision a list of names and addresses of those persons who were, in HBC\'s reasonable judgment, at the record date for its stockholders\' meeting to adopt this Agreement, Affiliates of HBC. HBC must use all reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Univision, before the Closing Date, from each of the Affiliates of HBC identified in the foregoing list, an Affiliate Letter in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. Univision will be entitled to place legends as specified in such Affiliate Letters on the certificates evidencing any Univision Stock to be received by such Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Univision Stock, consistent with the terms of such Affiliate Letters. 

  

 4.12 _ Expenses._ Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such expenses except as expressly provided in this Agreement and except that (a) the filing fees in connection with the HSR Act filing, (b) the filing fee in connection with the filing of the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC, (c) the filing fees in connection with necessary applications to the FCC in connection with the Merger and (d) the expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, will be shared equally by HBC and Univision. 

  

 4.13 _ Insurance; Indemnity._ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Univision will indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent that HBC would have been permitted under applicable law each person who is now, or has been at any time before the date of this Agreement, an officer or director of HBC (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such occurring at or before the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an "Action"), 

  

  

 (1) any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification must promptly notify Univision thereof; 

   

 (2) Univision must pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Univision, in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to the full extent permitted by applicable law, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law; 

  

 (3) Univision will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ that Univision will not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent and _provided, further_ , that Univision shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action except to the extent that in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably satisfactory to Univision, two or more of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action; 

  

 (4) Univision will obtain the prior written approval of the Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of any 

  

    
  

 third-party action or any liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as
a result of such settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment,
injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified
Party or if, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment could have a material
adverse effect on its business, operations, assets or financial condition;

  

 (5) Univision will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such third-party action; and 

   

 (6) Univision will not be entitled to control (but will be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the Indemnified Party will be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third-party action (1) as to which Univision fails to assume the defense within a reasonable length of time or (2) to the extent the third-party action seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of Univision without the prior written consent of Univision. No Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnity hereunder if it consents to the entry of any judgment or enters into any settlement with respect to a third party action over which it has sole control that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to Univision of a release from all liability in respect of such third-party action. 

  

  

 (b) Univision must cause the Surviving Corporation of the Merger to keep in effect for five years following the Effective Time provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws providing for exculpation of director liability and indemnification of the Indemnified Parties as are currently set forth in the HBC Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended except as required by applicable law or except to make changes permitted by law that would enlarge the Indemnified Parties\' right of indemnification. 

  

 (c) For five years after the Effective Time, Univision must cause to be maintained officers\' and directors\' liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are currently covered, in their capacities as officers and directors, by HBC\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance; _provided_ that Univision will not be required to maintain or procure such coverage to pay an annual premium in excess of one and one-half times the current annual premium paid by HBC for its existing coverage (the "Cap"); and _provided, further_ , that if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the Cap, Univision will only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap. HBC represents and warrants that the current annual premium paid by HBC for its existing coverage is $450,000. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section will survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) At Closing, Univision will execute indemnification agreements in the form attached to Univision\'s Reports with any HBC directors and officers who become directors or executive officers of Univision or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 4.14 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ The consummation of the Merger will not be treated as a termination of employment for purposes of any HBC Employee Benefit Plan; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement will prohibit Univision and its Subsidiaries from amending, terminating or otherwise modifying any HBC Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law. To the 

     

 extent such periods of service would have counted under similar HBC Employee
Benefit Plans, Univision and any Affiliates of Univision shall cause periods
of service with HBC and its Subsidiaries to count for purposes of eligibility
and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit
plans) under Univision Employee Benefit Plans that, at any time after the
Effective Time, provide benefits to employees of HBC or its Subsidiaries. If
any employee of HBC or its Subsidiaries participates in a Univision group
health plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs,
credit will be given under such Univision group health plan during such year
for any deductibles or out-of-pocket amounts previously paid in such year by
such employee and taken into account under the HBC group health plan. All
employees and their dependents who are presently participating in HBC Employee
Benefit Plans will be entitled to immediately participate in Univision
Employee Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section 4.14, Univision shall have the option of keeping
one or more of the HBC Employee Benefit Plans in effect for the remainder of
the plan year, rather than bringing the HBC employees under the corresponding
Univision Employee Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time. In such event,
all employees and their dependents who are participating in an HBC Employee
Benefit Plan through the remainder of the plan year will be entitled to
immediately participate in the corresponding Univision Employee Benefit Plan
as of the date following their termination of participation. Any group health
plan maintained by Univision in which former employees of HBC or its
Subsidiaries participate in accordance with this paragraph will not limit
coverage based on pre-existing conditions or waiting periods to the extent
such pre-existing conditions were not taken into account or the waiting
periods were satisfied under the corresponding HBC group health plan.

   

 4.15 _ Stock Option Plans._ 

  

 (a) HBC and Univision will take all such actions as may be necessary so that, at the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the HBC Long Term Incentive Plan, each option to purchase shares of HBC Class A Common Stock pursuant to HBC\'s Long-Term Incentive Plan ("HBC Stock Option") which is outstanding as of the Effective Time will be assumed by Univision and converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of Univision Class A Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of HBC Class A Common Stock subject to such option multiplied by .85, at an exercise price per share of Univision Class A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest penny) equal to the former exercise price per share of HBC Class A Common Stock under such option immediately before the Effective Time divided by .85; _provided_ that in the case of any HBC Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula will be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) In addition, Univision may elect to offer each holder of an HBC Stock Option the right, but not the obligation, to surrender such options for a substitute Univision Stock Option issued under the terms of the Univision Stock Plan. The substituted Univision Stock Option will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the converted HBC Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ that the vesting schedule in respect of any Univision Stock Option issued in substitution for any unvested or partially unvested HBC Stock Option will provide that such Univision Stock Option shall vest in four equal annual increments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant of such HBC Stock Option. To the extent necessary, Univision will prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the shares of Univision Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to such substituted Univision Stock Options, and will use reasonable efforts to promptly obtain approval for the listing of such Univision Class A Common Stock, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Univision will deliver to the holders of HBC Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights with respect thereto. Univision will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Univision Class A Common Stock for issuance upon exercise 

     

 of converted and substituted HBC Stock Options following the Merger.
Univision will file (or cause to be filed) at the Effective Time and will use
its best efforts to have declared effective a registration statement on Form
S-8 under the Securities Act within 10 business days after the Merger
registering the shares underlying the substituted Univision Stock Options or
any assumed HBC Stock Options. Univision agrees that after the Closing, HBC
employees will be eligible to receive Univision Stock Options that, if and
when granted, will take into account the recipient\'s time of service and
position at HBC.

   4.16 _ Cooperation, Notification._ Each party must 

  

 (a) confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other party to discuss, subject to applicable law, material operational matters and the general status of its ongoing operations, 

  

 (b) promptly notify the other party of any significant changes in its business, properties, assets, condition (financial or other), results of operations or prospects, 

  

 (c) promptly advise the other party of any material inaccuracy in any of its representations or warranties or nonperformance of any of its covenants in this Agreement or of any change or event which has had or, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, is reasonably likely to result in, in the case of HBC, an HBC Material Adverse Effect or, in the case of Univision, a Univision Material Adverse Effect and 

  

 (d) promptly provide the other party with copies of all filings made by such party or any of its subsidiaries with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. 

  

 4.17 _ Post-Merger Board of Directors._ Univision\'s board of directors will take such action as may be necessary to elect as directors of Univision, McHenry T. Tichenor, Jr. ("Tichenor") and another individual designated by HBC and reasonably acceptable to Univision\'s board of directors; _provided_ that if, before the Effective Time, either designee declines or is unable to serve, the majority of the remaining members of HBC\'s board of directors, subject to Univision\'s approval not to be unreasonably withheld, will designate another person to serve in such person\'s stead. 

  

 4.18 _ Post-Merger Management._ Immediately after the Effective Time, Univision will establish a four-member senior executive team dedicated to the integration and synergy of Univision and HBC. Unless otherwise agreed by Perenchio and Tichenor, the team will be comprised of Tichenor, Jeffrey T. Hinson, Andrew Hobson, and Ray Rodriguez. The team will be chaired by Tichenor. 

   

 4.19 _ Ancillary Actions and Agreements._ On or before the Closing Date, 

  

 (a) Univision will file with the Delaware Secretary of State an amended Certificate of Incorporation containing the terms set forth on _Exhibit F_, as well as increases in authorized shares, if desired by Univision, as discussed in Section 4.3(a); and 

  

 (b) Univision will execute a Registration Rights Agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit G._

   

 4.20 _ Non-Interference._ Neither party will enter into any acquisition, merger, business combination or other similar agreement or take any other action that would have the effect of preventing or significantly impeding, delaying or interfering with the Merger. 

  

 4.21 _ No Additional Representations and Warranties._ Each of Univision and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and HBC, on the other hand, agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by the other party that are expressly set forth in Article II and Article III of this Agreement, as applicable, neither party has made and shall not be deemed to have made to such other party any representation or warranty of any kind. Unless otherwise expressly liable pursuant to a written agreement, no Representative or "affiliate" (each such person a \'33 Act Affiliate") within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act, acting in his or its capacity as an agent of a party, shall have any liability or obligation for breaches of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each party hereby waives and releases all claims of any such liability and obligation, except as set forth below. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party agrees that neither the 

     

 other party nor any of its \'33 Act Affiliates or Representatives makes or
has made any representation or warranty to such party or to any of its
Representatives or \'33 Act Affiliates with respect to:

  

 (a) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) of future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries; and 

  

 (b) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to such party or its Representatives or \'33 Act Affiliates with respect to the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made by the other party and contained in Article II or Article III of this Agreement, as applicable. 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.21, nothing in
this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement, any Representative,
or any \'33 Act Affiliate from any liability for statutory or common law
fraud.

  

 4.22 _ SAR\'s._ HBC has granted certain stock options to certain individuals (the "Optionholders") which provide for a grant of stock appreciation rights upon a change in control of HBC. HBC shall use its reasonable best efforts to have each Optionholder waive its right to the stock appreciation right prior to consummation of the Transactions. In exchange for each Optionholder\'s waiver, Univision shall agree to pay, on behalf of each such Optionholder, any brokerage commission, up to a maximum of $.05 per share, incurred in connection with the sale of any shares of capital stock underlying the stock options made contemporaneously with such exercise. 

   

 4.23 _ Conversion to Class B Common Stock._ If the Forward Merger has not been effected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the FCC has deemed Clear Channel Communications, Inc. ("Clear Channel") to have an attributable interest in Univision under the Federal Communications Act or any of its rules or regulations at any time after the Effective Time, upon the request of Clear Channel and the submission of a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Univision Class A Common Stock then owned by Clear Channel, Univision will promptly issue to Clear Channel in exchange therefore, a certificate or certificates representing an equivalent number of shares of Univision Class B Common Stock. In such event, Univision shall prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the Univision Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Univision Class B Common Stock.

ARTICLE VI

  

TERMINATION

  

 6.1 _ Termination by Mutual Consent._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Merger Sub or HBC or the approval of the stockholders of Univision contemplated hereby, by the mutual consent of Univision and HBC. 

  

 6.2 _ Termination by Either Univision or HBC._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned by action of the board of directors of either Univision or HBC, before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Merger Sub or HBC or the approval of the stockholders of Univision contemplated hereby, if 

  

 (a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by September 30, 2003; _provided_ , in the case of a termination pursuant to this clause (a), that the terminating party shall not have breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the failure to consummate the Merger by September 30, 2003; 

  

 (b) the approval of HBC\'s stockholders required by Section 5.1(a) shall not have been obtained at a meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment thereof; 

   

 (c) the approval of Univision\'s stockholders required by Section 5.1(a) shall not have been obtained at a meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment thereof; 

  

 (d) a United States federal or state court of competent jurisdiction or United States federal or state governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (d) shall have used all reasonable efforts to remove such injunction, order or decree; or 

  

 (e) the FCC shall have issued an order or ruling or taken other action denying approval of the Transactions, and such order, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable. 

  

 6.3 _ Termination by HBC._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Merger Sub or HBC or the approval of the stockholders of Univision contemplated hereby, by action of the board of directors of HBC 

  

 (a) during the HBC Applicable Period, as contemplated by Section 4.1(b)(2)(ii); 

  

 (b) if there has been a breach by Univision of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which would have or would be reasonably likely to have a Univision Material Adverse Effect; 

     

 (c) if there has been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of Univision, which breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given by HBC to Univision, and which would cause the condition set forth in Section 5.2(b) not to be able to be satisfied; or 

  

 (d) if the board of directors of Univision shall have failed to recommend against a tender or exchange offer for the acquisition of 50 percent or more of Univision\'s outstanding capital stock within the time periods prescribed under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or Univision shall have (i) entered into or recommended or been required to disclose a transaction, or proposal or offer, involving the acquisition, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, of 50% or more of the shares of Univision\'s capital stock then outstanding, voting securities representing 50% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Univision capital stock, or all or substantially all of the assets of Univision (a "Univision Acquisition Proposal"), other than an unsolicited Univision Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of Univision is recommending against or with respect to which the board of directors of Univision has not yet taken a position (within the time period provided for in Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2, if applicable) or (ii) entered into any agreement in respect of a Univision Acquisition Proposal. 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, HBC\'s ability to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.3(a) is conditioned upon the prior payment by HBC of any
amounts owed by it pursuant to Section 6.5(a)(1).

  

 6.4 _ Termination by Univision._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of HBC or Merger Sub or the approval of the stockholders of Univision contemplated hereby, by action of the board of directors of Univision, if 

  

 (a) the board of directors of HBC shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner materially adverse to Univision its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or shall have recommended, or failed to recommend against, an Alternative Proposal to HBC stockholders within the time periods prescribed under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act; provided that Univision may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) after the HBC stockholder meeting required to be held pursuant to Section 4.3; 

  

 (b) there has been a breach by HBC of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which would have or would be reasonably likely to have an HBC Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (c) there has been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of HBC, which breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given by Univision to HBC, and which would cause the condition set forth in Section 5.3(b) not to be able to be satisfied. 

   

 6.5 _ Effect of Termination and Abandonment._ 

  

 (a) If any person shall have made an Alternative Proposal for HBC and thereafter 

  

  

 (1) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.4(a) or 

  

  

 (2) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.2(b) after a public announcement of an Alternative Proposal before a meeting of HBC\'s stockholders and a definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal is executed, or approved by the board of directors of HBC, or an Alternative Proposal is consummated in each case, within one year after such termination, 

  

then HBC shall pay Univision a fee of $100 million which shall include all
fees and expenses of Univision, and Univision shall have no further right to
recoup any other amounts, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of
same day funds either on the date contemplated in the last sentence of

     

 Section 6.3 if applicable or, otherwise, within two business days after such
amount becomes due. HBC acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 6.5(a) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, Univision would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if HBC fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 6.5(a),
and, in order to obtain such payment, Univision commences a suit which results
in a judgment against HBC for the fee set forth in this Section 6.5(a), HBC
must pay to Univision its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the rate of 12% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is
less.

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated and the Merger is abandoned pursuant to this ARTICLE VI, all obligations of the parties will terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 6.5 and Section 4.12 and except for the provisions of ARTICLE VII. Moreover, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.3 or 6.4, nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice the ability of the non-breaching party from seeking damages from any other party for any willful breach of this Agreement, including without limitation, attorneys\' fees and the right to pursue any remedy at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Univision nor HBC shall have any liability whatsoever solely as a result of any inability to deliver the certificate contemplated by Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.3(a), respectively, as to the truth and correctness of the representations and warranties of such party contained in this Agreement at the Effective Time. Termination of this Agreement will not terminate the obligations of any party under the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (c) In the event of a termination by HBC under 6.3(d), Univision shall pay to HBC a termination fee of $100 million within two business days after such termination. 

   

 6.6 _ Extension, Waiver._ At any time before the Effective Time, any party hereto, by action taken by its board of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, 

  

 (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, 

  

 (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or 

   

 (c) subject to applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 7.4 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Exhibits, HBC Disclosure Letter, Univision Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and any documents delivered by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties with respect thereto.

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 7.6 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. 

  

 7.7 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement.

 7.10 _ Waivers._ Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, will be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. 

  

 7.11 _ Incorporation of Exhibits._ HBC Disclosure Letter, Univision Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits attached hereto and referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated in this Agreement and made a part of this Agreement for all purposes as if fully set forth in this Agreement.

If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
