<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement"), dated as of June&nbsp;11, 2002, is by and among Univision Communications&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware

Univision ("Merger Sub"). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HBC
and Univision have determined to engage in a business combination whereby Merger Sub will be merged with and into HBC, with HBC continuing as the surviving
corporation of such merger and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Univision. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
respective boards of directors of HBC, Univision and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger (as defined below). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
induce Univision to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of HBC have executed a stockholder support agreement ("HBC Stockholder Support Agreement") with
Univision in the form of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
induce HBC to enter into this Agreement, the principal stockholder of Univision has executed a stockholder support agreement ("Univision Stockholder Support
Agreement") with HBC in the form of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368 of the Code. </FONT></P>

the foregoing, in the event that the Forward Merger is necessitated pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.12, at the Effective Time, HBC will be merged with and into Merger Sub, in accordance with the DGCL and
with the effect provided therein. In such case, Merger Sub will be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of Univision and the separate
corporate existence of HBC will cease. </FONT></P>

and HBC will cooperate, prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy statement with respect to the meetings of the stockholders of HBC and of Univision in
connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Univision will also file&nbsp;a Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-4 (the "Form&nbsp;S-4") under the
Securities Act, with respect to the Univision Stock issuable in connection with the Merger. Univision will use all reasonable efforts, and HBC will cooperate with Univision, to have the
Form&nbsp;S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable following its filing and to keep the Form&nbsp;S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the Merger. Univision will, as promptly as practicable, provide copies of any written comments received from the SEC with respect to the Form&nbsp;S-4 to HBC and advise HBC of any verbal
comments with respect to the Form&nbsp;S-4 received from the SEC. Univision will use its best efforts to obtain, before the Effective Time of the Form&nbsp;S-4, all
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the Transactions and will pay all expenses incident thereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Univision
agrees that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the respective meetings

made, not misleading; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that any such untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a

agrees that the written information concerning HBC provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the
time of the respective meetings of stockholders of HBC and Univision, or, the case of written information concerning HBC provided by HBC for inclusion in the Form&nbsp;S-4 or any
amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;No

has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Univision Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request

by Univision and converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of Univision Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of HBC
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock subject to such option multiplied by .85, at an exercise price per share of Univision Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest penny) equal to the former

exercise provisions) as were applicable to the converted HBC Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that the vesting schedule in
respect of any Univision Stock Option issued in substitution for any unvested or partially unvested HBC Stock Option will provide that such Univision Stock Option shall vest in four equal annual
