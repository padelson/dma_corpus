forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the Per Share Closing Payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if,
upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate is properly endorsed

payment pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of

contemplated by this Section 3.02(c), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to

Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.

promptly as

  



        
   

  



  

practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than December
31 of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.  Parent may
elect to use this procedure for all or a portion of the Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and Company
RSUs.

  



  

(iii)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain all consents and
take all actions necessary to give effect to the provisions of Section
3.03(a), Section 3.03(b) and Section 3.03(c).

  



  

(e) _No Further Rights_.  From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Appraisal Shares) and holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares, Company Performance RSUs and Company RSUs, respectively, shall cease
to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares, Company Performance RSUs or Company RSUs, respectively, except the
right to receive the portion of the Per Share Closing Payment and the Per
Share Escrow Payments to which such holder is entitled or as provided by
Applicable Law.

  



  

(f) _Unclaimed Consideration_.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund or the
Escrow Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance
RSUs and Company RSUs one year after the Effective Time or, in the case of
the Escrow Fund, one year after the Final PHC Liability Release Date, shall,
upon demand, be delivered to Parent, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company
Performance RSUs and Company RSUs who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their portion of the Per Share Closing Payment and the
Per Share Escrow Payments, without any interest thereon. Any Per Share
Closing Payment and any portion of the Escrow Fund unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares, Company Performance RSUs and Company RSUs as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

SECTION 3.04. _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted or withheld) from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and
Company RSUs such amounts as Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is required under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment; _provided_ that Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
must pay over such amounts to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance
with Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld and
paid over by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock

  



        
   

  



  

Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and Company
RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  



  

SECTION 3.05. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate, or any agreement
evidencing any Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company
Performance RSUs and Company RSUs, shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming the Certificate or agreement evidencing Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and Company RSUs to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the delivery of an agreement of indemnification or
bond reasonably satisfactory to Parent, against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate or agreement evidencing Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and
Company RSUs, the Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate or agreement, the Per Share Closing Payment
and direct the Escrow Agent to release any applicable Per Share Escrow
Payments to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, or such agreement evidencing such Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and
Company RSUs as contemplated by this Article III.

  



  

SECTION 3.06. _Appraisal Rights_. (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, shares
of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any holder who shall not have consented
in writing or voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to, and shall
have demanded properly in writing, appraisal for such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ", and each holder of Appraisal Shares, an " _Appraisal
Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Per Share Closing Payment or any Escrow Payments. Such
Appraisal Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Appraisal Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of such Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Appraisal Shares held
by Appraisal Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Appraisal Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Per Share Closing Payment and the Per Share
Escrow Payments in the manner provided in this Article III, without interest.

  



  

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with (i) prompt notice after receipt by
the Company of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate at its own expense in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payments with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

  



  

SECTION 3.07. _Tax Matters_. (a) As of the date hereof, the Company intends
to request one or more rulings from, or to pursue one or more closing
agreements with, the IRS to

  



         
 

  



  

reach a determination as to some or all of the issues relating to the amount
of the PHC Liability (the " _PHC Rulings_ "), which ruling or
closing agreement requests shall be prepared by the Company and the Company
Advisor at the direction of the Stockholder Representative. In connection
with PHC Rulings and the procedures set out in this Section 3.07, the
Stockholder Representative shall (i) provide Parent and the Parent Advisor at
least five Business Days (or such longer period as is reasonably requested by
Parent in light of the circumstances relating to the due date and the
complexity of the submissions) to review all submissions to the IRS relating
to the PHC Rulings prior to making such submissions and to ask the Company,
the Company Advisor and the Stockholder Representative questions about the
submissions to the IRS relating to the PHC Rulings or other matters covered
by this Section 3.07, (ii) provide to Parent and the Parent Advisor, no later
than three Business Days after receipt, copies of all written correspondence
received from the IRS in relation to the PHC Rulings or the matters governed
by this Section 3.07 and (iii) provide to Parent and the Parent Advisor, as
soon as practicable after the date hereof, copies of all written
correspondence received on or prior to the date hereof from the IRS in
relation to the PHC Rulings or the matters governed by this Section 3.07.

  



  

As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall provide to
the Stockholder Representative and Parent copies of Tax Returns of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries filed for the taxable year ending
January 2, 2010. For any such Tax Returns that have not been filed prior to
the date hereof, the Company will prepare and file such Tax Returns, as
applicable, taking tax positions therein for which the Company has a
reasonable basis (in accordance with the Code and the United States Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder). The Company shall promptly notify the
Stockholder Representative and Parent if any such Tax Returns will require
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pay any Taxes as a result
of the status of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
"personal holding company" under Section 542 of the Code or the application
of Section 541 of the Code. Without the consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the
Company shall not file any such Tax Returns showing any liability for Taxes
as a result of the status of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
as a "personal holding company" under Section 542 of the Code or the
application of Section 541 of the Code.

  



  

Prior to the Final PHC Liability Release Date, within five Business Days of
the receipt of notice of any IRS audit with respect to any taxable year that
(i) ended after January 3, 2004 and (ii) ends on or prior to the Closing
Date or includes the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver a complete and
correct copy of such notice and any related documentation to the Stockholder
Representative and Parent to the extent related to PHC Liability. The
Stockholder Representative and its representatives shall direct the Companys
discussions with and submissions to the IRS relating to the PHC Liability in
connection with such audit; _provided_ that (i) for the avoidance of doubt,
the rights of the Stockholder Representative and its representatives shall
only apply to the portions of any such audit that relate to the PHC Liability
and (ii) to the extent it is reasonably expected that, as a result of such
audit, the Company could be liable for a material amount of PHC Liability
that would not be recoverable from the Escrow Fund (taking into account
amounts expected to be released from the Escrow Fund prior to the resolution
of such audit), Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly
direct the Companys discussions with and submissions to the IRS relating to
the PHC Liability in connection with such audit and neither Parent nor the
Stockholder Representative shall enter into any settlement with respect to
such audit without the others consent.

  



        
   

  



  

The Company may not agree to any extension of statutes of limitations with
respect to the Companys Tax Returns for any taxable year that (i) ended
after January 3, 2004 and (ii) ends on or prior to the Closing Date or
includes the Closing Date, without the consent of the Stockholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ that such consent shall not be required (i) in the
case of an extension resulting from the Company filing an amended Tax Return
with respect to items that do not relate to PHC Liability that it reasonably
believes is required by the Code or the United States Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, (ii) if the IRS requests the extension or (iii) if
the Company reasonably determines that not agreeing to such extension would
have a material adverse impact (other than with respect to PHC Liability) on
the Company.  The Company shall, at the direction of the Stockholder
Representative, agree to any extension of statutes of limitations with
respect to the Companys Tax Returns for any taxable year that (x) ended
after January 3, 2004 and (y) ends on or prior to the Closing Date or includes
the Closing Date, to the extent such extension would not have a material
adverse impact on the Company.

  



  

(b) Parent shall be entitled to make comments on proposed submissions to the
IRS, and the Stockholder Representative shall reasonably consider such
comments, but all decisions by the Stockholder Representative to accept or
reject such comments shall be final.  The Stockholder Representative shall
control all conferences and teleconferences with the IRS in connection with
the PHC Rulings. Parent shall be entitled to observe, through the Parent
Advisor or another advisor selected by Parent (but in no event more than two
representatives), any conference or, to the extent practicable,
teleconference the Company or its representatives and the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives have with the IRS in connection with
the PHC Liability; _provided_  that such advisor shall have no right of, and
agrees to refrain from, any participation in such conference other than
observation thereof. The Company shall provide Parent and the Parent Advisor
and the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholder Representatives
Advisor with notice of any scheduled conference or teleconference within a
reasonable amount of time in advance thereof. The Company shall execute an IRS
Form 8821 (Tax Information Authorization) to permit Parent Advisor to observe
any such conference or teleconference to the extent provided by this Section
3.07. The Company shall execute an IRS Form 2848 (Power of Attorney and
Declaration of Representative) and any other documents required to permit the
Company Advisor, the Stockholder Representatives Advisor and the Stockholder
Representative to represent the Company before the IRS with respect to the
PHC Rulings and other matters provided by this Section 3.07, subject to the
terms of this Section 3.07. Parent and, after the Closing, the Company shall
not take any actions that would prejudice the rights of the Stockholder
Representatives Advisor and Stockholder Representative under this Section
3.07 or interfere with the Stockholder Representatives ability to obtain PHC
Rulings in a timely manner.

  



  

Following the Closing, Parent agrees to, and to cause the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the Stockholder Representative and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives and the Company Advisor
access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to the
properties, books, contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, work of the
Company Advisor and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
to those employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to whom the
Stockholder Representative or the Company Advisor requests access, and,
during such period shall make available to the Stockholder Representative and
the Company Advisor any information

  



        
   

  



  

concerning the Company or a Company Subsidiary as the Stockholder
Representative or Company Advisor, as the case may be, may reasonably request
in connection with or related to the PHC Rulings.

  



  

(c) Within three Business Days of the receipt of any proposed PHC Ruling
from the IRS, the Company shall deliver a complete and correct copy of such
proposed PHC Ruling to each of the Stockholder Representative and Parent.
 Parent shall be entitled to at least five Business Days (or such longer
period as is reasonably requested by Parent in light of the circumstances
relating to the due date and the complexity of the submissions) to make
comments on such proposed PHC Ruling before the IRS finalizes such proposed
PHC Ruling, and the Stockholder Representative shall reasonably consider such
comments. Within three Business Days of the receipt of any PHC Ruling from
the IRS, the Company shall deliver a complete and correct copy of such PHC
Ruling to the Stockholder Representative and Parent.

  



  

(d) Following each of (i) the receipt of a PHC Ruling, (ii) the expiration
of the statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof in
accordance with this Agreement and the application of Section 6501(f) of the
Code) with respect to any PHC Liability related to any Tax Return filed with
respect to any taxable year that (A) ended after January 3, 2004 and (B) ends
on or prior to the Closing Date or includes the Closing Date and (iii) the
completion of any IRS audit of any such taxable year (as evidenced by an IRS
Form 870 or a no change letter), the Stockholder Representative (with the
input and cooperation of the Company and the Company Advisor) shall calculate
and deliver to Parent notice of the PHC Liability (an " _Interim PHC
Liability_ "), which calculation of the Interim PHC Liability shall be
subject to Section 3.07(h). If, in the case of clause (i), one or
more Positive PHC Rulings are received as specified in Section 3.07(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Interim PHC Liability shall be
determined based on the amounts set forth within the applicable scenario (any
such applicable scenario, an " _Alternative_ " and collectively, the "
_Alternatives_ "), which amounts shall be adjusted to take into account (w)
any increase in liability attributable to any PHC Liability related to any
taxable years (or portions thereof) beginning after January 3, 2009 and
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (x) any decrease in
liability attributable to any abatements of penalty that result in the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries incurring a lesser amount of penalties
than is reflected in the applicable Alternative, (y) any increase in
liability attributable to any state and local Taxes attributable to the
inclusion of amounts in respect of consent dividends in income and (z) any
increase or decrease in liability, as applicable, attributable to the amount
of interest actually incurred being greater or less than the amount assumed
in the applicable Alternative (clauses (w) through (z) of this Section
3.07(d), the " _Adjustments_ ").

  



  

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall provide to the Company and Parent
drafts of any amended Tax Returns that the Stockholder
Representative proposes to file; _provided_ that the Stockholder
Representative shall not change any position on a previously filed Tax Return
that does not relate solely to the Companys status as a "personal holding
company" under Section 542 of the Code or the computation of "personal
holding company tax" under Section 541 of the Code. Subject to Section
3.07(h), the Company, at the direction of the Stockholder Representative
shall timely file such amended Tax Returns and remit all Taxes shown as due
on all such Tax Returns. The amount shown as due on such returns may be less
than the Interim PHC Liability at such time. Reasonably prior to making any
payment of Taxes pursuant to this Section 3.07(e), the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall take all actions

  



        
   

  



  

necessary to cause the Escrow Agent to release to the Company an amount from
the Escrow Fund equal to the full amount of such Taxes. Any Tax Returns
filed pursuant to this Section 3.07(e) will be filed with any attachments,
disclosure, or other information as is required to avoid the imposition of
penalties under Section 6662 of the Code, the United States Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other provision of Applicable Law.
The Company shall, at the direction of the Stockholder Representative, file
any amended Tax Return for the purpose of requesting any available refunds
from the IRS to the extent that such refunds relate to the Companys status
as a "personal holding company" under Section 542 of the Code or the
computation of "personal holding company tax" under Section 541 of the Code;
_provided_ that no such amended Tax Return shall be required to be filed
unless a draft of such amended Tax Return was delivered to Parent and the
Company, which draft was subject to Section 3.07(h).

  



  

(f) The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to recover from the
Escrow Fund its reasonable out of pocket costs, expenses and disbursements
incurred after the Closing Date (including the reasonable fees of the
Stockholder Representatives Advisor or any other advisors or counsel and any
fees and expenses required to be paid by the Stockholder Representative under
the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Stockholder Representatives share
of the fees of the Expert) related to the PHC Rulings in an amount not to
exceed $500,000. As soon as practicable after the end of each month and upon
the Final PHC Liability Release Date, the Stockholder Representative shall
submit to Parent a statement detailing the reasonable costs and expenses for
which it is seeking reimbursement pursuant to this Section 3.07(f), and
Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause the Escrow Agent to release
to the Stockholder Representative an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to
such amount of reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder Representatives entitlement to
reimbursement under this Section 3.07(f) is without regard to any amounts
retained in the Escrow Fund for the Additional Expense Allocation, and the
Stockholder Representative must recover its reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and disbursements under this Section 3.07(f) prior to recovering any
amounts pursuant to Section 3.08(g).

  



  

(g) (i) If the Company is required to pay any amount in respect of a PHC
Liability to any applicable Tax authority, other than in connection with an
amended Tax Return as provided in Section 3.07(e), the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall take all actions necessary to cause the
Escrow Agent to release to the Company an amount from the Escrow Fund
equal to the amount of such payment.

  



  

(ii) Amounts from the Escrow Fund shall be promptly released to the Paying
Agent, subject to Section 3.07(h), for distribution to the Stockholders at
the direction of the Stockholder Representative and pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement as follows; _provided_  that all Escrow Payments with respect
to Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company Performance RSUs shall be
made no later than the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time (at which time
a payment will be made to the holders of such Stock Options, Company RSUs and
Company Performance RSUs in an amount to be agreed by the Stockholder
Representative and the Company based upon a reasonable estimate of the PHC
Liability agreed by the Stockholder Representative and the Company):

  



  

after the determination of an Interim PHC Liability in accordance with
Section 3.07(d) and Section 3.07(h) (an " _Interim PHC Liability Release
Date_ "), an

  



        
   

  



  

amount equal to (x) the amount in the Escrow Fund at the time of the
application of this Section 3.07(g)(ii) without regard to any amounts
retained in the Escrow Fund for the Additional Expense Allocation _less_ (y)
the Interim PHC Liability as so determined, _less_  (z) the reasonable costs,
expenses and disbursements of the Stockholder Representative that have not
been reimbursed prior to such time in accordance with Section 3.07(f), shall
be promptly released to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Stockholders
at the direction of the Stockholder Representative if such amount is greater
than zero; _provided_ that on the first Interim PHC Liability Release Date
(and, to the extent the amount to be released to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Stockholders on such date is less than the Additional
Expense Reimbursement Amount, any subsequent Escrow Release Dates), the
Additional Expense Reimbursement Amount shall be deducted from the amount to
be released to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Stockholders at the
direction of the Stockholder Representative on such Interim PHC Liability
Release Date pursuant to Section 3.08(g).

  



  

The Interim PHC Liability Release Date on which the Interim PHC Liability is
zero (or the date on which the Escrow Fund has no amount remaining therein,
if earlier), shall be the " _Final PHC Liability Release Date_ " (such date,
together with the Interim PHC Liability Release Dates, the dates on which
any amounts are remitted for distribution to the Stockholders pursuant
to Section 3.07(j), and the dates of any releases from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 3.08(g), the " _Escrow Release Dates_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, any amounts for which the Stockholder Representative is
entitled to reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.07(f) or 3.08(g) that have
not been reimbursed prior to such time shall be disbursed on such Final PHC
Liability Release Date.

  



  

(h) Any draft amended Tax Return delivered to Parent pursuant to Section
3.07(e) shall be filed by the Company pursuant to Section 3.07(e), and any
determination of the Interim PHC Liability delivered to Parent pursuant to
Section 3.07(c) shall become the Interim PHC Liability for purposes of this
Section 3.07, in each case five Business Days following delivery thereof to
Parent or such earlier time as Parent shall elect to accept such Tax Return
or determination, unless prior to such date Parent delivers to the
Stockholder Representative written notice of its disagreement with such
Tax Return or determination based upon one of the items set forth in this
Section 3.07(h) (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "), which Notice of
Disagreement shall specify the nature of any disagreement so asserted.

  



  

A Notice of Disagreement concerning a draft amended Tax Return may only be
provided in the event that Parent believes that there is no reasonable
basis for a position taken in such draft amended Tax Return.

  



  

A Notice of Disagreement concerning a determination of the Interim
PHC Liability may only be provided if (i) Parent believes that there is a
material uncertainty as to the ability of the Company to rely on a PHC Ruling
received by the Company resulting from (A) the assumptions or representations
on which such PHC Ruling is based being incorrect or omitting a fact, (B)
such PHC Ruling containing a misstatement or omission of fact or law, or (C)
such PHC Ruling containing a caveat or similar qualification that raises a
material uncertainty about the applicability of the PHC Ruling to the PHC
Liability; _provided_ that Parent may not submit a Notice of Disagreement in
respect of (A) or (B) if Parent had actual knowledge of such

  



        
   

  



  

assumption or representation being incorrect or omitting such fact, or of
such misstatement or omission of fact or law, but did not propose any
modification to such items in its comments permitted under Section 3.07(b) or
its comments permitted under Section 3.07(c)); or (ii) Parent disagrees with
the calculation of Interim PHC Liability; _provided_  that if such
calculation is based on one or more Alternatives, Parent may only object to
the calculation of the Adjustments.

  



  

If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Parent to the Stockholder
Representative in a timely manner, then the draft amended Tax Return shall be
filed by the Company pursuant to Section 3.07(e) or the determination of the
Interim PHC Liability shall become final for purposes of this Section 3.07,
as applicable, on the earlier of (a) the date upon which the Stockholder
Representative and Parent agree in writing as to the amended Tax Return or
the determination of the Interim PHC Liability, as the case may be, and (b)
the date any disputed matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are
finally resolved in writing by KPMG LLP (or an alternative nationally
recognized accounting firm or law firm with the relevant tax expertise agreed
upon in writing by the Company, Parent and the Stockholder Representative)
(the " _Expert_ ") in accordance with this Section 3.07(h).

  



  

During the two Business Day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such two
Business Day period (or such longer period as the Stockholder Representative
and Parent mutually agree) the Stockholder Representative and Parent have not
resolved any such differences, the Stockholder Representative and Parent
shall promptly submit to the Expert for resolution any and all matters that
were included in the Notice of Disagreement and remain in dispute.

  



  

The Expert shall be instructed to render its determination of all matters
submitted to it within ten Business Days following submission and to
determine (i) in the case of a Notice of Disagreement related to a draft
amended Tax Return, whether the Company has a reasonable basis for the
positions in such draft amended Tax Return challenged by Parent; (ii) in the
case of a Notice of Disagreement related to the ability of the Company to
rely on a PHC Ruling, whether it would be in a position to, if requested,
provide a "should" level opinion (as such term is customarily understood by
legal and tax accounting professionals) that the Company can rely on such PHC
Ruling, but such an opinion shall not be required to be provided; (iii) in
the case of a Notice of Disagreement related to the calculation of Interim
PHC Liability, the correct amount of Interim PHC Liability, _provided_  that
if such calculation is based on one or more Alternatives, the Expert may only
render its decision as to the amount of Adjustments determined pursuant
to Section 3.07(d) and (iv) whether such matters are eligible for
a determination by the Expert with respect thereto under this Section 3.07.

  



  

If the Expert does not approve a draft amended Tax Return (as described under
clause (i) of the immediately preceding paragraph), such Tax Return may not
be filed with the IRS, but the Stockholder Representative may propose a
different draft amended Tax Return that will be subject to the provisions set
forth in this Section 3.07. If the Expert determines that it would not be in
a position to, if requested, provide an opinion that the Company should
be entitled to rely on a PHC Ruling (as described under clause (ii) of
the immediately preceding paragraph), the Stockholder Representative may not
use such PHC Ruling as a basis to determine

  



        
   

  



  

the Interim PHC Liability, but the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to attempt to receive from the IRS an amendment to such PHC Ruling
that shall be subject to Section 3.07(d) and this Section 3.07(h). If the
Expert corrects a calculation of Interim PHC Liability (as described in
clause (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph), the amount to be
released from the Escrow Fund, if any, shall be determined pursuant to
Section 3.07(g) based on the Experts corrected amount of Interim PHC
Liability.

  



  

The determination of the Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the parties.  The Company, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
irrevocably waive their right to any form of appeal, review or recourse in
any court or other judicial authority. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Expert in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees of the Expert
shall be shared equally by the Company and the Stockholder Representative;
_provided_ that such fees to be paid by the Stockholder Representative shall
be recoverable from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 3.07(f).

  



  

(i) In the event that (i) (A) the Company fails to obtain a ruling
indicating that the Company does not meet the definition of a "personal
holding company" under Section 542 of the Code, or (B) the Company does
obtain such a ruling, but the Expert, pursuant to Section 3.07(h), determines
that it would not be in a position to, if requested, provide an opinion that
the Company should be entitled to rely on such ruling, and (ii) (A) the
Company fails to obtain a ruling under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
301.9100-1 granting an extension of time to file IRS Forms 972 and 973 to
make consent dividends for all open years, or (B) the Company does obtain
such a ruling, but the Expert, pursuant to Section 3.07(h), determines that
it would not be in a position to, if requested, provide an opinion that the
Company should be entitled to rely on such ruling, the Company and Parent
agree that (x) they shall consider in good faith other alternatives proposed
by the Stockholder Representative and the Company to mitigate any PHC
Liability (including but not limited to the alternative set forth in Section
3.07(i)(x) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) to the extent such
alternatives would not reasonably be expected to have a material negative
impact on the Company and (y) the steps specified in Section 3.07(i)(y) of

such earlier dates and in such amounts as the Stockholder Representative
determines in good faith is fair and equitable. In no event shall the
Additional Expense Allocation be available to pay any amounts to which Parent
may be entitled under this Agreement.

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Company
Subsidiary is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The
audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly
financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of the
Company included in the SEC Documents when filed complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in all material respects in accordance

been and are not expected to be individually or in the aggregate material to

Indebtedness, liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued,

of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with
respect to the SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.

  



  

(c) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange

reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (B) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, (C) that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with the authorization of
management and directors of the Company and (D) regarding prevention or
timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the Companys financial
statements.

  



  

(d) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) of the Company are designed to ensure that
all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  



  

(e) Since December 29, 2007, the Company has not received any oral or
written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material
weakness" in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. There
is no outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" which the
Companys independent accountants certify has not been appropriately and
adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the
terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the
meanings assigned to them in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that
its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX,
without qualification, when next due.

statements made or incorporated by reference in the Information Statement
based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.
The Information Statement will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Balance Sheet, in each case free and clear of all mortgages, liens, security
interests, charges, options or rights of first refusal to purchase or lease
or otherwise acquire any interest, title retention agreements, adverse claims
of ownership or use, leases, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), except (i) Liens imposed by law, including

of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any term or
condition of closing in the Financing Commitments will not be timely
satisfied, or that any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will
otherwise not be available to Parent to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby at the time required pursuant to
this Agreement. As of the date hereof, Parent has fully paid any and all

(including Regulation 14C and Schedule 14C promulgated under the
Exchange Act) in connection with the Stockholder Approval, including (i)
delivering the Information Statement to the Companys stockholders as
required pursuant to the Exchange Act and (ii) giving prompt notice of the
taking of the actions described in the Merger Consent in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL to all holders of Common Stock not executing the

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Information
Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts as promptly as
practicable (and after consultation with Parent) to respond to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. The Company
will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement to be
mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after

Statement (or that the Information Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed
by the SEC). Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cooperate with the Company
in the preparation of the Information Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary will
furnish to the Company the information relating to it and its Affiliates
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Information Statement, that is customarily
included in information statements prepared in connection with transactions

SECTION 6.03. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, or authorize or
permit any of their respective directors, officers or employees or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor,
agent or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") retained by it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or
indirectly through another Person (and it shall instruct, and cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries to instruct, each such Representative not to), (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-
public information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary), or take
any other action designed to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or (ii)
engage, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or otherwise cooperate with any Person in any way relating to, or which
would reasonably be likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, in
response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal by such party,
and which Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not result
from a breach of this Section 6.03, the Company may, subject to compliance
with this Section 6.03 with respect to such Takeover Proposal, (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which need not restrict
such Person from making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal) not less
restrictive of such Person in terms of confidentiality restrictions than the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Takeover Proposal.

  



  

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any
Person (including within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act) (other than Parent and its subsidiaries) relating to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any proposal or offer relating to,
in one transaction or a series of transactions, (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of assets (including for the purpose of this
definition the outstanding equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries) or
businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more
of the total equity securities of the Company, (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group
beneficially owning 15% or more of the total equity securities of the Company
or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any

  



        
   

  



  

Person or group or the stockholders of any Person or group would own 15% or
more of the total equity securities of the Company or of any resulting parent
company of the Company or businesses or assets that constitute 15% or more of
the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than, in the case of each of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Takeover
Proposal, that if consummated would result in such Person (or its
stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity
in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a
merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company which the Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be
(i) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point
of view than the Merger and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal (including the likelihood of consummation), in each case,
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by
Parent in response to such Takeover Proposal or otherwise.

  



  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
change, qualify, withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary), or publicly propose to change, qualify, withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors or
any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve
or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.03(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or
resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
may (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law or (y) if the
Company and Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with
this Section 6.03, allow the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to enter
into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law and
thereafter effect any transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may only take the
actions described in clause (y) if at such time the Company is permitted to
terminate, and terminates, this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii)
concurrently with entering into such Acquisition Agreement and pays the
Termination Fee in compliance with Section 6.07(b).

  



        
   

  



  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after
receipt) advise Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Takeover Proposal, and any inquiry or request for information from, or any
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or its
Representatives concerning a Takeover Proposal. The Companys notice
shall include a written summary of the material terms and conditions
(including any financial terms and any other material term thereof) of such
Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request, including the identity of the Person
making any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request.  The Company shall
keep Parent informed of the status and material terms and conditions
(including any change to the financial terms or any other material term
thereof) or developments of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request
and any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and
conditions thereof.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a
statement required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (y) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company, if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside counsel), failure
to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under Applicable
Law, including the Board of Directors duty of candor to the stockholders of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or
the Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to
take, any action prohibited by this Section 6.03 (it being understood that
any accurate disclosure of factual information required to be made under
Applicable Law shall not be considered a modification prohibited by Section
6.03).

  



  

SECTION 6.04. _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its accountants, counsel
and other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to the
properties, books, contracts, commitments, Tax Returns and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to those employees of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to whom Parent reasonably requests access (such
access, in the case of employees other than executive officers of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, to be coordinated through one or more employees of
the Company designated by it and, in no case, shall include the right to
conduct any environmental testing, including soil or groundwater sampling or
other invasive testing procedures), and, during such period shall make
available to Parent any information concerning the Company or a Company
Subsidiary as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access (a) does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (b) does not, in the reasonable
determination of the Company, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or contravene any Applicable Law
or any Contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party or subject; _provided_  that the parties shall with respect to clauses
(a) and (b) above, to the extent possible, make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which such restrictions apply.

  



  

SECTION 6.05. _Confidentiality_. Parent acknowledges that the
information being provided to it in connection with the Merger and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement between Blackstone

  



        
   

  



  

Management Partners L.L.C. and an affiliate of the MP Stockholder, the terms
of which extend to the Company as an express third-party beneficiary thereof
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference.

  



  

SECTION 6.06. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including taking all actions
reasonably necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may
be imposed on it or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Closing. Each party
shall not take any actions that would, or that would reasonably be expected
to, result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII not being
satisfied. Without limiting the foregoing or the provisions set forth in
Section 6.06(b), each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Date.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable (i) but
in no event later than 10 calendar days following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if any, required for
the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make such
other filings as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply with
all Foreign Merger Control Laws as provided in Section 6.06(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Foreign Merger Filings_ ") and shall
as promptly as reasonably practicable provide any supplemental
information requested by applicable Governmental Entities relating thereto.
Any such notification and report form, Foreign Merger Filing or supplemental
information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
HSR Act and such other Foreign Merger Control Laws, as applicable. Each of
the Company and Parent shall consult with one another (and their
respective advisers) as to the form and content of any notification and
report form, Foreign Merger Filing or supplemental information supplied to
any Governmental Entity, and allow the Company or the Parent, as applicable
(and their respective advisers) to review the same (as may be redacted to
remove any estimate of the valuation of the Company, its business or shares,
any identification of or discussion with respect to other potential acquirers
or to preserve any applicable privilege) in advance of submission and make
such amendments as either may reasonably request.  Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and such other
Foreign Merger Control Laws as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order
to comply with all Foreign Merger Control Laws. The Company and Parent shall
keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and
any other applicable Governmental Entity and shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any such inquiry or request and shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable provide any supplemental information requested in
connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act and such
other Foreign Merger Control Laws, as applicable, and, to the extent
permitted by any Governmental Entity: (i) to the extent reasonably
practicable, inform each party prior to all material communications
(including material telephone calls and meetings) with a Governmental Entity,
(ii) allow either party the opportunity to participate in any such calls and
meetings to the extent reasonably practicable, and (iii) allow each party
(and their respective advisers) to review any material written communications
before submission and to make such amendments to such

  



        
   

  



  

communications as either the Company or the Parent may reasonably request.
Each party shall provide the other (and their advisers) with a final copy of
any notification, report form or any other supplemental information submitted
to and any other material written communications with any Governmental
Entity, to the extent permitted by law. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act and such
other Foreign Merger Control Laws for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to a request for an early
termination of the waiting period thereunder. Parent shall be solely
responsible for any filing fees under the HSR Act and such other Foreign
Merger Control Laws. For purposes of this Section 6.06, the "reasonable best
efforts" of Parent shall include promptly opposing any motion or action for a
temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against the Merger or any
portion thereof, but under no circumstances will Parent, the Company or any
of their Affiliates be required to commit and effect, by undertaking, consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, to the sale, divestiture, license
or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of
their Affiliates, or otherwise to take or offer to commit to take any action
(including any action that limits their freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, any of
the business, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent, the
Company or any of their Affiliates), or agree to any other remedy as a
condition to obtaining any clearance required under the HSR Act or any other
Foreign Merger Control Law. Parent and its Subsidiaries shall refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action (including engaging in, or
agreeing to engage in, transactions in the industries in which the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries operate) that would reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent clearance under the HSR Act or any other applicable Foreign
Merger Control Law for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from third parties
necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of the Merger (including
in connection with making or executing any submissions, certifications or
agreements necessary to comply with any applicable requirements of the New
Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act or similar real property transfer law);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no party shall be required to pay or commit to
pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom
any such Consent may be required (other than nominal filing or application
fees). Parent acknowledges that the Consents and waivers with respect to the
Merger may be required from parties to certain Contracts as specified on
Section 4.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Specified
Consents_ ") and that such Specified Consents and waivers may not be obtained
by Closing.  Other than in connection with a breach of this Section 6.06(c),
the Company shall not have any liability whatsoever to Parent arising out of
or relating to the failure to obtain any Specified Consents. Parent
acknowledges that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
contained herein shall be breached or deemed inaccurate or breached, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of the failure to obtain
any Specified Consent.

  



  

SECTION 6.07. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. (a) Whether or not the Merger
is consummated, and except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement and in this Section 6.07 all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing,
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, including any
costs and

  



        
   

  



  

expenses pursuant to Section 6.06; _provided_ that Parent shall bear and pay
the filing fees, if any, incurred under the HSR Act or in connection with any
Foreign Merger Control Law.

  



  

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii) or (ii) (A) prior to the termination of this
Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to
the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become
publicly known, or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover
Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i) and (C) within 12 months after
such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract
to consummate, or consummates, any Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall
pay Parent a fee equal to $8,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of same-day funds on the first Business Day following (x) in
the case of a payment required by clause (i) above, the date of
termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment required
by clause (ii) above, the date of the first to occur of the events referred
to in clause (ii)(C). For purposes of clause (ii)(C) of the immediately
preceding sentence only, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 6.03(a), except that all references to "15%"
therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
acknowledges that in the event it is entitled to receive the Termination Fee,
Parents right to receive such amount shall constitute Parents sole and
exclusive remedy for the termination of this Agreement regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such termination and Parent shall have no
further rights, directly or indirectly, against any other party hereto or any
of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, directors,
officers and agents, whether at law or equity, or in contract.

  



  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 9.01(c)(i), the Company shall pay to Parent the documented
fees and expenses (including, fees and expenses of counsel and other
advisors) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether incurred before or after
the date hereof, including without limitation reasonable and documented fees
and expenses incurred in connection with its investigation, structuring,
financing, negotiation, due diligence, and financial, operating, legal and
other analysis with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(e) All transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation. Each party
shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions from
any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the other parties hereto
in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to
obtain such exemptions.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 6.08. _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company or MP Stockholder shall
deliver to Parent on or before the Closing a certificate, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and as will permit Parent to
effect the transactions contemplated hereby without withholding pursuant to
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act.

  



  

SECTION 6.09. _Publicity_. The initial press release or
announcement announcing the execution of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be in a form reasonably agreed in advance by the
parties hereto. From the date of such announcement through the Closing Date,
and so long as this Agreement is in effect, none of the Company, Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of the
other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except in connection with a Takeover
Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or as may be required by
law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party wanting to
make such press release or other announcement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may make
internal announcements to their respective employees and Affiliates after
reasonable prior notice to and consultation with the other parties hereto.

  



  

SECTION 6.10. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to the limitations set
forth herein, including Section 6.06 and Section 6.12), as such other
party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including executing and
delivering such assignments, deeds, bills of sale, consents and other
instruments as may be reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

SECTION 6.11. _Agreement to Defend and Indemnify_. (a) For six years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, to provide officers and directors liability insurance
covering each Person who is currently, or will be on the Closing Date,
covered by the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries officers and
directors liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time, all on terms no less favorable in the aggregate
than such insurance maintained in effect by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries existing as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in
excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company under its
current policies; _provided_ _further_ , however, that if the premium of
such insurance exceeds the foregoing limit, the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to obtain and maintain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such limit.

  



  

(b) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of present or
former directors, officers,

  



         
 

  



  

employees and agents pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws (in each case, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of the Company are contract rights
and agree to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor such rights in
accordance with their terms, and further agree that such rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation shall not be
modified or amended in any way as to adversely affect the rights of any
Person covered by this Section 6.11.

  



  

(c) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the closing of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each covered or indemnified Person referred to in Sections 6.11(a) and
6.11(b), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.
 Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
indemnified Person, his heirs or representatives, in successfully enforcing
the rights provided in this Section 6.11.

  



  

SECTION 6.12. _Financing_. (a) Parent shall not agree to or permit
any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, any Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing, if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
reduces the aggregate amount of Financing or would reasonably be likely to
delay or prevent the Closing or make any portion of the financing less likely
to occur ( _provided_  that Parent may replace or amend the Debt Financing
Commitments solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof; Parent shall promptly provide notice to
the Company of such replacement or amendment) and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into
the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent set forth therein and (iii) subject to the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments, consummate
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments at the Closing,
including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and any
other Persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to
consummate the Merger at the Closing (including by enforcing its rights under
the Financing Commitments). In the event that any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitments, other than due to the breach of
representations and warranties or covenants of the Company or a failure of a
condition to be satisfied by the Company, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such portion
from alternative sources, on terms not less favorable,

  



        
   

  



  

taken as a whole, to Parent, that will still enable Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent with any portion of
the Debt Financing.  Parent shall refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in
any definitive agreement related to the Financing.  Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a timely basis in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to obtain the Financing.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any Representative retained by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to provide, such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing (which for purposes of this Section 6.12(b), shall include
any alternative financing) as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including (i) participation in meetings, presentations, drafting sessions and
due diligence with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies in
connection with the Financing, (ii) furnishing Parent and its Financing
Sources as promptly as practicable with financial, business and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by Parent to consummate the Debt Financing,
including, all financial, business and other pertinent information related to
the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries reasonably required by Parent for
Parent to produce the financial statements and other offering document
information to consummate the Debt Financing, including all financial
statements, pro forma financial statements, financial and other data of the
type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
and of type and form customarily included in an offering memorandum under
Rule 144A of the Securities Act (information required to be delivered
pursuant to this clause (ii) being referred to as the " _Required
Information_ "), (iii) assisting Parent and its Financing Sources in the
preparation of (A) an offering memorandum, bank information memoranda,
private placement memoranda and similar documents, including "roadshow" or
investor meeting slides required for any portion of the Debt Financing
(including requesting any consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to the Financing and the delivery of one or more
customary representation letters) and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of
Parent and its Financing Sources for any portion of the Debt Financing, (v)
reasonably cooperating with the pledging of collateral in connection with the
Debt Financing, including facilitating the preparation of any customary
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements or
other definitive financing documents or other certificates, legal opinions,
surveys and title insurance (including non-imputation title policy
endorsements and affidavits reasonably required by the title company) and
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that the
obligations contained in any related documents shall be effective no earlier
than as of the Closing), (vi) providing to the Financing Sources
a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters as of the Closing on a
pro forma basis, (vii) providing to the Financing Sources of the Debt
Financing all documentation and other information required by regulatory
authorities with respect to the Company under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation
the PATRIOT Act, (viii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants
comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as

  



        
   

  



  

reasonably requested by Parent and (ix) facilitating the execution and
delivery (at the Closing) of definitive documents related to the Financing on
the terms contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments; _provided_ , that
such definitive documents shall be executed by officers of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time. Except as set forth in this Section 6.12, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall be responsible for all fees and expenses related to the Debt
Financing contemplated hereby. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 6.07, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than any information provided by or on behalf of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries but which shall be subject to Section
6.10). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Companys and
Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that
such logos are used in a manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their marks and on such other
customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose.

  



  

(c) Not less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent payoff letters from third-party lenders in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with respect to all Indebtedness
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries identified on Section 6.12(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such payoff letters shall correctly specify
the amount, including any applicable premiums or fees and expenses, necessary
to repay such Indebtedness and completely discharge the obligations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect thereto, and each shall
acknowledge that, subject to the repayment of the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the relevant debt instrument, credit facility or other
instrument, together with all interest accrued thereon and any other fees or
expenses payable thereunder, (i) such debt instrument, credit facility or
other instrument has been terminated, (ii) any and all Liens held by any
Person under the relevant debt instrument, credit facility or debt instrument
have been released and (iii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
been released from any and all liabilities and obligations under such debt
instruments, credit facility or other instrument and any related guaranties
(other than any obligation under any indemnification or similar provision
that by its terms survives such termination).

  



  

SECTION 6.13. _No Financing Condition_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned upon the consummation of
the Financing and, accordingly, the parties hereto agree that a failure of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement resulting from a failure or inability to consummate the Financing
constitutes a breach for purposes of this Agreement, enforceable subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 9.02(c).

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 6.14. _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, if requested by the
Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory

of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 7.01. Nothing in this Agreement shall be

 _Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

  



  

SECTION 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the
Stockholder Approval:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company
at any time prior to the Effective Time;

  



  

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

  



  

(i)  if the Merger shall not have occurred prior to February 8, 2011 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal
cause of or directly resulted in the failure of the Effective Time to occur
prior to such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, the Buyers failure to close due
to the unavailability of the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is
being used in accordance with Section 6.12, such alternative financing)
shall not be deemed to be an action or failure to act for purposes of this
Section 9.01 (b)(i) so long as Parent has performed in all material respects
its obligations under Section 6.12(a)) and (B) in the event that
the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 (other than the conditions set
forth in Section 8.01(c)), 8.02 and 8.03 (in each case other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied but the condition set forth in Section 8.01(c) was not

  



        
   

  



  

satisfied by the Outside Date, Parent will seek a three month extension of
the Debt Financing Commitments on terms not less favorable, in the aggregate,
as those set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments (for the avoidance of
doubt, without the payment of any additional fees, an increase in any
interest rate or a change to any "flex" provisions); if such extension is
obtained, Parent or the Company may, by delivery of a written notice to the
other party, change the Outside Date to May 6, 2011 (or such earlier date as
mutually agreed by the Parent and the Company); or

  



  

(ii)  if any Restraint preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in
effect and shall have become final and nonappealable.

  



  

(c) by Parent:

  



  

(i)  if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained by 11:59 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date hereof; or

  



  

(ii)  if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.02(a) or (b) and (B)
is incapable of being cured by the Company by the Outside Date, or,
if capable of being cured by the Company by the Outside Date, is not cured by
the Company within 45 calendar days following receipt of written notice
of such breach or failure to perform from Parent; _provided_ that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.01(c)(ii) if Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants set
forth in this Agreement which breach or failure to perform would give rise to
the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.03(a) or (b).

  



  

(d) by the Company:

  



  

(i)  if Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.03(a) or (b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured by Parent or Merger Subsidiary by the Outside Date
or, if capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Subsidiary by the Outside
Date, is not cured by Parent or Merger Subsidiary within 45 calendar days
following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from
the Company; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01 (d)(i) if the Company
shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement which breach or failure
to perform would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.02(a) or (b);

  



        
   

  



  

(ii)  at any time prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval to accept a
Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of Section 6.03(b)(y);or

  



  

(iii)  if (x) all the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 shall
have been satisfied and (y) Parent breaches its obligation to consummate
the Closing at the time on which the Closing was required to occur pursuant
to Section 2.02.

  



  

SECTION 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. (a) If this Agreement is terminated
by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(iii), then Parent shall pay to
the Company a termination fee of $15,000,000 in cash; _provided_ , _however_
 that solely in the circumstances where the Company is entitled to seek
specific performance pursuant to Section 10.07(b) other than clause (iv)
thereof, the termination fee shall be $30,000,000 in cash (such payment, as
applicable, the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), such payment to be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, within three Business Days
following such termination.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
are abandoned as described in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall become null
and void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions
of Section 6.05 relating to the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
to keep confidential certain information and data obtained by them and for
the provisions of (a) Section 6.07 relating to certain expenses, (b) Section
6.09 relating to publicity, (c) Section 9.01 and (d) this Section 9.02, each
of which, solely in accordance with its respective terms, shall survive
indefinitely.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 6.07(c)
and Section 9.02(c), the termination of this Agreement shall not be deemed
to release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent
and Merger Subsidiary fail to effect the Closing when required by Section
2.02 for any reason or otherwise breach this Agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or fail to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, (i)
except for an order of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by Section 10.07, the Companys and its Affiliates sole
and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Investor and any of their
respective former, current and future direct or indirect equityholders,
controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, Financing Sources
or assignees (each a " _Related Party_ " and collectively, the " _Related
Parties_ ") or any Related Party of a Related Party for any breach, loss or
damage shall be (x) to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, in each case, only to the extent provided by Section
9.02(a) or pursuant to the Limited Guarantee, as applicable or (y) to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 (d)(i) and seek to recover
monetary damages from Parent, _provided_  that in no event shall Parent be
subject to monetary damages in excess of $15,000,000 in the aggregate, and
(ii) except as provided in the immediately foregoing clause (i), none of the
Related Parties or any Related Party of a Related Party will have any
Liability to any Person, including the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the
Financing Commitments or in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law

  



        
   

  



  

or equity in contract, in tort or otherwise. Nothing in this Section 9.02
shall limit the rights of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
Representatives pursuant to Section 6.12(b).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a court of competent
jurisdiction has ordered Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 9.02(a), the Company shall not be permitted or entitled to enforce
such order if (x) Parent delivers to the Company, within five (5) Business
Days following the issuance of such order, a notice electing to consummate
the Closing in accordance with Article 2 and (y) the Closing occurs within
ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of such notice.  In no event
shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of
this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in Section 10.07. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the
extent expressly permitted by Section 10.07 and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee only to the extent expressly permitted by Section
9.02(a), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both such grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee.

  



  

SECTION 9.03. _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of
the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement
and in any document delivered in connection herewith shall survive the
Effective Time, except those covenants that by their terms explicitly relate
to periods of time after the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 9.04. _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto. By an instrument in writing, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company,
on the other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or
provision of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to
comply with or perform.

 _General Provisions_

  



  

SECTION 10.01. _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any party
(including by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation
of such party) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
except that each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary may assign all or any of its
rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent; _provided_ ,

SECTION 10.04. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto.

  



  

SECTION 10.05. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, along with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and
thereto, contain the entire agreement and understanding among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. None of the
parties hereto shall be liable or bound to any other party in any manner
by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such subject
matter except as specifically set forth herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 10.06. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or
any portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any
portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of
such provision to any other Persons or circumstances.

  



  

SECTION 10.07. _Specific Performance; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. (a) The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. It
is accordingly agreed that, subject to the limitation set forth in Section
10.07(b), the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof
of actual damages. Each party further agrees that (i) no other party hereto
or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in

  



        
   

  



  

this Section 10.07, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument and (ii) it will not oppose the granting of such remedy on
the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, it
is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and
to consummate the Merger only in the event that (i) Parent and Merger
Subsidiary are required to complete the Closing pursuant to Section 2.02,
(ii) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with Section 6.12, pursuant to commitments with respect thereto)
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to complete
the Closing in accordance with Section 2.02 and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with Section 6.12, pursuant to commitments with respect thereto)
are funded, then the Closing pursuant to Section 2.02 will occur.  For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing (or, if alternative
financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.12, pursuant to
commitments with respect thereto) has not been funded (or will not be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

  



  

(c) Any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and each party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such
proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the proceeding
shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring
any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in any other court.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing Commitments or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

  



  

SECTION 10.08. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other
jurisdiction.

  



  

SECTION 10.09. _Conflict Waiver_. Recognizing that Cravath, Swaine and Moore
LLP has acted as advisor to the Company prior to the Closing, Parent hereby
waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause the Company to
waive, effective as of the Closing, any conflicts that may arise in

of

  



  

POLYMER GROUP, INC.

  



  

FIRST. The name of the Corporation is Polymer Group, Inc.

  



  

SECOND. The registered office and registered agent of the Corporation in the
State of Delaware is The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street,
Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, 19801.

  



  

THIRD. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General
Corporation Law or any successor statute.

  



  

FOURTH. The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share.

  



  

FIFTH. The Board of Directors of the Corporation, acting by majority vote, is
expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the
Corporation. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed
by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but any Bylaws
adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by
the stockholders entitled to vote thereon.  Election of directors need not
be by written ballot.

  



  

SIXTH. (a) No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her
fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent that such exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law as currently in effect or as the same may hereafter be
amended. Any repeal or modification of this subsection (a) of this Article
SIXTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any
right or protection of a director, officer or the Corporation existing at the
time of such repeal or modification. If the Delaware General Corporation Law
is amended after the filing of this Certificate of Incorporation to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as so amended.  All references herein to a director or
officer shall be references to current and former directors or officers of
the Corporation.

  



  

(b) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or testifies in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, claim, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or

        
   

  



  

investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise,
against all claims, losses, liabilities, expenses (including attorneys fees
and disbursements), damages, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware
General Corporation Law, and the Corporation may adopt Bylaws or enter into
agreements with any such person for the purpose of providing for such
indemnification.

  



  

(c) To the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article SIXTH, or in defense
of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith.

  



  

(d) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director
in defending or testifying in a civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, claim, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that
such person is or was an officer or director of the Corporation (or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit
plan, trust or other enterprise) shall be paid by the Corporation in advance
of the final disposition of such action, claim, suit or proceeding within ten
business days of the Corporations receipt of a request for advancement of
such expenses from such director or officer and, to the extent required by
law, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of any such director or
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation
against such expenses as authorized by the relevant sections of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, and the Corporation may adopt Bylaws or enter into
agreements with such persons for the purpose of providing for such advances.

  



  

(e) The indemnification permitted by this Article SIXTH shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding an office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person. To assure indemnification
under this Article SIXTH of all current and former directors and officers who
are determined by the Corporation or otherwise to be or to have been
"fiduciaries" of any employee benefit plan of the Corporation which may exist
from time to time, Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law shall,
for the purposes of this Article SIXTH, be interpreted as follows: "other
enterprise" shall be deemed to include such an employee benefit plan,
including without limitation, any plan of the Corporation which is governed
by the Act of Congress entitled "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974," as amended from time to time; the Corporation shall be deemed to have
requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance by
such person of his duties to the Corporation also imposes duties on, or
otherwise involves services by, such person to the plan or participants or
beneficiaries of the plan; and excise taxes assessed on a

  



        
   

  



  

person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to such Act of
Congress shall he deemed "fines."

  



  

(f) The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance
to protect itself and any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or while a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, employee benefit plan trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any
such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the Delaware General Corporation Law or the provisions of
this Article SIXTH or otherwise.

  



  

SEVENTH. Except as otherwise agreed in writing between such director and the
Corporation, or as provided below, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
except as may be otherwise agreed in writing between such director and the
Corporation, (a) no director of the Corporation shall have any duty
(fiduciary or otherwise) or obligation, if any, to refrain from (i) engaging
in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries or (ii) doing business with any client, customer or
vendor of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including, in the cases
of clauses (i) or (ii), any such matters as may be Corporate Opportunities
(as defined below); and (b) no officer, director or employee thereof shall be
deemed to have breached any duty (fiduciary or otherwise), if any, to the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or stockholders solely by reason of
any director of the Corporation engaging in any such activity or entering
into such transactions, including any Corporate Opportunities. " _Corporate
Opportunity_ " means any potential transaction, investment or business
opportunity or prospective economic or competitive advantage in which the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries could have any expectancy or interest.

  



  

Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation and its subsidiaries shall
have no interest or expectation in, nor right to be informed of, any
Corporate Opportunity, and in the event that any director of the Corporation
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a
Corporate Opportunity, such director shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, have no duty (fiduciary or otherwise) or obligation to communicate or
offer such Corporate Opportunity to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or to any other director of the Corporation and shall not, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, be liable to the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries or stockholder for breach of any fiduciary duty as a
director or officer of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries solely by
reason of the fact that any director of the Corporation acquires or seeks
such Corporate Opportunity for itself, directs such Corporate Opportunity to
another individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, association,
joint stock company, limited liability company, trust, unincorporated
organization or government or an department or agency or political
subdivision thereof, or otherwise does not communicate information regarding
such Corporate Opportunity to the Corporation or its subsidiaries, and the
Corporation and its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
waive and renounce any claim that such business opportunity constituted
a Corporate Opportunity that should have been presented to the Corporation or
its subsidiaries; _provided_ that if an opportunity is expressly
communicated to a director of the Corporation in his or her capacity as a
director as an

  



        
   

  



  

opportunity intended exclusively for the Corporation or its subsidiaries
(hereinafter called an " _Identified Corporate Opportunity_ "), such
Identified Corporate Opportunity shall belong to the Corporation and its
subsidiaries and, unless the Corporation notifies the stockholders that
neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries intend to pursue such
Identified Corporate Opportunity.

by the Board of Directors, at which meeting the stockholders shall elect a
Board of Directors and transact such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting.

  



  

Section 3. _Special Meetings_. Special Meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or

more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting.

  



  

Section 5. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of
the capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all
meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. If, however,
such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time,
place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by

bearing a later date.  Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by

Annual or Special meeting of stockholders, or any action which may be taken
at any Annual or Special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent shall be given
by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number
of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if

  



        
   

  



  

the record date for such meeting had been the date that consents given by a
sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation.

prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the

stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, as required by applicable law. Except
as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as

Section 10. _Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action without
a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights
in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose
of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date,

Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of

however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 11. _Conduct of Meetings_. The date and time of the opening and
the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will
vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the chairman of the
meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and
regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem
appropriate.  Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and
regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting
of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn
the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do
all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the

stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be
appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not
properly brought before the meeting and if such chairman should so determine,
such person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business
not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or
considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or
the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required

by and among Scorpio Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Polymer Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners L.P., a Delaware limited

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 4,
2010 among the Company, Parent, Scorpio Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Merger Subsidiary_ ") and the Stockholder Representative (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), Merger Subsidiary shall merge with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates the due execution of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement);

  



  

WHEREAS, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent, for the benefit of the Stockholders and
the Company, an amount of cash equal to $64,500,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_
"), subject to reduction pursuant to Section 3.07(l) of the Merger Agreement,
into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Parties desire that the Escrow
Amount be held and distributed in accordance with the provisions of
the Merger Agreement by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is willing to act as escrow agent hereunder on the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Defined Terms_. Unless otherwise indicated, all initially capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings attributed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2. _Appointment_. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

3. _Establishment of Escrow_.

  



  

(a) Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall notify the Escrow Agent and shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, for the benefit of the Stockholders and the
Company, the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount (together with any Earnings (as
defined below) accrued thereon, the " _Escrowed Funds_ ") shall be
held, invested and distributed pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Except as Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative may
otherwise agree to in writing, no part of the Escrowed Funds may be withdrawn
from the Escrow Account except as expressly provided in this Agreement and
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent agrees to hold and
distribute the Escrowed Funds only in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

4. _Investment of Escrow Amount_. The Escrow Amount, and any interest, dividends, earnings or other income received by the Escrow Agent on such investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount (" _Earnings_ "), shall be invested and reinvested in such of the following investments (the " _Permitted Investments_ ") as specified in a written notice from the Stockholder Representative and delivered from time to time to the Escrow Agent:

  



  

(a) direct obligations of the United States or any agency thereof or
obligations guaranteed by the United States or any agency thereof;

  



  

(b) commercial paper with a rating of at least A-1 by Standard and Poors

(c) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. money market deposit accounts, which have rates

through (c) (collectively, "MMMF"), selected by [*] and as set forth in a
written instruction, and as shall be available to the Escrow Agent, based
upon [*] independent review of prospectuses previously delivered to [*].
The Parties acknowledge that an affiliate of Escrow Agent, JPMorgan
Asset Management ("JPMAM"), serves as investment manager for the selected
MMMF and receives fees from the invested funds for services rendered separate
from the fees for services rendered by Escrow Agent as further provided
within this Agreement.

  



  

On the date hereof and until further notice from the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with this Section 4, the Escrow Amount shall
be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent in [*].

  



  

The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest the Escrowed
Funds that are deposited with the Escrow Agent after 12:00 p.m. (Eastern
Time) on such day of deposit. Instructions received after 10:00 a.m.
(Eastern Time) will be treated as if received on the following Business Day.

other day on which the Escrow Agent located at the notice address set forth

closed.

  



  

The Escrow Agent shall have the power to sell or liquidate investments in the

shall have no liability for any

  



        
   

  



  

investment losses resulting from the investment, reinvestment or liquidation
of the Escrowed Funds prior to its maturity or for the failure of the Parties
to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrowed
Funds, except as a result of the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Subject to Section 6, any Earnings shall continue to be held in
the Escrow Account and shall increase the amount of Escrow Amount. Written
investment instructions, if any, shall specify the type and identity of the
investments to be purchased and/or sold. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized
to execute purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its
own trading or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity.
The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with
respect to any investment directed hereunder including without limitation
charging an agency fee in connection with each transaction. The
Stockholder Representative and the Company recognize and agree that the
Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating

herein.

  



  

5. _Disbursements from the Escrow Account_.

Account pursuant to and in accordance with either (i) the joint written
instructions of the Parties; or (ii) the instructions set forth in any
written letter of direction, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto
(the " _Letter of Direction_ "), executed by the Company and the
Stockholder Representative. The Company and the Stockholder Representative
shall execute the Letter of Direction pursuant to Section 3.07 of the Merger
Agreement with respect to disbursements (including reimbursements of the
Stockholder Representatives fees and expenses, to the extent provided in the
Merger Agreement) from the Escrow Account in accordance with Section 3.07 of
the Merger Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first $500,000 to be released by the
Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with paragraph (b) above shall, pursuant to instructions provided
by the Parties in one or more Letters of Direction, be retained by the Escrow
Agent in the Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent shall disburse all or any
portion of such amount pursuant to and in accordance with the instructions
set forth in any certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto
(the " _Stockholder Representative Certificate_ "), executed by the
Stockholder Representative (such funds to be provided for the reimbursement
of fees and expenses of the Stockholder Representative or to be distributed
to the Stockholders, in each case pursuant to Section 3.08(g) of the Merger
Agreement). The Escrow Agent shall act solely upon the instructions that it
receives in accordance with this Section and shall not be responsible for
determining whether the instructions are in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.  The obligations contained in this Section 5 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the resignation, replacement or removal
of the Escrow Agent.

  



  

6. _Fees of Escrow Agent_. The fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, of the Escrow Agent in performing its duties hereunder along with any fees or charges for 

  



        
   

  



  

accounts, including those levied by any governmental authority which the
Escrow Agent may impose, charge or pass-through, which unless otherwise
agreed in writing shall be as described in _Schedule I_  attached hereto,
shall be paid to the Escrow Agent first from any Earnings on the Escrow
Amount remaining in the Escrow Account from time to time and if such Earnings
shall at any time be insufficient, (i) each of the Company and
the Stockholder Representative shall be responsible to pay or cause to be
paid 50% of the remaining portion of such fees and costs and (ii) if any such
Party shall pay more than its share of such fees, such Party shall have a
right of contribution from the other with respect to such fees paid by that
Party. The obligations contained in this Section 6 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the resignation, replacement or removal of
the Escrow Agent.

  



  

7. _Confidentiality_. The Escrow Agent may be provided reasonable access to information regarding the Merger for the sole purpose of performing its duties hereunder; _provided_ that the Escrow Agent shall treat confidentially all non-public information ("Confidential Information"), and shall restrict access to the Confidential Information to those of the Escrow Agents officers, directors, employees, agents, regulators (including the officers, directors, employees, agents and regulators of JPMorgan Chase Bank, NAs corporate parent and those of such parents direct or indirect subsidiaries), and non-employee consultants or advisors, in each case, with a "need to know" for the purposes of administering this Agreement. "Confidential Information" shall not include any information that:

  



  

(a) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the receiving party in violation of an obligation of
confidentiality;

  



  

(b) was lawfully available to the Escrow Agent on a non-confidential basis
prior to the disclosure; or

  



  

(c) becomes lawfully available to the Escrow Agent on a non-confidential
basis from a source other than the Parties or their agents, advisors, or
representatives which such source is entitled, to the best of the Escrow
Agents knowledge, to make the disclosure.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Escrow Agent is requested or required
(by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
any law, regulation, governmental order or judicial order, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, if lawful and not
prejudicial to any legal privilege which may be applicable, the Escrow Agent
shall provide the Parties or Party, as applicable, with prompt notice of such
request(s) or obligations in accordance with Section 17, so that such Parties
may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the Escrow Agents
compliance with the provisions of this Section 7. If, failing the entry of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Escrow Agent is,
in the opinion of the Escrow Agents counsel, compelled or appropriately
requested to disclose Confidential Information under pain of liability for
contempt or other censure, penalty, or adverse consequences the Escrow Agent
may disclose such information without liability hereunder.

  



  

8. _Responsibilities and Liabilities of the Escrow Agent_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent shall administer the Escrowed Funds only in accordance
with this Agreement and to the extent referred to herein.  The Escrow Agent
shall

  



        
   

  



  

have only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein,
which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature and no other duties shall
be implied.  The Escrow Agent assumes no liabilities except those expressed
in this Agreement and shall have no responsibility or liability to any person
with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
good faith under this Agreement, or for any mistake of fact or law, or for
anything that it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except
to the extent that a final adjudication of a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to any Party.  The Escrow Agent
shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have
any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument or document between or among the Parties, in connection
herewith, if any, including without limitation the Merger Agreement (each, an
"Underlying Agreement"), nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine
if any person or entity has complied with any Underlying Agreement, nor shall
any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of
any Underlying Agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in
this Agreement. In the event of any conflict, solely with respect to the
rights or obligations of the Escrow Agent, between the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and those of any Underlying Agreement, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall control. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and
shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any written
notice, document, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper Party or Parties without inquiry and without requiring substantiating
evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire
into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document,
notice, instruction or request.  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any
Party, any beneficiary or other person for refraining from acting upon any
instruction setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to
the transfer or distribution of the Escrowed Funds, or any portion thereof,
unless such instruction shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with Section 24 below and the Escrow Agent has been able to
satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required thereunder. The
Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the
validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or
request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which
may be due it or the Escrow Account, nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty
or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts
deposited with it hereunder.

  



  

(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect
or consequential loss or damages of any kind (including but not limited to
lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood
for such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

  



  

(c) The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any notice, request,
certificate, approval, consent, or other document delivery of which complies
with Section 17 and/or Section 24, as applicable, and that the Escrow Agent
reasonably believes to be genuine and to be signed by the proper Party or
Parties. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of
its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. The Escrow
Agent may act in reliance upon the advice of counsel satisfactory to it in
reference to any matter in connection with this Agreement and shall not incur
any liability for any action taken in good faith in accordance with such
advice. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain 

  



        
   

  



  

or believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties or rights hereunder or
shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in
its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall
be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall
be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be given a
direction in writing by the Company and the Stockholder Representative which
eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent
or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) The Escrow Agent or any Successor Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 12)
hereunder may resign hereunder (i) at any time, with the consent of the
Stockholder Representative and the Company and the appointment of a
substitute Escrow Agent by the Stockholder Representative and the Company;
(ii) upon the petitioning of a court of competent jurisdiction seeking the
appointment of a substitute Escrow Agent and the appointment by such court of
a substitute Escrow Agent; or (iii) upon 30 days written notice to the
Stockholder Representative and the Company and such resignation shall be
effective from the date specified in such notice. If the Parties have failed
to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of **** thirty
(30) days following receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties hereto.  The
Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period
expires shall be to hold the Escrowed Funds (without any obligation
to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute
escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order
or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of delivery
Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to
the provisions of Sections 6, 7 and 9 hereunder.  After receipt of notice of
the Escrow Agents intent to resign, the Stockholder Representative and the
Company will work in good faith to select a substitute Escrow Agent. In case
the office of the Escrow Agent shall become vacant for any reason, the
Stockholder Representative and the Company shall appoint a bank or trust
company with an office in New York City having a net worth (as reflected in
its latest publicly available certified financial statements) in excess of
$1,000,000,000 as the successor Escrow Agent hereunder by an instrument or
instruments in writing delivered by the Stockholder Representative and the
Company to such successor Escrow Agent, whereupon such successor Escrow Agent
shall succeed to all rights and obligations of the retiring Escrow Agent as
if this Agreement were originally executed by such successor Escrow Agent,
and the retiring Escrow Agent shall deliver to such successor Escrow Agent
all amounts in the Escrow Account.

  



  

(e) Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the escrow business of
the Escrow Agent may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.

  



  

(f) Subject to Section 6 and Section 14 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall not
have any interest in the Escrow Account, but shall serve as escrow holder
only and have possession thereof. Any distribution or payment of Earnings
from the Escrow Account shall be subject to withholding regulations then in
force with respect to United States Taxes and as set forth in Section 15
below.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) The Escrow Agent shall acknowledge receipt of the Escrow Amount and shall
hold the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

  



  

9. _Indemnification_. The Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, agents, and employees (the " _indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified by each of the Parties in proportion to such Partys respective responsibility, if any, from and against any and all damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation, investigations and reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of in house or outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively "Losses") arising out of or in connection with (a) the Escrow Agents execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the indemnitee, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such Losses have been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or other directions, whether joint or singular, from the Company and the Stockholder Representative, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnitees shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

11. _Interpleader_. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall at any time be confronted with inconsistent claims or demands by the Parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to interplead said Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction and request that such court determine such respective rights of the Parties with respect to this Agreement, and upon doing so, the Escrow Agent automatically shall be released from any obligations or liability as a consequence of any such claims or demands, except that the Escrow Agent shall not be released from any liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct occurring during the time that it served as Escrow Agent.

  



  

12. _Removal of the Escrow Agent_. The Stockholder Representative and the Company, acting together, shall have the right to remove the Escrow Agent hereunder by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in writing to the Escrow Agent, specifying the date upon which such removal shall take effect. In the event of such removal, the Stockholder Representative and the Company agree that, prior to the effective date of removal of the Escrow Agent, they will jointly appoint a successor to the Escrow Agent (the " _Successor Escrow Agent_ "), and the Escrow Agent hereby agrees that, upon receiving such joint instructions, it shall turn over and deliver to such Successor Escrow Agent the Escrowed Funds in accordance with the terms of such joint instructions and render the accounting required by Section 14.

(i) Each of the Company and the Stockholder Representative shall be responsible for 50% of all reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent for the preparation of such accounting, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and (ii) if any such Party shall pay more than its share of such fees and expenses, such Party shall have a right of contribution from the other with respect to such fees and expenses paid by that Party. This Section shall be subject to Sections 6 and 9 of this Agreement and shall in no way limit any rights granted to the Escrow Agent in Sections 6 and 9 herein.

  



  

15. _Tax Matters._ The Company and the Stockholder Representative have provided the Escrow Agent with the respective fully executed Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-8, or W-9 and/or other required documentation.  The Parties agree that, solely for Tax reporting purposes, all Earnings and fees payable out of such Earnings pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocable to the Company, and the Escrow Agent shall report such Earnings consistently therewith to the IRS on IRS form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) and to any other Taxing authority (on the applicable form or forms), and, except as required by applicable law, the Escrow Agent and the Parties shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return or in any administrative or judicial proceeding.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any Tax Return other than those Tax Returns referred to in the second and last sentences of this Section 15. The Escrow Agent shall withhold any Taxes required to be withheld by applicable law (other than any applicable Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (" _FIRPTA_ ") withholding), and shall timely remit such Taxes, together with any applicable forms (other than FIRPTA reporting forms), to the appropriate authorities.

18. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon or arise out of this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Parties hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement. Each Party and the Escrow Agent irrevocably waive any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New York. To the extent that in any jurisdiction either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment), or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and it hereby irrevocably waives, such immunity.  No Party to this Agreement is liable to any other Party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control.

  



  

19. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

20. _Entire Agreement; Waiver_. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties, on the one hand, and the Escrow Agent, on the 

  



        
   

  



  

other hand, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement and the
Merger Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such
action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by the Escrow Agent or any Party hereto of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed
as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of the Escrow Agent or any Party
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of such right, power or remedy by the Escrow Agent or such Party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy.

  



  

21. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then this Agreement shall be construed with the invalid or inoperative provisions deleted and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

22. _Captions_. The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

23. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto (except as described in the next sentence) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement.

  



  

24. _Security Procedures._ (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary as set forth in Section 17, any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or distribution of funds, including but not limited to any such funds transfer instructions that may otherwise be set forth in a written instruction permitted pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement, may be given to the Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile and no instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrowed Funds, or any portion thereof, shall be deemed delivered and effective unless the Escrow Agent actually shall have received such instruction by facsimile at the number provided to the Parties by the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 17 and as further evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to that number. In the event funds transfer instructions are given, whether in writing or by facsimile, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule II hereto (" _Schedule II_ "), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. Each funds transfer instruction shall be executed by an authorized signatory, a list of such authorized signatories is set forth on Schedule II. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent.  If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified on Schedule II, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized both to receive written instructions from and seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of the 

  



        
   

  



  

Company or the Stockholder Representatives executive officers (the "
_Executive Officers_ "), which shall include, in the case of Stockholder
Representative, those persons with the titles of General Counsel or Chief
Financial Officer and, in the case of the Company, those persons with the
titles of General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer, in each case, as the
Escrow Agent may select.  Such Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely
upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow
Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon
any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Company or
the Stockholder Representative to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the
beneficiarys bank, or (c) an intermediary bank.  The Escrow Agent may apply
any of the Escrowed Funds for any payment order it executes using any such
identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other than the
beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the
beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank designated. The Company and the
Stockholder Representative acknowledge that these security procedures are
commercially reasonable.

  



  

(b)  The Company acknowledges that the Escrow Agent is authorized to use
the following funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to the
Company under this Agreement without a verifying call-back as set forth in
Section 24(a) above:

    |

The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is authorized to use the

Agent under this Agreement without a verifying call-back as set forth in
Section 24(a) above:

  



       

The Paying Agents Bank account information:

    |  

Bank name:

    
---|--- 
     



    |  

Bank Address:

    |  

Account name:

    
     



    |  

Account number:

    
   



  

(c)  In addition to the Paying Agents and their respective funds
transfer instructions as set forth in Section 24(b) above, the Company or
the Stockholder Representative

  



        
   

  



  

acknowledges that repetitive funds transfer instructions may be given to the
Escrow Agent for one or more beneficiaries where only the date of the
requested transfer, the amount of funds to be transferred, and/or the
description of the payment shall change within the repetitive instructions
("Standing Settlement Instructions"). Accordingly, the Company or the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Escrow Agent such
specific Standing Settlement Instructions only for each respective
beneficiary as set forth in Schedule II, by facsimile in accordance with
Section 24. The Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such Standing Settlement
Instructions and all identifying information set forth therein for each
beneficiary. The Escrow Agent and the Company or the Stockholder
Representative agree that such Standing Settlement Instructions shall be
effective as the funds transfer instructions of the Company or the
Stockholder Representative, without requiring a verifying callback, whether
or not authorized, if such Standing Settlement Instructions are consistent
with previously authenticated Standing Settlement Instructions for that
beneficiary.

  



  

(d)  The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set forth in this
Section 24 are commercially reasonable.

  



  

25.   _Compliance with Court Orders_.  In the event that any escrow property shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties hereto or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  



  

26.   _Patriot Act Disclosure_. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (" _USA PATRIOT Act_ ") requires the Escrow Agent to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new account with it.  Accordingly, the Company and Stockholder Representative acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agents identity verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm the Company and Stockholder Representative identity including without limitation name, address and organizational documents (" _identifying information_ "). The Company and the Stockholder Representative agree to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying information required as a condition of opening an account with or using any service provided by the Escrow Agent.

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the date first written above.
