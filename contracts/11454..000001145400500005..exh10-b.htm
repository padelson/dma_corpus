If at the end of the thirty (30) day period specified in subsection (ii) above, Buying Group and Selling Group shall have failed to reach a written agreement with respect to such dispute or Selling Group has not withdrawn its objection, the matter shall be referred to a mutually agreeable nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Arbitrator"), which shall act as an arbitrator and shall issue its report resolving all disputes as to the appropriateness of Buying Group\'s proposed Closing Statements or the proposed Closing Balance Sheet Adjustment or proposed Accounts Receivable Adjustment within sixty (60) days after such dispute is referred to it.

In the event Selling Group and Buying Group have a dispute with regard to the Rx Count, Selling Group and Buying Group agree to submit to immediate arbitration and to use their best efforts to resolve the Rx Count prior to the scheduled Closing Date. A mutually agreeable firm will arbitrate the dispute (the "Rx Arbitrator"), and shall issue its report resolving the dispute, and determine the Rx Count. The scheduled Closing Date will be postponed until the day on which the Rx Arbitrator issues its report setting forth the Rx Count. Each of the parties hereto shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with such arbitration, except that the fees and expenses of the Rx Arbitrator hereunder shall be shared equally by the parties. This provision for arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and the decision of the Rx Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be final and binding and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

reasonable and lawful as to Parent and ProCare, designed to provide such
benefits to Buying Group and (z) at ProCare\'s request, to enforce for the
account and at the expense of ProCare any rights of the Selling Group arising

after the Closing, ProCare shall use reasonable commercial efforts to perform
the obligations of the Selling Group arising under such Assumed Agreements
and permits, to the extent ProCare receives the benefit thereof pursuant to
this Section 3.2(c). Parent and ProCare shall cooperate with each other to
take such actions, including entering into services agreements or similar
arrangements, as are reasonably calcula ted to effectuate the intent of the
preceding sentence. The Purchase Price shall not be reduced or increased by
reason of the non-assignability or subcontracting of any of the Assumed
Agreements. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to waive or excuse any
obligation on the part of a Selling Group Member or any condition for the
benefit of Buying Group to obtain any necessary consents to the transfer or
assignment of any of the Assumed Agreements or other Purchased Assets required
to be transferred or assigned hereunder.

   All instruments to be delivered to Selling Group pursuant
hereto shall be in form and substance, and shall be executed in a manner,
reasonably satisfactory to each Selling Group Member, but shall not function
to increase or decrease the assets being transferred to Buying Group
hereunder or the liabilities and obligations to be assumed by Buying Group
hereunder.

"Physical Inventory") of the Business shall be taken (at Buying Group\'s
expense) by a mutually agreed firm on the day preceding the Closing Date, at
which inventory count Buying Group\'s Accountants and Selling Group\'s
Accountants shall be entitled to observe. The value of the inventory at the
Physical Inventory shall be determined in accordance with the methods and cost
factors listed on _Schedule 3.4_ hereto.

Buying Group shall have the right, at its expense, to undertake such
environmental studies of each of the premises at which any of the Selling
Group Members perform the Business (the "Premises"), including reviewing
records, inspecting the properties and testing the air, subsoil, groundwater
and building materials at the Premises, as it shall deem necessary to
determine whether the Premises are in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws and whether any Hazardous Substances are present at the

any loss, cost, or damage proximately caused by such inspection. Such
inspection shall be scheduled and performed so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the business of the Selling Group.

termination of this Agreement, none of the Selling Group Members nor Parent
nor any of their respective Affiliates, advisors or representatives shall,
directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or initiate any contact with,
negotiate with, or provide any information to, endorse or enter into any
agreement with respect to, or take any other action, directly or indirectly,
to facilitate any person or group, other than Buying Group and its
representatives, concerning any inquiries or the making of any proposals
concerning any merger or combination with a Selling Group Member, or a
purchase or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a Selling Group
Member, or purchase or sale of a substantial equity interest in any Selling
Group Member or any similar transaction involving any Selling Group Member or
Parent (other than solely with respect to the Corrections Division Business).

Selling Group Member shall execute a non-exclusive assignment (the

exclusive basis, all the rights of indemnification relating to the Business or
the Purchased Assets that such Selling Group Member shall have received from
the third-parties identified on _Schedule 6.11_ hereto to the extent that such
Selling Group Member has the right to effect such assignments. At the Buying
Group\'s request, each Selling Group Member will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any necessary consents to each such Assignment.

  

   Section 6.12 _Software Licenses_. Notwithstanding Selling
Group\'s disclosure on _Schedule 4.17_ with respect to an insufficient number
of software licenses, Selling Group and Buying Group agree that Selling Group
retains all liability arising out of such unlicensed use through the Closing
Date and is responsible for procuring a sufficient number of such licenses to
cure such deficiency prior to the Closing Date after consultation with Buying

INDEMNIFICATION

_   

   Section 9.1 _By Each Selling Group Member and the Parent_.
From and after the Closing Date, and regardless of any investigation made at
any time by or on behalf of Buying Group, but subject to the limitations of
this Article IX, each Selling Group Member and the Parent, on a joint and
several basis, agree to reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless each Buying
Group Member and their respective successors and assigns, and any director,
shareholder, employee or officer thereof (an " Indemnified Buyer Party" and
collectively the "Indemnified Buyer Parties") against and in respect of costs
of investigations and any and all damages, losses, claims, deficiencies,
liabilities, suits, demands, judgments, diminution in value, costs and
expenses (including costs of investigations and reasonable attorneys\' fees
(each a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred or suffered by any
Indemnified Buyer Party arising from or relating to:

  

  (a) any and all Non-Assumed Liabilities;

  

  (b) any and all litigation, investigations and reviews described in _Schedules_ _4.21_ , _4.22_ and _4.31_ , including, without limitation, the Counsel Litigation, and any and all other actions, suits, claims, or legal, administrative, arbitration, governmental or other proceedings or investigations (including any audits and recoupments) against any Indemnified Buyer Party that arise out of omissions or events occurring prior to the Closing Date and that relate to a Selling Group Member in their capacity as such or any of their respective predecessors or any shareholder, manager, member, officer, employee, agent, distributor, supplier, representative or subcontractor of any Selling Group Member;

  

  (c) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy in or omission from any representation or warranty made by a Selling Group Member or Parent under this Agreement or any certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument furnished to a Buying Group Member pursuant hereto;

  

  (d) any breach or non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part of a Selling Group Member or Parent under this Agreement to be performed on or following the Closing Date;

  

  (e) without limiting any of the foregoing indemnification provisions, (x) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy in or omission from any representation or warranty made by a Selling Group Member or Parent under Section 4.14 [Tax Matters] of this Agreement, and (y) any and all liabilities of the Selling Group for the payment of any Tax owed by Parent, Parent\'s Affiliates and all Selling Group Members and any Tax incident to or arising as a consequence of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation any interest, additions to tax and penalties that may be assessed with respect thereto; or

   Section 9.2 _Notice of Claims; Defense of Third Party Claims_.
A party claiming indemnification under this Article IX (the "Asserting Party")
must notify (in writing and in reasonable detail) the party from which
indemnification is sought (the "Defending Party") of the nature and basis of
such claim for indemnification. If such claim relates to a claim, suit,
litigation or other action by a third party against the Asserting Party or any
fixed or contingent liability to a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Defending Party may elect to assume and control the defense of the Third Party
Claim at its own expense with counsel selected by the Defending Party from and
after such time as the Defending Party unconditionally agrees in writing to
accept, as against the Asserting Party, all liabilities on account of such
Third Party Claim. Assumption of such liability, as against the Asserting
Party, shall not be deemed an admission of liability as against any such
third p arty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Defending Party may not
assume or control the defense if the named parties to the Third Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Defending Party and the
Asserting Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel (in

or potential differing interests between them, in which case the Asserting
Party shall have the right to defend the Third Party Claim and to employ
counsel reasonably approved by the Defending Party, and to the extent the
matter is determined to be subject to indemnification hereunder, the Defending
Party shall reimburse the Asserting Party for the reasonable costs of its
counsel. If the Defending Party assumes liability for the Third Party Claim
as against the Asserting Party and assumes the defense and control of the
Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.2, the Defending Party shall not
be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel fo r the Asserting Party
incurred thereafter in connection with the Third Party Claim (except in the
case of actual or potential differing interests, as provided in the preceding
sentence), but shall not agree to any settlement of such Third Party
Claim which does not include an unconditional release of the Asserting Party
by the third party claimant on account thereof. If the Defending Party does
not assume liability for and the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to
this Section 9.2, the Asserting Party shall have the right to assume the
defense of and, if such Asserting Party shall have notified the Defending
Party of the Asserting Party\'s intention to negotiate a settlement of the
Third Party Claim, which notice shall include the material terms of any
proposed settlement in reasonable detail, to settle the Third Party Claim (at
the Defending Party\'s expense to the extent the matter is determined to be
subject to indemnification hereunder) on terms not materially inconsistent
with those set forth in s uch notice, unless the Defending Party shall have
notified the Asserting Party in writing of the Defending Party\'s election to
assume liability for and the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Section 9.2 within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice of intention to
settle, and the Defending Party promptly thereafter shall have taken
appropriate action to implement such defense. The Asserting Party shall not be
entitled to settle any such Third Party Claim pursuant to the
preceding sentence unless such settlement includes an unconditional release
by the third party claimant on account thereof. The Asserting Party and the
Defending Party shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate fully with
respect to the defense of any Third Party Claim covered by this Article IX.

  

  Section 9.3 _Set-off_. Buying Group shall have the right,
notwithstanding any other rights it might have against any other Person, to

   Section 10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned, by written notice given
to the other party hereto, at any time prior to the Closing:

  

  (a) by mutual written consent of Buying Group and Selling Group; 

  

  (b) by either Buying Group or Selling Group, if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United States governmental body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buying Group (and in which case Buying Group and Selling Group shall have used all reasonable efforts to have such order, decree, ruling or other action lifted or reversed) and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

  

  (c) by Buying Group, if any Selling Group Member shall have breached any of its representations herein and such breach or breaches, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or if any Selling Group Member shall have materially breached any of its covenants hereunder (and any such breach shall not have been cured to the reasonable satisfaction of Buying Group within 10 days after Buying Group\'s notice to Selling Group of such breach);

  

  (d) by Selling Group, if any Buying Group Member shall have materially breached any of its representations herein and such breach or breaches, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or if any Buying Group Member shall have materially breached any of its covenants hereunder (and any such breach shall not have been cured to the reasonable satisfaction of Selling Group within ten (10) days after Selling Group\'s notice to Buying Group of such breach); or

  

  (e) by either Buying Group or Selling Group if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before October 1, 2000 (the "Outside Date"), unless (i) the parties agree in writing to extend the Outside Date, or (ii) the failure to have the Closing shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing.

  

   Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, written notice thereof
shall be given by the terminating party to the other party specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is being made and the
Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect, and no
party hereto (or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, managers, agents
or representatives) shall have any liability or obligation hereunder (except
for any liability of any party then in breach); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the provisions of all but the first and fourth sentences of Section 6.1
(Access) and all of Section 11.2 (Expenses) shall survive any such
termination.
