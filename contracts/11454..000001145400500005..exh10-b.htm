Section 9.2  </A><U>Notice of Claims; Defense of Third Party Claims</U>.  A party claiming indemnification under this Article IX (the &quot;Asserting Party&quot;) must notify (in writing and in reasonable detail) the party from which indemnification is
sought (the &quot;Defending Party&quot;) of the nature and basis of such claim for indemnification.  If such claim relates to a claim, suit, litigation or other action by a third party against the Asserting Party or any fixed or contingent liability to a
third party (a &quot;Third Party Claim&quot;), the Defending Party may elect to assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim at its own expense with counsel selected by the Defending Party from and after such time as the Defending Party
unconditionally agrees in writing to accept, as against the Asserting Party, all liabilities on account of such Third Party Claim.  Assumption of such liability, as against the Asserting Party, shall not be deemed an admission of liability as against any
such third p
arty.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Defending Party may not assume or control the defense if the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Defending Party and the Asserting Party and representation of
both parties by the same counsel (in such counsel's reasonable determination) would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the Asserting Party shall have the right to defend the Third Party Claim and to
employ counsel reasonably approved by the Defending Party, and to the extent the matter is determined to be subject to indemnification hereunder, the Defending Party shall reimburse the Asserting Party for the reasonable costs of its counsel.  If the
Defending Party assumes liability for the Third Party Claim as against the Asserting Party and assumes the defense and control of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.2, the Defending Party shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of
counsel fo
r the Asserting Party incurred thereafter in connection with the Third Party Claim (except in the case of actual or potential differing interests, as provided in the preceding sentence), but shall not agree to any settlement of such Third Party Claim
which does not include an unconditional release of the Asserting Party by the third party claimant on account thereof.  If the Defending Party does not assume liability for and the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.2, the
Asserting Party shall have the right to assume the defense of and, if such Asserting Party shall have notified the Defending Party of the Asserting Party's intention to negotiate a settlement of the Third Party Claim, which notice shall include the
material terms of any proposed settlement in reasonable detail, to settle the Third Party Claim (at the Defending Party's expense to the extent the matter is determined to be subject to indemnification hereunder) on terms not materially inconsistent with
those set forth in s
uch notice, unless the Defending Party shall have notified the Asserting Party in writing of the Defending Party's election to assume liability for and the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.2 within ten (10) days after receipt
of such notice of intention to settle, and the Defending Party promptly thereafter shall have taken appropriate action to implement such defense.  The Asserting Party shall not be entitled to settle any such Third Party Claim pursuant to the preceding
sentence unless such settlement includes an unconditional release by the third party claimant on account thereof.  The Asserting Party and the Defending Party shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate fully with respect to the defense of any Third
Party Claim covered by this Article IX.</P>
