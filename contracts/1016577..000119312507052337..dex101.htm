_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares (the " _Shares_
") of the common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_
") at a purchase price of $16.00 per Share (such price or such higher price
as may be paid in the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to each seller of
Shares in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Purchaser, the Companys Board of
Directors, and the Managing Member of Parent (both on its own behalf and as
the sole stockholder of Purchaser), have each approved and/or recommended, as

WHEREAS, capitalized terms not defined in the context in the Section in which

agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with its terms, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to),
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), as
promptly as reasonable and practicable but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, the Offer at the Offer Price.
The obligation of Purchaser to consummate the Offer and to accept for payment
and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only
to (i) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ ,
and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex
II_. The conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser reserve the right,
in their sole discretion, subject to applicable Law to waive any such
condition in _Annex I_. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be 5:00
pm (EST) on the 40th calendar day following commencement of the Offer (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser may (i) extend the Offer one or more times beyond the
initial scheduled expiration date or any subsequent scheduled expiration date,
but in no event beyond the 70th calendar day following the commencement of
the Offer without the Companys consent, if, at the scheduled expiration of
the Offer, any of the conditions to Purchasers obligation to accept for
payment and to pay for Shares tendered shall not be satisfied or, to the
extent permitted by this Agreement, waived, and (ii) extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 1.01(a)_ shall not be deemed
to impair, limit or otherwise restrict the right of any party to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of  _Section 8.01_ hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the end of the 40th calendar day
following commencement of the Offer or at the end of any subsequent scheduled
expiration date, all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied and/or
waived other than the Minimum Condition, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to), if requested by the Company, extend the expiration of the
Offer one or more times; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not be obligated
to extend the Offer beyond 5:00 pm (EST) on the 70th calendar day following
commencement of the Offer. Each extension of the Offer pursuant to this
_Section 1.01(a)_ shall not exceed the lesser of five (5) Business Days (or
such longer period as the Company and Purchaser may agree in writing in any
particular instance) or such fewer number of days that Purchaser and the
Company reasonably believe are necessary to cause the conditions of the Offer
set forth in _Annex I_ and  _Annex II_ hereto to be satisfied. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and the satisfaction or earlier waiver of all the
conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ and _Annex II_ hereto as of any
expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after it is permitted to do so
under applicable Law (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after such expiration date of the Offer). On or prior to the date that
Purchaser becomes obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary to
pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant to
the Offer. The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, be net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer.



 

2 (b) Subject to _Section 1.01(a)_, Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in
its sole discretion, to modify the terms and conditions of the Offer,
including, without limitation, to extend the Offer beyond any scheduled
expiration date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price or
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than by adding
consideration), (ii) seek to purchase less than all outstanding Shares, (iii)
impose material conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in
_Annex I_ or otherwise modify or amend any of the conditions to the Offer set
forth in _Annex I_ that are in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, or
(iv) waive the conditions set forth in  _Annex II_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall
accept for payment and purchase all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ and _Annex II_.
As soon as reasonably practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent
and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
with respect to the Offer that (i) will comply in all material respects with
the provisions of all applicable federal securities Laws (other than with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference into the Schedule TO or
other Offer Documents), (ii) will contain (including as an exhibit) or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and a form of the related
letter of transmittal, and (iii) may contain a summary advertisement (at
Parents sole discretion), which documents, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, are referred to collectively herein as the "
_Offer Documents_." Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to
be mailed to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
securities laws. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents shall be, or have become,
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule TO and any Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC
and mailed to the holders of Shares. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree
to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments, whether written or
oral, that Parent or Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff promptly after receipt of such comments, to consult
with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and
to provide the Company with copies of all such responses, whether written or
oral.

Section 1.02 _Company Action_.

(a) The Companys Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on
March 9, 2007 has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions  



 

3  contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; (ii) resolved,
subject to _Section 5.02_, to recommend that the stockholders of the Company
accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, (iii)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of the stockholders of the Company and that the consideration to be
paid for each Share in the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of
Shares; and (iv) took all other action (including all required amendments to
the By-Laws of the Company) necessary to render Sections 3-602 and 3-701
through 3-710 of the MGCL and other state takeover statutes inapplicable to
the transactions contemplated by the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Unless the recommendation
of the Companys Board of Directors is withdrawn in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendations of the Companys Board of Directors
described in this _Section 1.02_.

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the
filing by Purchaser of the Schedule TO with respect to the Offer but in any
event on the date of commencement of the Offer, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that (i) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities Laws, and
(ii) unless the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors is
withdrawn in accordance with _Section 6.03_, will include the
recommendations of the Companys Board of Directors referred to in clause (ii)
of _Section 1.02(a)_ and the opinion(s) of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated and Duff and Phelps, LLC (collectively, the " _Company
Financial Advisors_ ") referred to in _Section 4.18_. The Company agrees to
mail such Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Shares. Each of the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agrees promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that the Schedule 14D-9 shall be, or have become, false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and mailed to the Companys stockholders, in each case to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and mailed to holders of
Shares. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel
with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, to consult with
Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and to provide
Parent with copies of all such responses, whether written or oral.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly on Parents
request furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing labels, security position
listings, any available non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any
available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses of the
record holders of the Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and
shall furnish Purchaser with such additional available information (including,
but not limited to, updated lists of holders of Common Stock and their
addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other information and assistance as Parent or
its agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer
to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. The Company  



 

4  represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that it has been advised
that each of its directors and executive officers intends to tender pursuant
to the Offer all the Common Stock owned of record and beneficially by him or
her except to the extent such tender would violate applicable federal
securities laws. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for
such steps as are necessary to mail the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the
Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_ or if the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company all copies of
such information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in
the possession of their agents or representatives.

(d) Provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, Parent and Purchaser agree that in the event that the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
by an applicable Offer expiration date when taken together with all shares of
Common Stock then owned by Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates
(collectively, the " _Base Shares_ ") equal or exceed at least 80% of the
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
acceptance for payment and purchase of all Shares validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) purchase (the
" _Top-Up Purchase_ ") at a price per share equal to the Offer Price up to
that number of newly issued shares of the Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_
") equal to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to
the Base Shares shall constitute a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock to effect a short-form merger under Section 3-106 of the MGCL;
_provided_ , that the foregoing percentage may be reduced by the Company in
its sole discretion to the extent of available authorized shares. The Top-Up
Purchase must be consummated by Purchaser on the Business Day following the
applicable Offer expiration date contemporaneously with the acceptance for
payment and purchase of all Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer. The
parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is
accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all
Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. The Company shall promptly issue and deliver to the Purchaser the
Top-Up Shares, and the Parent or Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Company
the Offer Price for such Top-Up Shares either, at the election of Purchaser,
(i) in cash by wire transfer or cashiers check, (ii) by issuance by Purchaser
to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the
Company or (iii) by a combination of the foregoing. 

(e) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) include in the
Schedule TO disclosure that is reasonably designed to provide broad, non-
discretionary distribution to the public of all material nonpublic information
provided or made available to the Parent or the Purchaser.

(f) The Company shall take such action as may be required to cause the
election of those individuals set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule
1.02(f)_ to the Companys Board of Directors effective upon consummation of
the Offer.

Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such
Charter.

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company (the " _By-Laws_ "), as

Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and be converted into the right to
receive an amount equal to the Offer Price in cash payable to the
holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon
surrender of the certificate (or evidence of Shares in book entry form)
representing such Share, less any withholding taxes.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any Subsidiary
of the Company and each Share owned by Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and no payment or other consideration shall be made
with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock, $0.0l par value, of Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, $0.0l par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.07 _Dissenting Shares_. 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but only
to the extent required by the MGCL, Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by any stockholder who has
not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of his or her Shares pursuant to the MGCL
and complies with all the provisions of the MGCL concerning the right of
holders of Shares to demand appraisal of their Shares in connection with the
Merger (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall
become the right to receive such cash consideration as may be determined to be
due to such stockholder as provided in the MGCL. If, however, such stockholder
withdraws his or her demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise
loses his or her right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the MGCL, his or
her Shares shall be deemed to be  



 

7  converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
Shares.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of Shares received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle, offer to settle or
otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

Section 2.08 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent in the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the funds necessary to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.06(a)_. Parent shall deposit such
aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the
Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this paragraph. Any
net profits resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
investments shall be payable as directed by Parent.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates (or shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.06(a)_. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash, without interest,
into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to  _Section 2.06(a)_, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(c) If payment of cash in respect of canceled Shares is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such payment in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that
such tax either has been paid or is not payable. If a mutilated Certificate is
surrendered to the Paying Agent or if the holder of a Certificate submits an
affidavit to the Paying Agent stating that the Certificate has been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken, such holder shall, if required by Parent,
furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Parent to
protect Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent from any loss
that any of them may suffer.



 

8 (d) Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash, certificates and other
documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and
Certificates representing Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.06(b)_) shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only as general creditors
thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by such holder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or the Paying Agent.

(f) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall not be any
further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.06(a)_ and this _Section 2.08_.

Section 2.09  _Stock Plans_.

(a) Subject to _Sections 2.09(b)_ through _(h)_ inclusive and except as set
forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 2.09(a)_ , prior to the expiration of
the Offer, the Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any other
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other
actions necessary to provide for the termination or cancellation, as
applicable, effective as of the Effective Time and subject to the Purchaser
purchasing the requisite shares of Common Stock in the Offer, of all stock
options for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Options_
"), and stock option plans or any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital stock of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Stock Plans_ "). Subject to
_Sections 2.09(b)_ through _(h)_ inclusive and except as set forth on
_Company Disclosure Schedule 2.09(a)_ , immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each such Option (whether vested or unvested) shall no longer be
exercisable and shall be cancelled or terminated without any payment therefor.



 

9 (b) Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Companys Board of Directors (or
any other committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all
other actions necessary to provide for the automatic acceleration of vesting
and the conversion, effective at the Effective Time and subject to the
Purchaser purchasing the requisite shares of Common Stock in the Offer, of
any options to acquire shares of Common Stock with an exercise price that is
less than the Offer Price, both vested and unvested, and which are outstanding
at the time of the commencement of the Offer (" _In-the-Money Option(s)_ "),
into the right, in full settlement thereof, to receive a payment in cash by
the Company (subject to any applicable withholding taxes), through the Paying
Agent, equal to the product of (a) the total number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such In-the-Money Options and (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to
such In-the-Money Options (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the " _In-the-Money Option Cash Payment(s)_ "), without payment to the
Company of the exercise price under such In-the-Money Options. The Companys
obligations with respect to the payment of the In-the-Money Option Cash
Payments shall be conditioned on consummation of the Merger at the Effective
Time.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, following the Effective Time, make
available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent cash in amounts
necessary for the payment of the aggregate In-the-Money Option Cash Payments
under _Section 2.09(b)_ to which holders of such rights shall be entitled at
the Effective Time. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any net profits resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable as directed
by the Surviving Corporation.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
an In-the-Money Option a copy of an Option Cancellation Agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (" _Option
Cancellation Agreement_ "), together with a letter (which shall be in a form
and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably
specify) including instructions for effecting the surrender of the Option
Cancellation Agreements in exchange for the In-the-Money Option Cash Payments
pursuant to _Section 2.09(b)_, as applicable. No In-the-Money Option Cash
Payment will be made by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Company with respect
to an In-the-Money Option, to the holder thereof until receipt by the Company
or the Paying Agent, as applicable, of an Option Cancellation Agreement with
respect to the related In-the-Money Option, properly completed and signed by
the record holder of such In-the-Money Option. The Company (prior to the
Effective Time), and the Surviving Corporation (after the Effective Time),
shall be required to deliver to the Paying Agent all such executed Option
Cancellation Agreements promptly after receipt. Upon proper delivery of an
Option Cancellation Agreement to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Option Cancellation Agreement shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of the In-the-Money Option Cash Payment pursuant
to _Section 2.09(b)_, without interest.

(e) If any payment pursuant to this _Section 2.09_ is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name an In-the-Money Option is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that the Option Cancellation Agreement
so delivered shall be properly endorsed  



 

10  or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required
by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the In-the-Money Option or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent or the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not
payable.

(f) Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all
cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.09_, and the Paying Agents
duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of an In-the-Money Option
canceled pursuant to this _Section 2.09_ shall look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and
only as general creditors thereof, with respect to any In-the-Money Option
Cash Payment that may be payable upon due surrender of an Option Cancellation
Agreement, duly completed and executed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) The Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this _Section 2.09_ such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient of such payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(h) All In-the-Money Option Cash Payments shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the respective In-the-
Money Options.

Section 2.10 _Warrants and Convertible Securities_. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall take all such action as may be necessary so that
holders of Warrants and Convertible Securities referred to in _Section 4.01_
shall be lawfully and adequately provided for in accordance with the
provisions of the agreements relating to such Warrants and Convertible
Securities.

made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser do
not make any representation or warranty with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing documents based upon

full force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, of the other parties thereto. There
are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Purchaser under any
term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment

to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied

Section 6.03 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_ (and the payments, if any, required to be made in connection
with such termination have been made), the Company shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and its Affiliates officers, directors, employees,
consultants, representatives and other agents, including, but not limited to,
investment bankers, attorneys and accountants (collectively, the "
_Representatives_ "), not to, (i) knowingly encourage, solicit, initiate or
encourage the making of, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any way in
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any nonpublic
information to, any Person (other than Parent or Purchaser) in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify, or propose to

and/or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, (iv)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or (v) enter into any agreement, letter of intent or similar document
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
,  _however_ , that this _Section 6.03_ shall not prohibit the Company or
the Representatives from participating in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnishing or disclosing nonpublic information to, any Person in response to
an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted
to the Company by such Person after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the date any Shares are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer (and not
withdrawn) if (I) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the
Representatives shall have violated in any material respect the provisions of
this _Section 6.03_, (II) a majority of the members of the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after discussions with its outside
counsel and financial  



 

33  advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably constitute a
Superior Proposal, (III) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after discussions with its outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; (IV) prior to or simultaneously with participating in
discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic
information to, such Person, the Company shall give Parent written notice of
the Companys intention to participate in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, such Person (without
identifying such Person), and the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less restrictive than
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, (V) prior to or simultaneously
with furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic information to such Person, the
Company furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information
has not been previously delivered or made available by the Company to
Parent), and (VI) the Company provides Parent with written notice at least
three Business Days prior to any meeting of the Companys Board of Directors
at which the Companys Board of Directors will consider the approval of
any Superior Proposal and the key terms thereof. In addition, it is
understood and agreed that, for purposes of this _Section 6.03_, a factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto and contains a "stop-look-and-listen communication" shall not be
deemed a violation of this _Section 6.03_ or a basis for termination under 
_Section 8.01_.

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.03(a)_, the Company as promptly as practicable shall advise Parent of any
request for information or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal, discussions or negotiation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
the terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, discussion or negotiation (but not the identity of any potential
acquiror or party to the Acquisition Proposal or any information that might
reasonably enable the identification of such party). The Company shall
promptly make available to Parent any nonpublic information the Company
provided to any other Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that
was not previously provided to Parent (but not the identity of any potential
acquiror or party to the Acquisition Proposal).

(c) The Company, its Affiliates and the Representatives shall immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any other parties that
may be ongoing as of the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer (other than
solely with respect to the assets of the European Business or the equity
securities of Sunterra Europe or any European Subsidiary) from any Person (in
each case, whether or not in writing and whether or not delivered to the
stockholders of the Company generally) relating to (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of over 20% in fair market value of the consolidated
assets of the Company or of over 20% of any class of equity securities of the
Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, asset sale, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company, the consummation of which would result in
the stockholders of the Company owning less than 50% of the capital stock of
the combined or ongoing entity or the  



 

34  entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company. " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal which the
Companys Board of Directors in good faith determines (based on such matters
as it deems relevant, including the advice of the Company Financial Advisors
and outside counsel), would be reasonably likely to, if consummated, result in
a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise) and
which is reasonably likely to be consummated.

(e) Subject to the provisions of _Section 8.01_, nothing contained in this
_Section 6.03_ shall prohibit Purchaser from purchasing the Shares pursuant
to the Offer or consummating the Merger.

Section 6.04 _Access to Information_.

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and the
Confidentiality Agreement, during the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending on the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Company Subsidiaries to (A) maintain Parents and
Purchasers access to the Data Room, and (B) upon reasonable notice, afford
Parent and Purchaser, and their respective counsel, accountants, consultants,
financing sources, and other authorized representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the properties, books and records of the
Company and its Company Subsidiaries so that they may have the opportunity to
make such investigations as they shall desire of the affairs of the Company
and its Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investigation
shall not affect the representations and warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party,
jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the
Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending on the earlier of (i) the Purchase Date and (ii) the date on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers and employees to
furnish such information and respond to such inquiries as Parent or Purchaser
shall from time to time reasonably request regarding post-closing integration
and operational issues and issues arising under this Agreement.

Section 6.05 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, after it
becomes aware of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence, or non-occurrence would be likely to cause (i) any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time, (ii)
any condition set forth in _Annex I_ or _II_ to be unsatisfied at any time
from the date hereof to the  



 

35  Purchase Date, or (iii) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in
this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied; and (b) any failure by
the Company to comply in all material respects with any of its covenants or
agreements hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall not limit or otherwise affect (1) the
right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, or
(2) any other remedies available to Parent under _Article VIII_ of this
Agreement. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
the Company shall consult with Parent, and Parent shall (and shall cause
Purchaser to) consult with the Company, to the extent practicable, before
issuing, and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release, public filings (including with the SEC)
or other public statements with respect to the Offer or the Merger and shall
not issue, or permit their Affiliates to issue, any such press
release, public filings (including with the SEC) or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation.

Section 6.07 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings,
and to use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, (a) cooperating in responding to inquiries from, and
making presentations to, regulatory authorities and customers, (b) defending
against and responding to any action, suit, proceeding, or investigation,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered, by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed, (c) cooperating in the preparation and filing of
the Offer Documents, the Schedule TO and the Schedule 14D-9 and (d) promptly
making all regulatory filings and applications, and any amendments thereto as
are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.08 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or other similar
Law becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company
shall promptly take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to render
such Law inapplicable to all of the foregoing.

Section 6.09  _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Company hereby waives the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as and to the extent necessary to
permit the filing of required  



 

36  documents with the SEC and disclosure of any information required to be
disclosed under any Law, in each case, in connection with the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.10 _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Purchase Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior
to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a
Subsidiary of the Company or provided executive services to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on
or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director or officer of, or provided executive services to, the Company or such
Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such
Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A)
or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in (A) the Companys Charter and By-Laws and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (B)
the indemnification agreements previously made available to Parent and
Purchaser by posting in the Data Room, which shall survive the transactions
contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time, shall cause the charter and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers
and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in
the Companys Charter and By-laws, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the
Purchase Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this  _Section 6.10_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this _Section 6.10_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
_Section 6.10(a)_ shall provide any Indemnitee with any greater rights to
indemnification for any matter for which the Company is providing
indemnification as of the date of the consummation of the Offer.



 

37 (b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any
acts or omissions covered under this _Section 6.10_ (each, a " _Claim_ ")
with counsel selected by the Indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent (i) shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense and
(ii) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without Parents written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Absent any conflicts of interest identified by counsel, each of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall
cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail" insurance
policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger), of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to the directors and officers of the Company as the
Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit
of the current and former officers and directors of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time
with respect to directors and officers liability for claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate annual premium payable for
such "tail" insurance policies exceed 200% of the aggregate annual premium
paid by the Company for directors and officers insurance under the policies
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (such amount being the " _Maximum
Premium_ "). If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance described
in the first sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_ for an amount equal to or
less than the Maximum Premium, the Company shall be entitled to obtain as
much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an amount equal to the
Maximum Premium.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this _Section 6.10_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.10_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_).

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this _Section 6.10_.



 

38 Section 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 6.12 _Deregistration of Shares_. Parent shall cause the Companys
securities to be de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

Section 6.13 _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter and Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to Parent and Purchaser to obtaining the Financing set forth therein, and
(iii) consummate the Financing at or prior to the dates that Purchaser becomes
obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer. If
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing on substantially similar terms from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach or alleged
material breach by any party to the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter of which Parent or Purchaser becomes aware, or any
termination or threatened termination of the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter without first consulting with
the Company or, if such amendment would, or would be reasonably expected to,
materially and adversely affect or delay in any material respect the ability
of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not conditioned upon the receipt by Parent or
Purchaser of the proceeds contemplated by the Financing and that any failure
by Parent or Purchaser to have available all funds necessary to pay for all
the Shares pursuant to the Offer at the date that Purchaser becomes obligated
to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer shall
constitute a willful breach by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall assist and cooperate in connection with the syndication
of the Financing as reasonably requested by Purchaser or Credit Suisse,
including, without limitation, making senior management available to
participate in the preparation of customary marketing materials, participation
in meetings with prospective lenders and meetings with rating agencies,
_provided_ that such assistance shall not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Company.



 

39 Section 6.14 _Employee Benefits_

(a) Parent shall, for a period of one (1) year immediately following the
Effective Date, cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to provide employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who continue
their employment with Parent or its affiliates (the " _Continuing Employees_
") with (x) at least substantially the same level of base salary or wage
rate and incentive bonus opportunity as in effect on the Effective Date and
(y) employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements (other than
stock options or other equity arrangement) that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and
arrangements provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
Continuing Employees prior to the Effective Date.

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting and, in the case of vacation and
severance only, benefit accrual under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser
or its affiliates providing benefits to Continuing Employees (the " _Purchaser
Plans_ "), Purchaser shall credit or cause to credit each Continuing Employee
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under any
similar Employee Plan. The Purchaser Plans shall not deny
Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions and
shall credit such Continuing Employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid in the year of initial participation in the Purchaser Plans.

ARTICLE VII

promulgated, enacted, entered or enforced, and no other action shall have been

restricting the consummation of the Merger.

be, fails to pay amounts due pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ (when and if
payable), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other
party for a fee set forth in this _Section 8.03_, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall pay to the other party its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
