AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 
 THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have previously been terminated in accordance with  _Section 7.1_, the Company has fulfilled its obligation to provide information to Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_ and the Company is prepared (in accordance with  _Section 1.2(b)_, to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on the same date as the Purchaser commences the Offer, the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, within 10 Business Days after the date of the initial public announcement of this Agreement, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment or pay for any shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn shall be subject solely to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly, voting power, represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis) and no less than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Company then outstanding (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis) and entitled to vote upon the adoption of this Agreement on the date Shares are accepted for payment (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser in their sole discretion, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. 

   

 (b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser in their sole discretion, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant 

      ##### 

  

    

to the Offer promptly after the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under
applicable Law (the date and time of acceptance for payment of such Shares,
the " _Acceptance Time"_ ). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
the Purchaser on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any
and all Shares that the Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and
purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall
be paid net to the holder of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section 2.2(e)_. 

   

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price, waive any condition to the Offer (except the Minimum Condition) or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend or modify any of the other conditions and requirements to the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (vi) impose additional conditions to the Offer or (vii) extend the Expiration Date other than in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 9:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on July 1, 2010 (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date on which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser shall be permitted and required to extend the Offer from time to time only as follows (and the Purchaser and Parent shall not extend the Offer for any other reason without the prior written consent of the Company) (i) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition or the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ) have not been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived by Parent or the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive periods of 10 Business Days each in order to permit the satisfaction of such condition or conditions or, to the extent permitted, the waiver of such condition or conditions, and (ii) the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. 

   

 (f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short Form Threshold (without regard to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option or Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the 

      ##### 

  

    

Offer, the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to,
immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period". The
Offer Documents shall provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering
period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section 1.1(f)_. 

   

 (g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Article 7_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_, the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to terminate the Offer promptly. If the Offer is terminated by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the registered holders thereof. 

   

 (h) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits: the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments required by the Exchange Act pursuant to which the Offer shall be made (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company that may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(h)_. Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act, the SEC or its staff or The New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to correct promptly any information provided by such party for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. No representation is made by Parent or the Purchaser with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Except in connection with a disclosure regarding a Change of Board Recommendation or an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, the Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, except in connection with a disclosure regarding a Change of Board Recommendation or an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such written responses and Parent and the Purchaser shall give 

      #####

Parent shall supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, all information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and affiliates as is required by such Section and Rule. 

   

 (c) After Parents designees are appointed or elected to, and constitute a majority of, the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least three directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided, however_ , that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate a person meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under this _Section 1.3(c)_. So long as there shall be at least one Continuing Director, any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement for the benefit of the Company, any change of date or postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting except as required by applicable Law, or any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement and any amendment of the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws shall require the concurrence of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or of the sole Continuing Director if there shall then be only one Continuing Director).

The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by such party for use in the Proxy Statement, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel.

 1.7 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 1.6_ , if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and, if applicable, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent and the Purchaser shall then hold of record, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding Shares (the " _Short Form Threshold_"), the parties hereto agree to take all reasonably necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  

 1.8 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the Acceptance Time and only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, constitutes one share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; _provided, however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) to the extent the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the Companys then authorized and unissued Shares (including as authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this  _Section 1.8_, any Shares held in the treasury of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and (ii) if immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, the Short Form Threshold would not be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares). Upon Parents request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the 

      ##### 

  

    

number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option and immediately after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser may pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares either
entirely in cash or, at the Purchasers election, by paying (x) in cash an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option
Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase
price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash (the "
_Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note shall be unsecured, full recourse,
non-negotiable and non-transferable, bear simple interest at 2% per annum,
shall provide that principal and interest is due one year after the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, and shall be prepayable in whole or in part
without premium or penalty. 

   

 (b) Provided that no applicable Law (other than the rules and regulations of the NYSE, which shall not apply for purposes of this _Section 1.8_) shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option in whole after the Top-Up Option has become exercisable and prior to the Effective Time. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") at least one Business Day in advance of such exercise specifying (i) the number of Shares held by Parent and Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and (iii) the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, including, at the Purchasers option, by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at the Purchasers request or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by applicable Law. 

   

 (d) Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares which the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and the Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, and shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Option Shares, an " _accredited investor_ ", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with 

     ##### 

  

    

a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 

   

 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ and subject, in the case of shares of Company Restricted Stock, to _Section 2.4(b)_ , upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, surrender of such Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company Subsidiary that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Company, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) _The Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall designate a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds as are necessary to ensure that the Paying Agent has funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Such funds shall be invested or otherwise held by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Purchaser, in their sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Purchaser, and no part of any such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or an "agents message in the case of a book entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time following the 12 month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to 

      ##### 

  

    

the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ , without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. If, immediately prior to such time on
which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has
not complied with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of
the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled,
the payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options, Company SARs or shares of Company Restricted Stock, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law, including with respect to any stock transfer Taxes payable by the seller. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options, Company SARs or shares of Company Restricted Stock, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof;  _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect 

   ##### 

  

 

or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
earlier of the Director Appointment Date or the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
(unless required by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 2.4 _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_. No later than immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall have taken all requisite action such that: 

  

 (a) _Treatment of Company Options and Company SARs_. Each Company Option and each Company SAR that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Acceptance Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be, by virtue of the occurrence of the Acceptance Time and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the holder of such Company Option or Company SAR or any other Person, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, within 30 days following the Acceptance Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company SAR, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per share exercise price under such Company Option or Company SAR. If the per share exercise price under any such Company Option or Company SAR is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, such Company Option or Company SAR shall be canceled pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_ without payment of consideration. 

   

 (b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards_. The payout of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the Acceptance Time remained subject to the Companys outstanding right to claim the return of such share under the terms of a Company Restricted Stock Award (each, a share of " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall remain subject to the vesting terms that applied with respect to such share of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Acceptance Time under the Company Restricted Stock Award applicable to such share of Company Restricted Stock. The Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in exchange for each share of Company Restricted Stock (" _Unvested Cash_ ") shall not be payable by the Purchaser at the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time (other than as specifically provided by the terms of a Contract (other than the Company Stock Option Plan applicable to each such award) to the contrary between the holder of such share of Company Restricted Stock and the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is in effect on the date of this Agreement) and shall instead be paid by the Purchaser in a cash lump-sum on the date upon which such share of Company Restricted Stock would have vested under the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Restricted Stock Award applicable to such share of 

      ##### 

  

    

Company Restricted Stock (and provided that if such terms and conditions are
not satisfied and vesting ceases to continue at any point after the Effective
Time, no cash payment shall be made with respect to such share of Company
Restricted Stock). All amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section 2.4(b)_
shall be paid without interest. Following the Effective Time, no
Unvested Cash, or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned
or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person,
other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process
in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of such Person, prior to the
payment to such Person of such Unvested Cash in accordance with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, each share
of Company Restricted Stock held by a non-employee director of the Company
that is outstanding as of the Acceptance Time shall not be assumed or
substituted for by the Purchaser and shall instead be cancelled in exchange
for a payment by the Purchaser in respect of each share of Company Restricted
Stock in an amount equal to the Offer Price, to be paid in a cash lump-sum as
soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time. 

   

 (c) _Termination of Company Stock Option Plans_. After the Acceptance Time, all Company Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, Company SARs, Company Restricted Stock Awards or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. 

   

 2.5 _Waivers; Board or Committee Resolutions_  

  

 (a) To the extent necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated in _Section 2.4_ , the Company shall, prior to the Acceptance Time, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) provide notice, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to all holders of outstanding Company Options, Company SARs and shares of Company Restricted Stock that are subject to _Section 2.4_ and (ii) obtain all necessary waivers, consents or releases from the Companys executive leadership team with respect to their shares of Company Restricted Stock. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board or any committee thereof that administers the Company Stock Option Plans shall adopt resolutions, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, approving the transactions contemplated in _Section 2.4_ as valid under the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued thereunder and further documenting that: (i) the transactions contemplated in _Section 2.4_ are consistent with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued thereunder, (ii) Parents assumption of the obligation to pay the Merger Consideration with respect to any Unvested Cash that vests pursuant to the terms set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ will result in Parent substituting an equivalent award for each share of Company Restricted Stock that becomes subject to the terms set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_, and (iii) neither consummation of the Offer nor the consummation of the Merger shall accelerate the vesting of any shares of Company Restricted Stock that are exchanged for Unvested Cash, except as specifically provided by (A) _Section 2.4(b)_ with respect to any such shares held by non-employee directors of the Company or (B) the terms of a Contract (other than the Company Stock Option Plan applicable to each such award) to the contrary between the holder of any such shares and the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 2.6 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, promptly after the date hereof, take all actions that are necessary to give effect to this _Section 2.6_ such that no options remain outstanding under the ESPP as of the Effective Time, including terminating the pending offering in progress promptly after the date hereof and returning all funds contributed to the ESPP that have not been used to purchase Company Common Stock to the participants as soon as administratively feasible. 

  

 2.7 _Amendment of Plans_. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Option Plan or the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required or reasonably requested by Parent to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

undertaking entered into by Company, Parent and Purchaser regarding
maintenance of privacy of such data in a form reasonably necessary to effect
compliance with such legislation. No investigation conducted pursuant to
this  _Section 5.3(a)_ shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify or limit
any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

The Company shall (I) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons, conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement, by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and (II) promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement (if requested by Parent), use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to such Person. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may (i) 

      ##### 

  

    

engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or waive any

writing that the Company Board determines in good faith After Consultation
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (ii)
furnish to the Person that has made the Acquisition Proposal described in
clause (i) above information relating to the Company pursuant to an

the Company received such Acquisition Proposal other than as a result of a
breach or violation of the terms of this _Section 5.4_, (B) prior

waiving any provision of, or granting permission under any standstill,

Subsidiary is a party with respect to, or furnishing any information to, such
Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person
and all of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and
of the Companys intention to engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or waive any provision of, or grant permission under any
standstill, confidentiality or similar Contract with, or furnish non-public
information to, such Person, and (C) contemporaneously with or prior to
furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes
such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by the Company to Parent). 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section 5.4(b)_ hereof, the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within 24 hours after the Company attaining knowledge of its receipt, notify Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event at Parents request and otherwise no later than 24 hours) of any change in, the status of discussions regarding or material terms and conditions of (including all amendments), any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be provided to the Company Board) of a meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, that prohibits the Company from providing the information described in _Sections 5.4(b) and 5.4(c)_ to Parent. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if it determines in good faith, After Consultation, that taking such actions are required to comply with and properly discharge the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and simultaneously enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; 

      ##### 

  

    

 _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
Breakup Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of _Section
7.1(e)_ and _Section 7.2_; and _provided further_ that the Company Board may
not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless: 

   

 (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation) or terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as defined below) with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided the execution draft of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and 

  

 (ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent shall not have, during the Notice Period, made an offer that would, upon the Companys acceptance, be binding on Parent and that, after consideration of such offer by the Company Board in good faith and After Consultation, results in the Company Board concluding that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

 

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver
a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.4(d)_ with respect to such new written notice (including a new
Notice Period). 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that that taking such actions are required to comply with and properly discharge the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time in response to an Intervening Event effect a Change of Board Recommendation; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board may not effect such a Change of Board Recommendation unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation, which notice shall specify the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation, and prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate 

      ##### 

  

    

with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer
necessary; _provided, further_ , Parent shall not have, during the Notice
Period, made an offer to amend this Agreement that would, upon the Companys
acceptance, be binding on Parent and that after due consideration of such
offer in good faith and After Consultation, results in the Company Board
concluding that failure to effect such Change of Board Recommendation would
not result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company; and _provided, further_ , that the Company Board shall not
be permitted to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this
_Section 5.4(e)_ with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by and solely subject in all respects to
_Section 5.4(d)_). 

   

 (f) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Representative that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4_ shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.4_ ) by the Company. 

   

 (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company Board from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation (including for purposes of _Section 7.1(e)_). 

   

 5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. 

  

 (a) The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in all cases up to and including the Outside Date, obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with the Antitrust Laws), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions and respond as promptly as practicable to any requests for additional information or documentary material with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the Antitrust Laws and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings.

In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this _Section 5.5(b)_, such party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the consummation of the Offer or the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section 5.5_, the Company shall give written notice to Parent of any of the following within 24 hours of the Companys knowledge of, and in any event within two Business Days after, the Companys receipt of notice thereof: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) any suit, action, claim or proceeding commenced or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary which, if pending on the date of this Agreement would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent practicable and permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party (or its counsel) the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to this Agreement will provide each other (or their counsel) with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement 

      #####

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of Parent or the Company, respectively, to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 5.6_ shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party or its parent company or Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. 

 

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions within and outside the United States of America by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process anywhere in the world in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE

    ##### 

  

     

IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND

THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_. 

   

 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or portable document format (PDF) and in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. It is accordingly agreed that prior to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_, (a) each party shall be entitled at its election to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and the Purchaser to cause the Offer and the Merger to be consummated and (b) the parties shall waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. A partys pursuit of specific performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct. 

  

 8.15 _Guaranty_. 

 

 (a) To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, SAP AG, an Aktiengesellschaft organized under the laws of Germany ("Guarantor"), intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due and punctual payment and performance of (i) Parents and the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement, including with respect to the Offer, and all fees and expenses associated therewith and (ii) Parents and the Purchasers liability and obligations (including for breach) under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). This guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor and its successors and assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied in full. Guarantor further covenants and agrees that, unless waived by the Company, it will, not later than five Business Days following the date hereof, appoint in accordance with applicable Law a registered agent for service of process in the State of Delaware, and Guarantor shall maintain such registered agent as its agent for service of process in the State of Delaware without interruption until the Effective Time.

  

 (b) All payments pursuant to this _Section 8.15_ shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. Guarantor promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of Guarantor of any kind.

    ##### 

  

    

 (c) The guarantee set forth in _Section 8.15(a)_ (the " _Guarantee_ ") is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full and punctual payment and performance by Parent and the Purchaser of the Guaranteed Obligations and not of collection. Should Parent or the Purchaser default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantors obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to the Company. Claims hereunder may be made on one or more occasions. If any payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

  

 (d) Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or the Purchaser; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms hereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release of any Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or the Purchaser; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent or the Purchaser; (vi) the adequacy of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Parent or the Purchaser may have at any time against the Company (other than rights of the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement), whether in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or the Purchaser or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than, in each case, fraud, willful misconduct and intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any of its affiliates), defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement and defenses available to Guarantor under the Guarantee. Guarantor acknowledges that it has received and will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this _Section 8.15_ are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

  

 (e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this _Section 8.15_ shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this  _Section 8.15_ preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this _Section 8.15_. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Company pursuant to this _Section 8.15_ or allowed it by Law or agreement with respect to this  _Section 8.15_ shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or

    ##### 

  

     

in any manner against, exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against
Parent, the Purchaser or any other Person liable for any Guaranteed
Obligations prior to proceeding against Guarantor hereunder or resort to any
security or other means of collecting payment. This Guarantee may only be
amended by a writing signed and delivered by Guarantor and the Company. 

  

 (f) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants and covenants that: (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of Guarantors organizational documents or any Law or contractual restriction binding on Guarantor or its assets; (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), (iii) nothing in this Agreement will terminate its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) Guarantor will not issue any press release or other communication in contravention of _Section 5.7_.

  

 (g) Nothing in this _Section 8.15_ shall waive any defenses, counterclaims or rights of setoff that Parent or the Purchaser may have under this Agreement or applicable Law.

       ##### 

  

    

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, the Purchaser, the Company and Guarantor have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
