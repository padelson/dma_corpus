whereby each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(b)</U> and other than Dissenting Shares)
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable net to the
holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;

any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this

prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or

Purchaser&#146;s liability and obligations (including for breach) under this Agreement (collectively,
the &#147;<U>Guaranteed Obligations</U>&#148;). This guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall
remain in full force and effect without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor and its
successors and assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied in full. Guarantor
further covenants and agrees that, unless waived by the Company, it will, not later than five

absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full and punctual payment and performance
by Parent and the Purchaser of the Guaranteed Obligations and not of collection. Should Parent or
the Purchaser default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to the Company. Claims
hereunder may be made on one or more occasions. If any payment in respect of any Guaranteed
Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall

assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or the Purchaser; (ii)
any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms hereof or any agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii)&nbsp;the
addition, substitution or release of any Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iv)&nbsp;any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or the
Purchaser; (v)&nbsp;any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting
Parent or the Purchaser; (vi)&nbsp;the adequacy of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment
related to the Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii)&nbsp;the existence of any claim, set-off or other right
which Parent or the Purchaser may have at any time against the Company (other than rights of the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement), whether in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or
otherwise. Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of the Guarantee and
of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default,
dishonor and protest, notice of the Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any
kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other
similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or
the Purchaser or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any of its affiliates), defenses to the payment of
