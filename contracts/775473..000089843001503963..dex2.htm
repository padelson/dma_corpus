accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Holdback Amount will be retained by GBB as security for the performance of the indemnity obligations of the ABD Shareholders under Section 8.2 of this Agreement, subject to reduction for any
unresolved indemnification claims of GBB pursuant to Section 8.2. Each ABD Shareholder who votes in favor of the Merger pursuant to the terms hereof by such vote, without any further action, and each ABD Shareholder who receives cash and GBB
Preferred Stock in connection with Merger, by acceptance thereof and without any further action, hereby confirms and agrees to the grant to GBB of the security interest in the Holdback Amount and grants to GBB a continuing limited power of attorney,
coupled with an interest to deal with the Holdback Amount as provided in this Section 8.2(b)(viii), and such power of attorney is not revocable until the final determination and settlement of any Contested Amounts pursuant to Section 8.2 of this

Amount allocable between the cash and securities included in the Holdback Amount as GBB determines in its sole discretion. If after all Contested Amounts are resolved as provided in Section 8.2 and any portion of the Holdback Amount remains, GBB
