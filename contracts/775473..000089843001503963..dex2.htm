 (b) GBB shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail, promptly after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of ABD Common Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive cash and shares of GBB Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as GBB shall specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing cash and shares of GBB Preferred Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by GBB, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) cash and a certificate representing that number of whole shares of GBB Preferred Stock into which the shares of ABD Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) hereof and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event a certificate is surrendered representing ABD Common Stock, the transfer of ownership of which is not registered in the transfer records of ABD, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of GBB Preferred Stock and cash to which the holder is entitled may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such ABD Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of GBB Preferred Stock and cash as contemplated by this Section 2.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if any holder of shares of ABD should be unable to surrender the Certificates for such cash and shares, because they have been lost or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof a bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to GBB and shall be entitled to receive the cash and certificate representing the proper number of shares of GBB Preferred Stock into which the shares of ABD Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) hereof and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof. GBB and ABD shall cooperate in establishing procedures for expediting the exchange of the Certificates for the cash and certificates representing shares of GBB Preferred Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.8. 



 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to GBB Preferred Stock which are declared payable to shareholders of record of GBB Preferred Stock after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of GBB Preferred Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of GBB Preferred Stock issued in exchange thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of GBB Preferred Stock to which  

   such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of GBB Preferred Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of GBB Preferred Stock.



 (d) All cash and shares of GBB Preferred Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of ABD Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.5) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of ABD Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of ABD Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to GBB for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 



 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the shareholders of ABD following the passage of six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to GBB, upon demand, and any shareholders of ABD who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.7 shall thereafter look only to GBB for payment of their claim for cash and GBB Preferred Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of GBB Preferred Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to GBB Preferred Stock. 



 (f) Neither GBB nor ABD shall be liable to any holder of shares of ABD Common Stock for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 



 (g) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of GBB Preferred Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of GBB Preferred Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. 



 2.9 _Treatment of Rights; Loans_. Prior to the Effective Time, ABD shall have taken all actions, including entering into appropriate agreements with holders of Rights, necessary to cause all Rights, including options, to acquire ABD Common Stock that have not been exercised by the Effective Time to expire and be cancelled as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, all holders desiring to exercise options to purchase ABD Common Stock shall be eligible to apply for a loan from a banking subsidiary of GBB at interest rates and other terms determined by such banking subsidiary in its discretion, subject to such holders meeting the underwriting criteria contained in GBBs credit policy. All loans of ABD employees made and funded by ABD prior to the Effective Time will be repaid by the holder thereof who shall be eligible to apply for a loan from a banking subsidiary of GBB prior to the Effective Time, the interest rate and other terms of the loans from such banking subsidiary to be determined by GBB in its discretion, subject to such employees meeting the underwriting criteria contained in GBBs credit policy.

or both, would constitute such default or breach, where such default or
breach would have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of
ABD on a consolidated basis. To ABDs knowledge, no party with whom ABD has
an agreement that is of material importance to the business of ABD is in
default thereunder. In addition, without limiting the generality of the

insurance carriers with whom it does business are in full force and effect,
there are no disputes pending between ABD and such insurers with respect to
any matter covered by such agreements, including the payment of commissions

Merger. ABD has full authority from insurance carriers to retain interest
earned on premiums held in trust by ABD.

All of the insurance contracts are valid and in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligations of ABD and, to the best of ABDs knowledge constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligations of the other parties thereto, and there are no existing defaults by ABD, by any other party thereunder and, no event, act, or omission has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time, or other happening or occurrence of any other event) would result in a default thereunder.

Except as Previously Disclosed, no customer or insurance companies has indicated any intention to terminate its relationship with ABD. All existing insurance policies sold by or through ABD were written pursuant to written insurance contracts which were in full force and effect at the inception of such policies. All policies and contracts of insurance which give rise to the expirations were sold pursuant to written insurance contracts which authorized ABD to write such business. 



 3.14 _Employees_. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no controversies pending or threatened between ABD and any of its employees that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of ABD on a consolidated basis. ABD is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to any of its employees or any labor organization to which its employees or any of them belong. Except as Previously Disclosed, ABD has complied in all material respects with all laws, rules or regulations promulgated by any Governmental Entity relating to employees, including, without limitation, wage and hour laws and discrimination laws. 



 3.15 _Brokers and Finders_.

ABD has all material licenses and permits that are necessary for the conduct of its business, and such licenses are in full force and effect, except for the lack of any license or permit or any failure to be in full force and effect that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of ABD on a consolidated basis. The properties, assets, operations and businesses of ABD are and have been maintained and conducted, in all material respects, in compliance with all applicable licenses and permits. The properties and operations of ABD are and have been maintained and conducted, in all material respects, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

ABD does not know of any basis for the assertion against it of any liability, obligation or claim (including, without limitation, that of any regulatory authority) that is likely to result in or cause a material adverse change in the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of ABD on a consolidated basis that is not fairly reflected in the Financial Statements of ABD or otherwise disclosed in this Agreement. 



 3.20 _Employee Benefit Plans_. 



 (a) ABD has previously made available to GBB copies of each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, of which ABD or any member of the same controlled group of corporations, trades or businesses as ABD within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA ("ERISA Affiliates") is a sponsor or participating employer or as to which ABD or any of its ERISA Affiliates makes contributions or is required to make contributions and which is subject to any provision of ERISA and covers any employee, whether active or retired, of ABD or any of its ERISA Affiliates, together with all amendments thereto, all currently effective and related summary plan descriptions, the determination letter from the IRS, the annual reports for the most recent three years (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and a summary of material modifications and all material employee communications prepared in connection with any such plan. Such plans are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employee Plans." ABD does not participate in an employee benefit pension plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified in form and operation under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the associated trust for each such Employee Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. To the best of ABDs knowledge, no event has occurred that will subject any Employee Plan to tax under Section 511 of the Code. All amendments required to bring each Employee Plan into conformity with all of the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws have been made. Except as Previously Disclosed, all Employee  

   Plans were in effect for substantially all of 2000 and 2001 to date, and
there has been no material amendment thereof (other than amendments required
to comply with applicable law) or material increase in the cost thereof or
benefits thereunder on or after January 1, 2001.



 (b) ABD has previously furnished to GBB copies or descriptions of each plan or arrangement maintained or otherwise contributed to by ABD or any of its ERISA Affiliates which is not an Employee Plan and which (exclusive of base salary and base wages) provides for any form of current or deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, stock award, stock-based compensation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-termination insurance, profit sharing, benefit, retirement, group health or insurance, disability, workers compensation, welfare or similar plan or arrangement for the benefit of any employee or class of employees, whether active or retired, of ABD or any of its ERISA Affiliates (such plans and arrangements being collectively referred to herein as "Benefit Arrangements"). Except as Previously Disclosed, all Benefit Arrangements which are in effect were in effect for substantially all of 2000 and 2001 to date. There has been no material amendment thereof or increase in the cost thereof or benefits payable thereunder since January 1, 2001. Except as Previously Disclosed, there has been no material increase in the compensation of or benefits payable to any senior executive employee of ABD since October 31, 2001, nor any employment, severance or similar contract entered into with any such employee, nor any amendment to any such contract, since October 31, 2001. 



 (c) With respect to all Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements, ABD and its ERISA Affiliates are in material compliance (other than noncompliance the cost or liability for which is not material) with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, governmental or court orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, applicable to such plans or arrangements. All government reports and filings required by law have been properly and timely filed in all material respects and all information required to be distributed to participants or beneficiaries has been distributed in all material respects with respect to each Employee Plan. ABD and its ERISA Affiliates have performed all of their obligations under all such Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements in all material aspects. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of ABD, threatened legal action, proceeding or investigation against or involving any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement. No condition exists that could constitute grounds for the termination of any Employee Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan, or any other employee benefit plan maintained by ABD or to the best of ABDs knowledge any of its ERISA Affiliates which is covered by Title I of ERISA, which could subject any person (other than a person for whom ABD is not directly or indirectly responsible) to liability under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of a tax under Section 4975 of the Code. No Employee Plan subject to Part III of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or both, has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived, nor has ABD failed to make any contribution or pay any amount due and owing as required by the terms of any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement. No "reportable event" as defined in ERISA has occurred with respect to any of the Employee Plans. Neither ABD nor to the best of ABDs knowledge any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred nor will incur, directly or indirectly, any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA which would constitute a liability of GBB or of any of its Affiliates (including ABD) at or after the Effective Time of the Merger. 



 (d) Neither ABD nor to the best of ABDs knowledge any of its ERISA Affiliates has provided or is required to provide security to any Employee Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. Each of the Employee Plans which is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and ABD does not know of any fact which would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan. All contributions required to be made to each of the Employee Plans under the terms of the Employee Plan, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws have been timely made. The Financial Statements of ABD properly reflect all amounts required to be accrued as liabilities to date under each of the Employee Plans. The fair market value of the assets of each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement that is funded, or required to be funded under the terms of the Employee Plan or  

   Benefit Arrangement, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law, equals or
exceeds the liabilities, including the present value of benefit obligations,
of such Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement.



 (e) Except for the Scheduled Contracts or as Previously Disclosed, as the case may be, each Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement and each personal services contract, fringe benefit, consulting contract or similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any officer, director, employee or other person can be terminated by ABD within a period of 30 days following the Effective Time of the Merger, without payment of any amount as a penalty, bonus, premium, severance pay or other compensation for such termination. 



 (f) All group health plans of ABD have been operated in compliance with the group health plan continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and with the group health plan portability, access and renewability requirements of Sections 9801 through 9833 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of ERISA, in all material respects. 



 (g) Except as Previously Disclosed, ABD has not used the services of (i) workers who have been provided by a third party contract labor supplier for more than six months or who may otherwise be eligible to participate in any of the Employee Plans or to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any of the Employee Plans or the imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to the IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity; (ii) temporary employees who have worked for more than six months or who may otherwise be eligible to participate in any of the Employee Plans or to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any of the Employee Plans or the imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to the IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity; (iii) individuals who have provided services to ABD as independent contractors for more than six months or who may otherwise be eligible to participate in the Employee Plans or to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any of the Employee Plans or the imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to the IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity or (iv) leased employees, as that term is defined in section 414(n) of the Code. 

 



 (h) Except as Previously Disclosed, with respect to each Employee Plan that is funded wholly or partially through an insurance policy, there will be no liability of ABD, as of the Closing Date, under any such insurance policy or ancillary agreement with respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior to the Closing Date.

 3.22 _Accounting Records_. ABD maintains accounting records which fairly and accurately reflect, in all material respects, its transactions and accounting controls exist sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that such transactions are, in all material respects, (i) executed in accordance with its managements general or specific authorization, and (ii) recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Such records, to the extent they contain important information pertaining to ABD which is not easily and readily available elsewhere, have been duplicated, and such duplicates are stored safely and securely. 



 3.23 _Offices_. ABD has Previously Disclosed to GBB the headquarters location of ABD and the locations of each of the other offices maintained and operated by ABD. Except as Previously Disclosed, ABD does not maintain any other office or conduct business at any other location, and ABD has not applied for or received permission to open any additional offices or operate at any other location. 



 3.24 _Power of Attorney_. ABD has not granted any Person a power of attorney or similar authorization that is presently in effect or outstanding. 

  3.25 _Facts Affecting Regulatory Approvals_. To the best knowledge of ABD, there is no fact, event or condition applicable to ABD which will, or reasonably would be expected to, adversely affect the likelihood of securing the requisite approvals or consents of any Governmental Entity to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



 3.26 _Tax Matters_. ABD has not through the date hereof taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under the Code. 



 3.27 _ Indemnification_.

 3.28 _Disclosure Documents and Applications_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of ABD ("ABD Supplied Information") for inclusion in (a) the proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of ABD; (b) the fairness hearing documents to be filed with the Commissioner of Corporations; and (c) any other documents to be filed with the FRB, the Commissioner of Insurance or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, will, at the respective times such documents are filed or become effective, or with respect to such proxy statement when mailed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 



 3.29 _Intellectual Property_. To the best of its knowledge, ABD owns or possesses valid and binding licenses and other rights to use without payment all material patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, service marks and trademarks used in its business; and ABD has not received any notice with respect thereto that asserts a violation of the rights of others. ABD has in all material respects performed all the obligations required to be performed by it and is not in default in any material respect under any license, contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing. 



 3.30 _Registration Obligation_. ABD is not under any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to register any of its securities under the Securities Act. 



 3.31 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no existing or pending transactions, nor are there any agreements or understandings, with any shareholders, directors, officers, or employees of ABD, or any person or entity Affiliated with any of them relating to, arising from or affecting ABD, including without limitation any transactions, arrangements or understandings relating to the purchase or sale of goods or services, the lending of monies or the sale, lease or use of any assets of ABD, with or without adequate compensation, in any amount whatsoever.

ABD shall have two Business Days thereafter to review such calculation. If ABD does not deliver to GBB a written notice of objection to such calculation specifying in reasonable detail its objections within such two Business Day period, such calculation of the Tangible Net Worth of ABD shall be final and binding on all parties. If after conducting such review, ABD advises GBB in writing no later than two Business Days after the delivery of PwCs calculation of the Tangible Net Worth of ABD that it disputes the calculation of the Tangible Net Worth of ABD prepared by PwC, then the dispute shall be resolved as follows: The parties shall first negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputed matters.

The parties shall be entitled to take discovery in accordance with the provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure, but either party may request that the arbitrator limit the amount or scope of discovery and, in determining whether to do so, the arbitrator shall balance the need for the discovery against the parties mutual desire to resolve disputes expeditiously and inexpensively. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorneys fees, expert fees, expenses and costs (whether or not such fees, expenses and costs are recoverable pursuant to the California Code of Civil Procedure).

     |

 (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of ABD given or made by ABD in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or agreement delivered by or on behalf of ABD pursuant hereto; 

---|--- 



     |

 (ii) any failure by ABD to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or agreement delivered by or on behalf of ABD pursuant hereto; and 

---|--- 



     |

 (iii) The conduct and operation of the business of ABD prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent any such Loss had been accrued as a liability on the balance sheet used to calculate the Tangible Net Worth of ABD as of December 31, 2001. 

---|--- 



 (b) In the event, from time to time, any GBB Indemnified Person or the ABD Shareholders Representative determines that any GBB Indemnified Person has suffered a Loss for which indemnification is available pursuant to this Article VIII, the following procedure shall be followed: 



     |

 (i) GBB Indemnified Person shall give written notice of any such claim (a "Loss Notice") to the ABD Shareholders Representative specifying in reasonable detail the amount of the claimed Loss (the "Loss Amount") and the basis for such Loss and that GBB intends to offset against the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for any Earn-Out Period (including the modification of the Aggregate Earn-Out Payments pursuant to Section 2(c)(v) relating to the Change in Control Payment and pursuant to Section 2(c)(vi) relating to the ABD Sale Payment) and Pro-Rata Amounts with respect thereto payable pursuant to Section 2(c) of this Agreement. 

---|--- 



     |

 (ii) Within ten (10) days after delivery of a Loss Notice, the ABD Shareholders Representative shall provide to GBB and the GBB Indemnified Person (if not the same Person), a written response (a "Response Notice") in which the ABD Shareholders Representative will (i) agree that an offset in the full Loss Amount may be made against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments, (ii) agree that an offset in an amount equal to part, but not all, of the Loss Amount (the "Agreed Amount") may be made against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments or (iii) contest making any offset against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments. The ABD Shareholders Representative may contest an offset against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments upon a good faith belief that all or such portion of such offset does not constitute a Loss for which the GBB  

---|--- 

   Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII.
If no Response Notice is delivered by the Shareholders Representative within
such ten (10) day period, the ABD Shareholders shall be deemed to have agreed
that an offset in the full Loss Amount may be made against such Aggregate
EarnOut Payments. 

---|--- 



     |

 (iii) If the ABD Shareholders Representative in the Response Notice agrees (or is deemed to have agreed), that an offset may be made against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments in an amount equal to the Loss Amount, such Aggregate EarnOut Payments shall be reduced in the following manner. With respect to each EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment), the cash to be included in the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for such EarnOut Period as determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) and (iii) (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment) shall be reduced by an amount equal to 60% of the Loss Amount and the stock to be included in the Aggregate EarnOut Payment for such Earn-Out Period as determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) and (iii) (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment) shall be reduced by a number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of GBB Preferred Stock or GBB common stock, whichever is applicable, equal to 40% of the Loss Amount divided by the fair market value of such security. The fair market value of the GBB Preferred Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 2.3(c)(iv) and the fair market value of the GBB common stock shall be determined as provided in Section 2.3(c)(v)(3). The Pro-Rata Amount of the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for such EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment) otherwise payable to each ABD Shareholder shall be proportionately reduced to reflect the amount of cash and securities deducted pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(iii). If the Loss Amount exceeds the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for any EarnOut Period, such excess Loss Amount shall be carried over to the next EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of the next Earn-Out Period) and the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for such subsequent EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of the next Earn-Out Period) shall be reduced in the same manner as provided in this Section 8.1(b)(iii). 

---|--- 



     |

 (iv) If the ABD Shareholders Representative in the Response Notice agrees that an offset in an Agreed Amount may be made against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments, the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for each EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of the next Earn-Out Period) shall be reduced in an amount equal to the Agreed Amount in the same manner as provided in Section 8.1(b)(iii). 

---|--- 



     |

 (v) If the ABD Shareholders Representative in the Response Notice contests an offset against such Aggregate EarnOut Payments equal to all or any part of the Loss Amount (the "Contested Amount"), the GBB Indemnified Person and the ABD Shareholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute. If any such dispute involving claims of less than $1,000,000 cannot be resolved within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by GBB of the Response Notice, the GBB Indemnified Person and the ABD Shareholders Representative shall submit the matter to the San Francisco office of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") for binding arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the AAA commercial arbitration rules in effect at the time such matter is submitted. If any such matter is submitted to the AAA as provided herein, (A) each of the GBB Indemnified Person and the ABD Shareholders Representative will furnish to AAA such workpapers and other documents and information as AAA may request and will be afforded the opportunity to present to AAA any material relevant to the matter, (B) the determination by AAA, as set forth in a notice delivered to the GBB Indemnified Person and the ABD Shareholders Representative by AAA, will be binding and conclusive on such parties. The Aggregate Earn-Out Payments for each EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of any Earn-Out Period) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount of the award set forth in such determination (as evidenced by such notice from AAA) in the same manner as provided in Section 8(b)(iii). 

---|--- 

       |

 (vi) In connection with any such commercial arbitration, the following rules also shall apply: (A) any party shall have the right to have counsel represent such party at the arbitration hearing and in pre-arbitration proceedings; (B) all parties shall be permitted to conduct discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (C) the arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to resolve any discovery disputes and to invoke an action to cease further discovery; (D) each party to any arbitration proceeding shall have the right to a written transcript made of the arbitration proceedings; (E) each party shall have the right to file post-arbitration briefs, which shall be considered by the arbitrator(s); and (F) each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and attorneys fees in connection with such arbitration except that the Surviving Corporation shall advance any costs of the ABD Shareholders. 

---|--- 



     |

 (vii) In the event of any disputes involving claims of $1,000,000 or more, any party shall have the right to bring such action in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. The Aggregate EarnOut Payments for each EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of any Earn-Out Period) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount of the non-appealable judgment of such a court of competent jurisdiction in the same manner as provided in Section 8(b)(iii). 

---|--- 



     |

 (viii) If at the end of the last EarnOut Period (or at the time of the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of any Earn-Out Period), there is any Contested Amount still unresolved, GBB shall withhold from the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for such EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if such payment is required to be made prior to the end of any Earn-Out Period) an amount equal to the lesser of the Contested Amount or the amount of such Aggregate EarnOut Payment (or Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment, if applicable) (the "Holdback Amount"). The Holdback Amount shall be comprised to the extent possible of cash to be included in such Aggregate EarnOut Payments (or Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment if applicable) in an amount equal to sixty percent (60%) of the Holdback Amount and of a number of shares of GBB Preferred Stock or GBB common stock, whichever is applicable, equal to 40% of the Holdback Amount divided by the fair market value of such security. If the Holdback Amount cannot be allocated in these proportions between cash and stock, it shall then be allocated as closely as possible to these percentages. The fair market value of such security shall be determined as provided in Section 8.2(b)(iii). The Pro Rata Amount of the Aggregate EarnOut Payments for such EarnOut Period (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment) otherwise payable to each ABD Shareholder shall be proportionally reduced to reflect the amount of the cash and securities required to be withheld pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(viii), and such Holdback Amount shall be distributed to the ABD Shareholders or GBB, as the case may be, only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Holdback Amount will be retained by GBB as security for the performance of the indemnity obligations of the ABD Shareholders under Section 8.2 of this Agreement, subject to reduction for any unresolved indemnification claims of GBB pursuant to Section 8.2. Each ABD Shareholder who votes in favor of the Merger pursuant to the terms hereof by such vote, without any further action, and each ABD Shareholder who receives cash and GBB Preferred Stock in connection with Merger, by acceptance thereof and without any further action, hereby confirms and agrees to the grant to GBB of the security interest in the Holdback Amount and grants to GBB a continuing limited power of attorney, coupled with an interest to deal with the Holdback Amount as provided in this Section 8.2(b)(viii), and such power of attorney is not revocable until the final determination and settlement of any Contested Amounts pursuant to Section 8.2 of this Agreement. To the extent it is determined that GBB is entitled to be indemnified with respect to any portion of the Contested Amount pursuant to Section 8.2, GBB shall have the right to deduct from the Holdback Amount such portion of the Contested Amount allocable between the cash and securities included in the Holdback Amount as GBB determines in its sole discretion. If after all Contested Amounts are resolved as provided in Section 8.2 and any portion of the Holdback Amount remains, GBB shall thereafter distribute such remaining Holdback Amount plus an amount equal to the interest that would be deemed earned on such remaining Holdback Amount distributed to the ABD Shareholders calculated at the rate of 5% per annum on such remaining Holdback Amount on the basis of 365 day year from the date the Holdback Amount is  

---|--- 

   withheld to the date of repayment of any such remaining Holdback Amount is
withheld to the date of repayment of any such remaining Holdback Amount to the
ABD Shareholders pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(vii) to the ABD Shareholders
prorata in accordance with the number of shares of issued and outstanding ABD
Common Stock held by such ABD Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time as reflected in the report provided by ABD to GBB and the Exchange Agent
at Closing. 

---|--- 



 (c) The indemnity obligations of the shareholders of ABD under this Article VIII shall be only satisfied through the exercise by GBB of the right of offset against the Aggregate EarnOut Payments (or the Change in Control Payment or ABD Sale Payment) otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 2.3(c). 



 (d) The exercise of such right of offset by GBB in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of offset will constitute an election of remedies or limit GBB in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies available to GBB. 



 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 to the contrary, the following limitations with respect to the indemnification obligations of the ABD Shareholders under Article VIII shall apply: 



     |

 (i) The ABD Shareholders shall not be liable for any amounts under this Section 8.2 unless and until the aggregate of Losses suffered by the GBB Indemnified Party(ies) from all claims for indemnification exceed $75,000, in which case the ABD Shareholders shall be liable for the full amount of Losses suffered by the GBB Indemnified Party(ies), including the first $75,000; and 

---|--- 



     |

 (ii) In no event shall the ABD Shareholders be liable to the GBB Indemnified Party(ies) for amounts under this Article VIII aggregating in excess of $50,000,000; provided, however, that the limitations set forth in this clause (ii) shall not apply with respect to any Loss which is the result of fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of ABD or the ABD Shareholders. 

---|--- 



 8.3 _Third Party Claims_. The obligations and liabilities of the ABD Shareholders with respect to their respective indemnities pursuant to this Article VIII, resulting from any third party claim ("Third Party Claim") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: 



 (a) The party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") must give the party obligated to indemnify (the "Indemnifying Party"), notice of any Third Party Claim which is asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by the Indemnified Party and which may give rise to liability of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII, stating (to the extent known or reasonably anticipated) the nature and basis of such Third Party Claim and the amount thereof; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent (i) that the Indemnifying Party shall have suffered actual damage by reason of such failure, or (ii) such failure or delay materially adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend, settle or compromise such Third Party Claim. 



 (b) Subject to Section 8.3(c) below, if the Indemnifying Party assumes responsibility for Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys risk and expense. 



 (c) In the event that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall elect not to undertake such defense, (ii) within a reasonable time after notice from the Indemnified Party of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall fail to undertake to defend such Third Party Claim, or (iii) there is a reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages or other money payments, then the Indemnified Party (upon further written notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of a Third Party Claim under this Section 8.3, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, in addition to the other sums required to be paid  

   hereunder, the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with such defense, compromise or settlement as and when
such costs and expenses are so incurred. 



 (d) Anything in this Section 8.3 to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall, without the other partys written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In all cases where such release is granted, if a firm written offer is made to settle any Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party proposes to accept such settlement and the Indemnified Party refuses to consent to such settlement then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall be excused from and the Indemnified Party shall be solely responsible for all further defense of such Third Party Claim; (B) the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party relating to such Third Party Claim shall be the amount of the proposed settlement if the amount thereafter recovered from the Indemnified Party on such Third Party Claim is greater than the amount of the proposed settlement; and (C) the Indemnified Party shall pay all attorneys fees and legal costs and expenses incurred after rejection of such settlement by the Indemnified Party, but if the amount thereafter recovered by such Third Party from the Indemnified Party is less than the amount of the proposed settlement, the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for such attorneys fees and legal costs and expenses up to the maximum amount equal to the difference between the amount recovered by such Third Party and the amount of the proposed settlement. 



 8.4 _No Recourse against ABD, GBB or the Surviving Corporation_. Each ABD Shareholder hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to recourse against ABD, GBB or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty or indemnity, or noncompliance with any conditions or covenants, given or made by ABD in this Agreement or any other agreements and documents executed or to be executed by the parties hereto in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No ABD Shareholder shall be entitled to, and each ABD Shareholder hereby irrevocably waives any right to, contribution from, subrogation to, indemnification from or recovery against ABD, GBB or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any liability of any ABD Shareholder that may arise under or pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other agreements and documents executed or to be executed by the parties hereto in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such other agreements and documents contemplated hereby, whether in such persons capacity as a shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of ABD. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall advance costs of defense of any Third Party Claim and the ABD Shareholders shall not be required to advance any funds for the defense of any such Third Party Claim. Each ABD Shareholder who votes in favor of the Merger pursuant to the terms hereof, by such vote, without any further action, and each ABD Shareholder who receives cash and shares of GBB Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger, by acceptance thereof and without any further action, agrees to the provisions of this Article VIII. 



 8.5 _ABD Shareholders  Representative_. Fred de Grosz shall, by virtue of the Merger, be appointed attorney-in-fact and authorized and empowered to act, for and on behalf of any or all of the ABD Shareholders (with full power of substitution in the premises), in connection with the indemnity provisions of Article VIII as they relate to ABD and the ABD Shareholders generally, and such other matters as are reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, (i) to review all claims for indemnification asserted by a GBB Indemnified Person, and, to the extent deemed appropriate, dispute, question the accuracy of, compromise, settle or otherwise resolve any and all such claims, (ii) to compromise on their behalf with GBB any claims asserted thereunder, (iii) to authorize payments to be made with respect to any such claims for indemnification, (iv) to execute and deliver on behalf of the ABD Shareholders any document or agreement contemplated by or necessary or desirable in connection with this Agreement, (v) to make such decisions or take such actions as may be necessary with respect to the determination of the EBITDA of ABD, the Hurdle EBITDA, Forecast EDITDA and Hurdle Amount, and (vi) to take such further actions including coordinating and administering post-closing matters related to the rights and obligations of the ABD Shareholders as are authorized in this Agreement (the above named representative, as well as any subsequent  

   representative of the ABD Shareholders appointed by the ABD Shareholders
being referred to herein as the "ABD Shareholders Representative"). The ABD
Shareholders Representative shall not be liable to any ABD Shareholder, GBB,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates or any other Person
with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the ABD
Shareholders Representative in his role as ABD Shareholders Representative
under or in connection with this Agreement unless such action or omission
results from or arises out of fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of the ABD Shareholders Representative. GBB and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely on such appointment and treat such ABD
Shareholders Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each
ABD Shareholder. Each ABD Shareholder who votes in favor of the Merger
pursuant to the terms hereof, by such vote, without any further action, and
each shareholder of ABD who receives cash and GBB Preferred Stock in
connection with the Merger, by acceptance thereof and without any further
action, confirms such appointment and authority. Should the named ABD
Shareholders Representative fail or cease to serve hereunder as such, the
Persons who held a majority of ABD Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect a successor ABD
Shareholders Representative.



 8.6 _Indemnification in Case of Strict Liability or Indemnitee Negligence_. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE VIII SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIABILITY IS BASED UPON PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE ACTS, CLAIMS OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION.

 The Hurdle EBITDA, Forecast EBITDA and Hurdle Amount for each EarnOut Period are subject to adjustment if ABD acquires any other insurance agencies during such Earn-Out Period as follows: 



 _For each agency acquired during the Earn Out Period with pro forma EBITDA of $5.0 million per annum or less, the "Basic Formula" outlined below will apply subject to the limit included in the "Basic Formula"._ If the acquired agency has pro forma EBITDA in excess of $5.0 million the management of GBB and the ABD Shareholders Representative will mutually agree on a formula specific to such an acquisition, or will agree on a cost of capital ("COC") appropriate for the acquisition to reflect the return on investment expectation of GBB shareholders and the risks of the project and the Hurdle EBITDA, Forecast EBITDA and Hurdle Amount for each Earn-Out Period will be adjusted accordingly. 



     |

 _The Basic Formula:_ 

---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

For each acquisition identified by ABD, the post acquisition EBITDA actually
generated by the acquisition will be included in ABDs EBITDA for the
applicable EarnOut Period. 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

Each acquisition will have a COC charge of 15% calculated based on the
purchase price. This level is reflective of GBBs current minimum level of
internal rate of return on such acquisitions. 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

For the purpose of the Base Earn-Out Payment for each Earn-Out Period, the COC
charge will not be added to Hurdle EBITDA for each Earn-Out Period.

  
---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

For purposes of the Incremental Earn-Out Payment and Excess Earn-Out Payment
for each Earn-Out Period the Hurdle EBITDA and Forecast EBITDA for each Earn-
Out Period will be increased by the amount of the COC charge. 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

The "Basic Formula" will apply only as long as the cumulative pro forma EBITDA
of all acquisitions effected under the Basic Formula does not exceed in any of
the four Earn-Out Periods, 25% of the Forecast EBITDA for such Earn-Out
Period. Once that threshold is reached, GBB and the ABD Shareholders
Representative will agree to a mutually acceptable amendment to the Basic
Formula or a new formula specific to the situation as applicable and the
Hurdle EBITDA, Forecast EBITDA and Hurdle Amount for each such Earn-Out Period
shall be modified accordingly. 

---|---|---|--- 



 The Basic Formula described above assumes the following five key elements: 



     |



 |



 |

Future acquisitions must be accretive to the combined entity and generate
return on equity in the 20-25% range consistent with GBBs historical return
on equity performance 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

No single acquisition may exceed $5.0 million of annual pro-forma acquired
EBITDA 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

A maximum acquisition EBITDA multiple of 6.0x is applied; the need to apply an
acquisition multiple in excess of 6.0x will require a mutual reassessment by
GBB and the ABD Shareholders Representative of the Basic Formula 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

A GBB COC of 15% 

---|---|---|--- 



     |



 |



 |

The Basic Formula only applies until December 31, 2005. 

---|---|---|--- 



 An illustrative example to highlight the parameters outlined above is attached to this Appendix A as Exhibit 1.
