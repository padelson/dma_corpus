NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter set forth
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

 

Article I 

DEFINITIONS; INTERPRETATION

 

1.1Defined Terms

 

. For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 

"Accounting Principles" shall mean the accounting methods, policies,
practices, principles, procedures (with consistent classifications), judgments
and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the
Company's audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 included
in the Annual Financial Statements, to the extent such accounting methods,
policies, practices, principles, procedures (with consistent classifications),
judgments and estimation methodologies were consistent with GAAP.

   

"Action" shall mean any claim, action, suit, arbitration, litigation, audit,
complaint, charge, mediation, prosecution or proceeding, in each case whether
civil or criminal, at law or in equity, commenced, brought, conducted by or
pending before any Governmental Entity, arbitrator, mediator or arbitration
tribunal.

 

"Additional Cash Payment Amount" shall mean an amount equal to (a)
$500,000,000 (five hundred million) minus (b) the product of (i) the number of
shares equal to 19.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of
Purchaser Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Closing multiplied by
(ii) the Average Purchaser Stock Price; provided, however, in the event that
the calculation of the Additional Cash Payment Amount would result in a
negative amount, the Additional Cash Payment Amount shall be deemed to be
$0.00 (zero dollars).

 

"Affiliate" shall mean, as to any Person, any other Person that, directly or
indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such
Person. As used in this definition, "control" (including, with its
correlative meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") means
the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests or by
contract; provided that, (i) from and after the Closing, (a) none of Holdco,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be considered an Affiliate of
Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates and (b) none of Seller or any of Seller's
Affiliates shall be considered an Affiliate of Holdco, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and (ii) in no event shall Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries be considered an Affiliate of any portfolio company (as such term
is commonly understood in the private equity industry) of, or investment fund
affiliated with, Siris Capital Group, LLC, nor shall any portfolio company (as
such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) (other than,
prior to the Closing, Holdco, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries) of, or
investment fund affiliated with, Siris Capital Group, LLC, be considered an
Affiliate of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. nor Plantronics, Inc. shall be deemed
to be an Affiliate of Seller or its Affiliates.

 

"Antitrust Laws" shall mean the HSR Act and any other antitrust, competition
or trade regulation Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 

"Average Purchaser Stock Price" shall mean the VWAP for the thirty (30)
consecutive Trading Days ending on (and including) the Trading Day that is
immediately preceding the Closing Date. 

 

"Business" shall mean the business of Holdco and its Subsidiaries.

 

"Business Day" shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other
day on which commercial banks in the City of New York, New York are required
or authorized by Law to be closed.

   

"Cash Amounts" shall mean, without duplication, the aggregate amount of all
Cash Equivalents of Holdco and each of its Subsidiaries, as of immediately
prior to the Closing, in each case, calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

 

"Cash Equivalents" shall mean, with respect to any Person, the cash, cash
equivalents (that are convertible into unrestricted cash within 30 days) and
marketable securities (net of issued but uncleared checks and drafts, but
including all received but uncleared checks, drafts and wires) of such Person,
in each case excluding all Restricted Cash, and in each case calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 

"Cash Purchase Price" shall mean $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars), minus
the Purchaser Representation and Warranty Policy Cost, plus the Net
Indebtedness Amount set forth on the Final Closing Statement, plus the amount
(if any) by which the Closing Net Working Capital Amount set forth on the
Final Closing Statement exceeds the Target Closing Net Working Capital Amount,
minus the amount (if any) by which the Target Closing Net Working Capital
Amount exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital Amount set forth on the Final
Closing Statement.

 

"Closing Cash Payment" shall mean $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars), minus
the Purchaser Representation and Warranty Cost Plus, plus the Estimated Net
Indebtedness Amount set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement, plus the
amount (if any) by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount set
forth on the Estimated Closing Statement exceeds the Target Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, minus the amount (if any) by which the Target Closing
Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
Amount set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement.

 

"Closing Net Working Capital Amount" shall mean, in each case, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, and without duplication, an amount (which
may be positive or negative) equal to the current assets (excluding (v) Cash
Equivalents, (w) Income Tax assets, (x) all deferred Tax assets, (y) deferred
financing assets and (z) the Synchronoss Amount) of Holdco and its
Subsidiaries, minus the current liabilities (excluding Income Tax liabilities,
all deferred Tax liabilities, Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses, and
Liabilities in respect of the Company LTIP) of Holdco and its Subsidiaries, in
each case, calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the payment obligations of Seller pursuant to
Section 5.17 (including the underlying Liabilities of Holdco) shall be taken
into account in the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount,
whether or not any such payment obligations would also constitute current
liabilities of Holdco and its Subsidiaries under the Accounting Principles (it
being the intention of the Parties to avoid duplication or double counting).
The Parties further agree that the purpose of preparing and calculating the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount is to measure the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount as of immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. 

 

"Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any rules
or regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

"Company Credit Agreements" shall mean the Company First Lien Credit Agreement

or otherwise have a right to use).

the business, assets and liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of Holdco, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided that no such event, change, fact, circumstance,
development or effect, to the extent resulting or arising from or in
connection with any of the following matters, shall be deemed, either alone or
in combination, to constitute or contribute to, or be taken into account in
determining, whether there has been or there would reasonably be expected to
be, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) general conditions and trends in
the industries or businesses in which any of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary operates, including competition in any of the geographic or product
areas in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary operates; (b) general

Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries to take), or Seller's failure to take (or
its failure to cause Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries to take) any action, in
each case, which is expressly required to be taken, or not taken, by this
Agreement, or any action taken, or failure to take any action, required by
applicable Law; (g) the failure of the financial or operating performance of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to meet any projections, forecasts or
budgets for any period (provided that the underlying causes thereof, to the
extent not otherwise excluded by this definition, may be taken into account in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred; provided,
further, that this clause (g) shall not be construed as implying that Seller
is making any representation or warranty hereunder with respect to any
projections, forecasts or budgets); (h) any action taken (or omitted to be
taken), or such other changes or events, in each case, which Purchaser has
requested or to which Purchaser has consented in

   

writing or the failure to take actions due to Purchaser's failure to consent
thereto following the request of Seller in writing which failure to consent

apply with respect to references to Company Material Adverse Effect in any

such representations or warranties expressly address consequences resulting
from the execution, announcement, pendency or consummation of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby); provided, further, that any event,
change, development or effect referred to in clauses (a) through (e) may be
deemed, either alone or in combination, to constitute or contribute to, or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably
be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect to the extent, and solely
to the extent, such event, change, development or effect has a
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate.

 

"Company Second Lien Credit Agreement" shall mean the Second Lien Credit

potential buyers or any contemplated public offering as an alternative
thereto) or the consummation of the Sale (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any expenses incurred in connection with the Debt Financing); (b) any
fees payable to Seller or its Affiliates (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, Holdco or its Subsidiaries) under the Management Agreement (provided

Accounting Firm in its proceedings, including by providing such accounting
books and records and working papers of each Party and its independent
auditors, as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request; provided

work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance
with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after such
Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an
arbitrator. The Independent Accounting Firm shall not review or make any
determination with respect to any matter other than the matters indicated in
the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute

   

that Seller and Purchaser shall have submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Independent Accounting
Firm's engagement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall deliver to Seller and
Purchaser a written report setting forth its final determination, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.6, of the
appropriate amount of each of the matters indicated in the Notice of
Disagreement that remain in dispute that Seller and Purchaser shall have
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. With respect to each disputed
matter, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either
Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, or less than the
lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement or by
Purchaser in the Initial Closing Statement with respect to such disputed
matter. Absent manifest errors, such report of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be conclusive, final and binding on the Parties and enforceable in
a court of law, effective as of the date the Independent Accounting Firm's
written determination is received by Seller and Purchaser. The statements of

the Parties pursuant to Section 2.6(a) or Section 2.6(b) or to reflect the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
2.6(c), are referred to as the "Final Closing Statement." All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.

and exclusive remedy of any of the Parties and their respective Affiliates for
any disputes related to the preparation of the Final Closing Statement, the
adjustments provided for in Section 2.5 and the calculations and amounts on
which they are based or set forth in the related statements and notices
delivered in connection therewith. After the determination of the Final
Closing Statement, none of the Parties shall have the right to make any claim
based upon the preparation of the Final Closing Statement or the calculation
of the Net Indebtedness Amount or Closing Net Working Capital Amount even if
subsequent events or subsequently discovered facts would have affected the
determination of the Final Closing Statement or the calculations of the Net
Indebtedness Amount or Closing Net Working Capital Amount had such subsequent
events or subsequently discovered facts been known at the time of the
determination of the Final Closing Statement.

instruction is delivered to the Escrow Agent (which number of shares shall be
specified in such joint written instruction) rounded up to the next whole

Purchaser all shares of Purchaser Common Stock held in the Working Capital
Escrow Account and (2) Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser an
amount in cash equal to the difference between (x) the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount and (y) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
delivered to Purchaser pursuant to clause (1) multiplied by the Post-Closing
Average Purchaser Stock Price as of the date of such joint written instruction
is delivered to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, to an account (or accounts) specified by Purchaser in writing;
provided, further, that, if Seller does not pay the amount owed to Purchaser
pursuant to clause (2) in the preceding proviso in full within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Final Closing Statement has become final and binding
on the Parties pursuant to Section 2.6(c), Purchaser and Seller shall, if

(in a customary form for a transaction of the type contemplated by this
Agreement that is reasonably agreeable to the Parties) with a nationally
recognized banking institution mutually agreeable to the Parties (the "Escrow
Agent", and such escrow agreement, the "Escrow Agreement"), pursuant to which
Purchaser will, at the Closing, (i) deliver the LTIP Escrow Shares to the
Escrow Agent to be deposited into an account designated by the Escrow Agent
solely for such shares (the "LTIP Escrow Account") and (ii) deliver the
Working Capital Escrow Shares to the Escrow Agent to be deposited into an
account designated by the Escrow Agent solely for such shares (the "Working
Capital Escrow Account"). The Escrow Agent shall retain (x) LTIP Escrow
Shares for the purposes of securing the Parties' obligations under Section
5.17 and the second proviso of Section 2.7(b)(i)(A) and (y) Working Capital
Escrow Shares for the purposes of securing the Parties' obligations under
Section 2.7. The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the distribution by the
Escrow Agent of the LTIP Escrow Shares and the Working Capital Escrow Shares
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Escrow Agreement).
Seller shall be entitled to receive directly from Purchaser all dividends or
other distributions (other than any extraordinary dividend or distribution) in
respect of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock in the LTIP Escrow Account or
the Working Capital Escrow Account, in each case, to the extent such shares of
Purchaser Common Stock are held by the Escrow Agent on the applicable record
date for such dividend or distribution (or if there is no such record date, on
the date of payment) (and the Escrow Agreement shall so provide). In the
event that Purchaser effects any extraordinary dividend or distribution in
respect of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock, then Purchaser shall, to the
extent that shares of Purchaser Common Stock are held by the Escrow Agent on
the applicable record date for such dividend or distribution (or if there is
no such record date, on the date of payment), deliver such extraordinary
dividend or distribution to the Escrow Agent to be deposited in the LTIP
Escrow Account and the Working Capital Escrow Account, as applicable (and, in
the event there are an insufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
in the LTIP Escrow Account or Working Capital Escrow Account to satisfy in
accordance herewith any amount owed to Purchaser to be satisfied out of the
LTIP Escrow Account or Working Capital Escrow Account, as applicable, and
therefore Purchaser would otherwise need to satisfy such shortfall with cash,
such extraordinary dividend or distribution shall be available to satisfy such
shortfall), and, upon the subsequent release (whether to Seller or Purchaser)
of any share of Purchaser Common Stock from the LTIP Escrow Account or the
Working Capital Escrow Account, as the case may be, and the satisfaction in
accordance herewith of any applicable amount owed to Purchaser, the Escrow
Agent shall release to Seller such extraordinary dividend or distribution paid
in respect of each such share of Purchaser Common Stock so released (and the
Escrow Agreement shall so provide).

 

(b)The Parties agree to treat the Purchaser as the owner of the Escrow Account
for all Tax purposes, and the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent with

of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default or give rise to the creation of any Lien (except Permitted Liens), or

case, under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract or
Permit to which Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets are bound or affected by, or (iii) violate any Law

of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on the Business (the "Permits"), except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits,

have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any
such Permit is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, and
there have occurred no defaults under, or events giving rise to a right of
termination, amendment or cancellation of any such Permit (with or without
notice, the lapse of time or both), except where the failure to have, or the

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or delay beyond the

Holdco, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which Holdco,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of Holdco, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any such non-compliance

reflected on the Company Balance Sheet, none of Holdco, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has any Liabilities of a nature required to be disclosed on
the face of a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP or that would be required to be
so disclosed but for the contingency or inestimability thereof, except for (i)
Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
Company Balance Sheet, (ii) Liabilities that have not had, and would not

change, development or effect that is continuing and would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

   

Company Material Adverse Effect and (c) to the date of this Agreement, none of

Effect. None of Holdco, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any property
or asset of Holdco, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any

of competent jurisdiction, in each case, that is adverse to Holdco, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination or award of any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction, in each case, that would, individually or in the aggregate,

on or prohibition against or limit the Company's ability to operate the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries substantially as it was
operated prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to the Company
Leased Real Property.

Registered Company Intellectual Property.

manner in which it was used prior to the Closing, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since January 1,

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

employee's right, title and interest in and to Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by the employees in the course
of their employment, and, with respect to consultants or contractors, all
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by
such consultants or contractors in the course of performing services for the

similar Contract relating to Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property
Rights entered into between such employee, officer, consultant or contractor
and the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with such individual's
employment or other engagement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
except where such default or breach would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No current or former employee, consultant or
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or claimed in writing
any ownership interest, in whole or in part, whether or not currently
exercisable, in any material Owned Company Intellectual Property. All
assignments of issued Patents included in the Registered Company Intellectual

Effect.

3.23Investment Intent

 

.

investment purposes only, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view
toward, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the federal securities Laws or any applicable foreign or state
securities Law.

 

(b)Seller represents that it qualifies as an "accredited investor," as such
term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.
Seller agrees that it has not and will not take any action that would have an
adverse effect on the availability of the exemption from registration provided
by Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to the
Equity Consideration.

 

(c)Seller understands that the acquisition of the Equity Consideration to be
acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement involves substantial
risk (including a complete loss of Seller's investment or a reduction in the
price of the Equity Consideration). Seller and its officers and managers have
experience as an investor in securities and equity interests of companies such
as the ones to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement, and Seller can
bear the economic risk of its investment and has such knowledge and experience
in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Equity Consideration to be acquired by it
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d)Seller understands that the Equity Consideration to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement has not been registered under the Securities Act.
Seller acknowledges that such securities may not be transferred, sold, offered
for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act and any other provision of applicable state
securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom.

 

(e)Seller understands that the Equity Consideration shall be delivered to
Seller in book-entry form and shall be subject to a customary restrictive
notation in the stock ledger or other appropriate records maintained by the
Company's transfer agent. Such restrictive notation shall be substantially
similar to the following legend appropriately adjusted to reflect their book-
entry form and consistent with the provisions of the Registration Rights
Agreement:

 

"The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or under any
other applicable securities laws. The

   

securities may not be sold, transferred, assigned or pledged or otherwise
disposed of at any time unless (i) they are registered under the Securities
Act and such other applicable laws, (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel for
SSandC Technologies Holdings, Inc. or other legal opinion reasonably
satisfactory to the transfer agent for such securities that such disposition
will not result in a violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws or (iii) sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
another available exemption therefrom."

Representatives of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any

reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing), whether or
not included in any management presentation or in any other information made
available to Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
or any other Person, and that any such representations or warranties are
expressly disclaimed.

 

3.26No Other Representations or Warranties

 

. Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Article
III, neither Seller nor any other Person on behalf of Seller has made or
makes, and Purchaser has not relied upon, any representation or warranty,
whether express or implied, with respect to Seller, Holdco, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any matter relating to any of them, including their
respective businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities, financial condition or
results of operations, or with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any
other information provided or made available to Purchaser or any of its
Representatives by or on behalf of Seller, and any such representations or
warranties are expressly disclaimed. None of Seller or any other Person on
behalf of Seller has made or makes any representation or warranty, whether
express or implied, with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates or
budgets made available to Purchaser or any of its Representatives of future
revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash

aggregate, reasonably be expected to cause a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.

 

4.8Brokers

4.9Sufficiency of Funds; Financing

 

.

 

(a)On the Closing Date and as of the Closing, Purchaser shall have all funds
necessary to consummate the Sale and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and pay the Purchase Price and all other cash amounts required to be
paid at or in connection with the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the repayment or redemption of any Indebtedness
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Purchaser or any of
the Purchaser's Subsidiaries that may be required to be repaid or redeemed in
connection with the foregoing) (such aggregate amount, collectively, the
"Required Amount"), and, when so required to pay or otherwise perform, as
applicable, Purchaser will be able to pay or otherwise perform the obligations
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries under this Agreement. Purchaser has
delivered evidence to the Company of its ability to satisfy the obligations
described in the preceding sentence.

 

(b)As of the date hereof, Purchaser and all the Financing Sources party
thereto have fully executed a debt commitment letter, dated the date hereof,
including all related term sheets and all exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto and the associated fee letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant
to which such Financing Sources have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to provide the amount of debt financing set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt Financing").

 

(c)Except for the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter (a true
and complete copy of which fee letter has been provided to the Company in the
form of the Redacted Fee Letter), a true and complete copy of the Debt
Commitment Letter has been provided to the Company by Purchaser. Purchaser has
fully paid, or has caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the
date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser
and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each other party thereto, including the
Financing Sources, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors' rights or by principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity). As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified, and no provision thereof has been waived, and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, no such amendment, modification or waiver is
contemplated or pending, and the commitments contained therein have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect, on or prior to the date
hereof, and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no such withdrawal, termination or
rescission is contemplated. No event has occurred

   

which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a
breach or default under the Debt Commitment Letter on the part of Purchaser
or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter, and there are no side letters or other agreements (other than the
Redacted Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof) that could adversely
affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Debt
Financing or the timing of the Closing. The Debt Financing is not subject to
any conditions to the obligations of the parties under the Debt Commitment
Letter to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Purchaser at
the Closing other than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(d)Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 are
satisfied at Closing, the aggregate net proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter when funded in accordance with the terms therein on the
Closing Date, together with cash on hand of the Purchaser, will be sufficient
for Purchaser to fund the Required Amount. As of the date hereof, assuming
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 are satisfied at
Closing, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will fail to be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full
amount of the Debt Financing will not be available to Purchaser on the Closing
Date. 

 

(e)In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a
condition to any of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement

 

4.10Solvency

 

. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Sale and any
financing being entered into by Purchaser in connection therewith) and the

toward, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in

securities Law.

   

(b)Purchaser represents that it qualifies as an "accredited investor," as such
term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

provided by Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to

be acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement involves substantial
risk (including a complete loss of Purchaser's investment or a reduction in
the price of the Membership Interests). Purchaser and its officers and
managers have experience as an investor in securities and equity interests of
companies such as the ones to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement,
and Purchaser can bear the economic risk of its investment and has such
knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Membership
Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(d)Purchaser understands that the Membership Interests to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement have not been registered under the Securities Act.

state securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom.

entering into this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that it has relied solely

Company, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability
to Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives or

submitted on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates or in any other form in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Sale. Purchaser further acknowledges that no Representative of Seller,

or implied, to make any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
not specifically set forth in this Agreement and subject to the limited
remedies herein provided. Purchaser acknowledges that, should the Closing

Securities Act) on Form S-3 under the Securities Act.

(including the Company's and any Company Subsidiary's) businesses or
operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Seller, directly

5.2Access to Information

 

.

 

(a)After the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and subject to the
requirements of applicable Laws and the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller
shall, and shall cause Holdco and its Subsidiaries to, afford to Purchaser and
its Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
reasonable access to the personnel, properties, offices, facilities, assets,
books and records of Holdco and each of its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish
Purchaser with such

   

financial, operating and other data and information as Purchaser, through its
officers, employees or other Representatives, may reasonably request; provided
that none of Seller or Holdco shall make available, or cause the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to make available, employee personnel files until after
the Closing Date. 

 

(b)The foregoing provisions of Section 5.2 shall not require Seller to afford
any access to any information that, in the reasonable judgment of Seller would
(i) contravene any applicable Law, (ii) be in connection with any litigation
or similar dispute between the Parties, (iii) cause a risk of loss or waiver
of the protection of any attorney‑client privilege, attorney work product or
other legal privilege, (iv) unreasonably disrupt the operations of Seller or
any of its Affiliates, (v) result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of

afforded by trade secret Laws) or (vi) result in the disclosure of any
information regarding the valuation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary;
provided that Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to identify and pursue a permissible method of providing such disclosure under
circumstances in which the restrictions of this sentence apply.

 

(c)From the date hereof until the Closing Date, to the extent not prohibited
by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity, (i) Seller shall promptly notify

Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.8 and (ii) Purchaser
shall promptly notify Seller of any Action or investigation commenced or, to

5.3Confidentiality

 

. The Parties expressly agree that, notwithstanding any provision of the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue
in full force and effect until the Closing; provided that Purchaser's
obligations thereunder shall terminate upon the Closing only in respect of
that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) exclusively relating to Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Parties expressly agree that, notwithstanding any provision of the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, including with respect to
termination thereof, if, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

5.4Required Actions

 

.

 

(a)Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate
the Sale, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations
and notices required to be filed to consummate the Sale, (ii) taking all
actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any
consent, clearance, expiration or termination of a waiting period,
authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all

   

information required under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws) required
to be obtained or made by Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the Sale, and (iii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Sale and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to fulfill all conditions
precedent to this Agreement. 

 

(b)Prior to the Closing, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
Purchaser and Seller shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Sale and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or
any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity. In that regard, prior to the
Closing, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.3, to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each Party shall promptly consult
with the other Party to this Agreement to provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Party
(or its counsel) copies of) all filings made by such Party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party to, or
substantive correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement and the Sale. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section
5.3, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each Party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the other Party to this Agreement, and in the
case of written communication, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other Party orally of) any
substantive communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Sale, and
permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written or
oral substantive communication or submission with or to any such Governmental
Entity. If any Party to this Agreement or any Representative of such Party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Sale, then such Party will make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Party to this
Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither
Party shall participate in any substantive meeting with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Sale, or with any other Person
in connection with any proceeding or Action by a private party relating to the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws in connection with this Agreement or the
Sale, or make substantive oral submissions at meetings or in telephone or
other conversations, unless it consults with the other Party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or other Person,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat;
provided that nothing herein shall prohibit either Party from engaging in non-
substantive or ministerial communications with any Governmental Entity.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.3, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, each Party shall furnish the other Party with
copies of all written correspondence, filings, submissions and substantive
communications between it and any such Governmental Entity or other such
Person with respect to this Agreement and the Sale, and furnish the other
Party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity or other
such Person. Purchaser, Seller, and the Company may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any information reasonably determined by
it to be competitively

   

sensitive material provided to the other Party under this Agreement as
"outside counsel/corporate in-house antitrust counsel only." Such designated
materials and any materials provided by Purchaser to Seller or the Company or
by Seller or the Company to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.4, and the
information contained therein, shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel of the recipient and shall
not be disclosed by such outside counsel and corporate in-house antitrust
counsel to employees (other than corporate in-house antitrust counsel),
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel; it being understood that materials provided
pursuant to this Agreement may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Holdco or the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns. 

 

(c)Purchaser and Seller shall file, as promptly as practicable, but in any
event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
notifications under the HSR Act. In the event that the Parties receive a
request for additional information or documentary materials after an initial
notification pursuant to the HSR Act, the Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to certify compliance with such requests, as
applicable, as promptly as possible and produce documents on a rolling basis,
and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any
such investigatory or review process. 

 

(d)Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Sale under the HSR Act. In connection therewith, if any
Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Sale as
violative of any Antitrust Laws, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly (to the
extent practicable) use their reasonable best efforts to initiate and/or
participate in any proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order
to (i) oppose or defend against any Action to prevent or enjoin the
consummation of the Sale and/or (ii) take such action as necessary to overturn
any regulatory Action by any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the
Sale, including by defending any such Action brought by any Governmental
Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or
terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Order that makes illegal or
prohibits the consummation of the Sale resulting from any such Action.
Purchaser shall, after reasonable consultation with Seller, have control over
the strategy and the right to direct all matters with any Governmental Entity
consistent with its obligations hereunder and (ii) it is agreed that Purchaser
shall, after reasonable consultation with Seller, make any strategic
decisions, including determining the strategy for contesting, litigating or
otherwise responding to objections to, or Action challenging, the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in
connection with discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and to
coordinate all activities with respect to any requests that may be made by, or
any Actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be sought
by or from, any Governmental Entity.

 

(e)In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser shall take all actions necessary
(including a Permitted Divestiture) to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate Order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any

   

businesses, product lines or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates, and (ii) otherwise
taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing would limit
Purchaser's, the Company's, any Company Subsidiary's, or their respective
Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates. In that regard
Purchaser shall and, if requested by Purchaser, Seller shall (but, subject to
each Party's obligations under this Agreement, including this Section 5.4, and
if not so requested by Purchaser shall not), agree to take any action with
respect to Purchaser's or its Affiliates' respective businesses and assets or
the Business, including agreeing to or otherwise effecting any sale,
divestiture, license, hold separate arrangement, or any limitation or
restriction on the freedom of action with respect to such businesses and
assets; provided, however, that no Party shall be obligated to take or agree
or commit to take, and Purchaser shall not discuss, propose, agree or commit
to take, any such action that is not conditioned on the Closing. No actions
taken pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be considered for purposes of
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or may reasonably be expected to occur. 

 

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Purchaser to take any action, including entering into
any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, that (i)
requires the divestiture of any assets of Purchaser or any Affiliates of
Purchaser, (ii) requires the divesture of any assets of Holdco, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that generated, in the aggregate, more than $28,000,000
of annual revenue between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017 (a divestiture
of assets of Holdco, the Company or any Company Subsidiary that generated
$28,000,000 or less of annual revenue during such period is referred to as a
"Permitted Divestiture") or (iii) that would limit in a non-de minimis manner
Purchaser's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, Holdco, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
portion thereof or any of Purchaser's or its Affiliates' other assets or
businesses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) a Permitted Divestiture
or (y) any such action with respect to assets of Holdco, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that generated, in the aggregate, $28,000,000 or less of
annual revenue between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017).

 

(g)Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, or shall agree to,
acquire, whether by merging with or into, consolidating with, purchasing all
or a portion of the assets of or all or a portion of the equity in, or
otherwise, any business or corporation, partnership, or other business
organization or division thereof or other Person, or dissolve, merge or
consolidate with any other Person, or engage in any business combination
transaction or sale, whether by merging with or into, consolidating with, or
selling all or a portion of its or its Affiliates' assets or equity to, any
other Person, or take any other action, including entering into, or agreeing
to enter into, any license, joint venture or other agreement or transaction,
which would reasonably be expected to, in each case or in the aggregate, (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not
obtaining, the expiration, termination or waiver of any applicable waiting
period or any consent, approval, permit, ruling, authorization, clearance or
other approval pursuant to the Antitrust Laws necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental
Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Sale, (iii) increase the risk of not being
able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise, (iv) materially delay or
impair, impede, hinder,

   

adversely affect or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Sale or (v) cause any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII to fail to be satisfied or materially delay or impair, impede,
hinder, adversely affect or prevent the ability of Purchaser and its
Affiliates to perform their obligations under this Agreement. Purchaser shall
not consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Sale, or withdraw its notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any registrations, applications,
declarations, reports, submissions or other filings made pursuant to any other
Antitrust Law unless Seller has given its prior written consent to such
extension or delay or withdrawal (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(h)Purchaser agrees to provide such security and assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by a
Governmental Entity in connection with any of Purchaser's otherwise applicable
obligations under this Section 5.4. Whether or not the Sale is consummated,
Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees to any Governmental Entity
in order to obtain any consent, clearance, expiration or termination of a
waiting period, authorization, Order or approval pursuant to this Section 5.4. 

 

5.5Consents

 

. Seller shall cause Holdco, the Company and each Company Subsidiary to,
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, to
obtain any consents or waivers required from third parties in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at or
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to
make any payments the funds for which have not been provided by Purchaser or
incur any Liability to obtain any consents of third parties contemplated by
this Section 5.5, and the failure to receive any such consents shall not, in
and of itself, be taken into account with respect to whether any condition to
the Closing set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied, nor shall any
Liability in respect of any such consent (or failure to obtain any such
consent, in and of itself) be reflected in the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital. 

 

5.6Public Announcements

 

. The Parties agree to consult with each other before issuing, and shall
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, including
the Sale, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, Order, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The Parties
hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Sale following the execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by Seller and Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 5.6 shall not apply to any press release or other public statement
made by the Parties or their respective Affiliates (a) that is consistent with
such agreed initial press release and the terms of this Agreement and does not
contain any information relating to the Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that has not been previously announced or made
public in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.6, (b) in the ordinary
course of business and does not relate to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (c) to report and disclose the status of
this Agreement, including the Sale, to its direct and indirect limited
partners and prospective limited partners, in each case on a

   

confidential basis, or in connection with fund raising, marketing, information
or reporting activities of the kind customarily provided with respect to
investments of this kind. 

 

5.7Insurance

 

. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of Holdco, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries. 

 

5.8Exculpation; Indemnification; DandO Insurance

 

. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit Holdco, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in such Person's Organizational
Documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any current or
former (as of the Closing) officer, partner, member, manager or director of
such Person (unless required by Law) with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing, it being the intent of the Parties that
such Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the full extent of the Law. Prior to, or substantially
concurrently with, the Closing, Seller shall purchase, or cause Holdco or the
Company to purchase, a six-year (6) prepaid tail insurance policy for the
Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance or other
liability insurance, in each case, that covers events occurring prior to the
Closing on terms and in amounts no less favorable to the Company's existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance; provided, however, none of
Seller, Holdco or the Company, as the case may be, shall be required to pay
for such "tail" policy or other insurance any amount in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement in
respect of such existing policy; provided, further, that if Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 5.8, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for each
year within such six-year (6) period for an aggregate amount equal to 300% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement in respect of such existing policy. If Purchaser, Holdco, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former (as of the Closing
Date) officer, partner, member, manager or director, as applicable, of Holdco,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and personal
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

(a)During the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company or one of Purchaser's Affiliates
to, provide each Continuing Employee with (i) an annual base salary or wage
rate and target incentive compensation opportunity that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than as was provided to such Continuing Employee prior to the
Closing, (ii) employee benefits (other than cash and equity-based long-term
incentives and change in control, retention, transition, stay or similar

   

arrangements) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing, (iii) cash and equity-based long-term incentives that are
substantially similar to the cash and equity-based long-term incentives
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates and
(iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
for which such Continuing Employee would be eligible under the severance plans
or policies of Purchaser or its Affiliates, in each case, determined after
taking into account each Continuing Employee's service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the Closing,
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries; provided that this undertaking shall not
obligate Purchaser to continue the employment of such Continuing Employees for
any period following the Closing. In addition, Purchaser will be responsible
for paying the Continuing Employees their annual bonuses for the year in which
the Closing occurs following year-end in the ordinary course and in amounts
consistent with what is accrued as the pre-Closing portion of annual bonuses
(as calculated under Section (c)(i) of the "Company Transaction Expenses"
definition) immediately prior to Closing, and incurred between the Closing
Date and year-end.

 

(b)For all purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements maintained by Purchaser, Holdco, the Company or one of the
Company Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee following
the Closing Date (collectively, the "Purchaser Plans"), including vesting,
eligibility to participate, vacation accrual and levels of benefits (but not
benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit plan of
Purchaser or vesting under any equity incentive plan) under any Purchaser
Plan, Purchaser will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of
service with the Company before the Closing, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that its
application would result in any duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, Purchaser will, subject in each case to
receipt of any required consent of the applicable Purchaser Plan provider, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Purchaser Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Purchaser Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
Purchaser Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) for the plan year in
which the Closing occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Purchaser Plan.

 

(c)Unless directed otherwise by Purchaser in writing at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company's
board of directors to adopt (and will cause any other sponsor of the
applicable Company Benefit Plan to adopt), at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, resolutions terminating any and all Company Benefit
Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Code, subject to the Closing occurring and effective no
later than the day

   

immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same
controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as
Purchaser (the "401(k) Termination Date"); provided that the form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
Purchaser, and Seller shall cause the Company to provide Purchaser evidence
that such resolutions have been adopted by the board of directors of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any other applicable Company
Benefit Plan sponsor, as applicable. If the Company 401(k) plan is terminated
pursuant to this Section 5.9(c), then as soon as practicable following the
401(k) Termination Date, Purchaser shall permit all Continuing Employees who
were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) plan immediately prior to
the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored by
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (a "Purchaser 401(k) Plan") , to the extent
such Continuing Employees are (after taking into account the first sentence of
Section 5.9(b)) eligible to participate in such Purchaser 401(k) Plans, and
Purchaser shall permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his
or her account balance when distributed from the terminated Company 401(k)
plan, including any outstanding participant loans to the applicable Purchaser
401(k) Plan. 

 

(d)Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan
or any employee or service provider program or arrangement of Purchaser or any
of its subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company prior
to the Closing), or (ii) constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment
to any of the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to
employees or other persons on, prior to or following the Closing. Nothing in
this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or
terminate any such plans or arrangements of Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan or Purchaser Plan).

 

(e)The Parties hereby agree that, following the date hereof, no communications
or other materials relating to post-Closing compensation and benefits or the
treatment of any Service Provider following the Closing Date, excluding for
this purpose with respect to any non-employee member of the board of
directors, communications or materials regarding the Company LTIP or otherwise
as may be required to be provided by applicable law, shall be made or
distributed to any Service Provider without Purchaser's prior written consent
and approval of any such communications or other materials, such consent and
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided however that the
Parties agree that such ordinary course and good faith interactions that may
arise in connection with the ordinary course administration and operation of
current compensation arrangements and welfare and retirement benefits, as well
as any other ordinary course actions permitted to be taken under this
Agreement (and the Company Disclosure Schedules) shall not constitute breaches
of this covenant.

 

5.10Section 280G Matters

 

. 

 

(a)To the extent that (x) any current or former Service Provider would be
entitled to any payment or benefit as a result of the Sale (either alone or
upon the occurrence of

   

any additional or subsequent events) and (y) such payment or benefit would or
could reasonably be expected to constitute a "parachute payment" under Section
280G of the Code or result in the imposition of any excise Tax imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code, the Company shall,

 

(i)at least one (1) Business Day prior to seeking the stockholder approval and
providing the disclosure described below in clauses (ii) and (iii), use
reasonable best efforts to obtain a binding written waiver by such Service
Provider (each, an "Excess Parachute Waiver") of any portion of such parachute
payment as exceeds three times such individual's "base amount" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code less one dollar (collectively, the
"Excess Parachute Payments") to the extent such Excess Parachute Payments are
not subsequently approved pursuant to a stockholder vote intended to satisfy
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury Regulations
§ 1.280G-1 thereunder (the "280G Stockholder Approval Requirements");

 

(ii)seek stockholder approval in a manner intended to satisfy the 280G
Stockholder Approval Requirements in respect of the Excess Parachute Payments
payable to all such Service Providers; and

 

(iii)provide disclosure intended to satisfy the 280G Stockholder Approval
Requirements to all Persons entitled to vote under Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii)
of the Code.

 

(b)In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser shall provide the Company with
all information reasonably necessary to allow the Company to determine whether
any payments made or to be made or benefits granted or to be granted pursuant
to any employment agreement or other agreement, arrangement or contract
entered into or negotiated by Purchaser together with all other payment and
benefits, could reasonably be considered to be "parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code at least ten (10) days prior to the
Closing Date (and shall further provide any such updated information as is
reasonably necessary prior to the Closing Date).

 

(c)Seller shall cause the Company to provide the Excess Parachute Waivers,
disclosure to holders of Company Shares and the form of consent of
stockholders to Purchaser for its prior review and comment, and the Company
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by Purchaser.

 

(d)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser written
evidence of satisfaction of the 280G Stockholder Approval Requirements or
written notice of the non-satisfaction thereof, as applicable.

 

5.11Section 16 Matters

 

. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any acquisitions or deemed acquisitions of shares of capital
stock of Purchaser (including derivative securities with respect to such
shares) resulting from the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each Person who may become or is reasonably expected to
become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") with respect to Purchaser
at or

   

immediately following the Closing to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

5.12Post-Closing Access to Books and Records.

 

(a)

 

(a)After the Closing, for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date,
upon receipt of reasonable prior notice, each Party agrees to provide, or
cause to be provided, to each other, as soon as reasonably practicable after
written request therefor and at the requesting Party's sole expense,
reasonable access during normal business hours, to the other Party's employees
(without substantial disruption of employment) and to any books, records,
documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title
and other papers relating to the conduct of the businesses of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date (the "Books and Records"),
to the extent reasonably available and in the possession or under the control
of the other Party that the requesting Party reasonably needs (i) to comply
with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the
requesting Party (including under applicable securities Laws) by a
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the requesting Party, (ii) for
use in any other judicial, regulatory, administrative or other proceeding, or
in order to satisfy Tax, audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or
other similar requirements; provided, that, if Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries post-Closing), on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation, nothing herein shall require either Party to
disclose any information within the scope, or related to the subject matter,
of such litigation (iii) in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or
election or any amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability
for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or any Tax audit or other Tax
Proceeding or (iv) to comply with its obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that no Party shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate any Law or
agreement, or waive any attorney-client or other similar privilege, and each
Party may redact information regarding itself or its subsidiaries or otherwise
not relating to businesses of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, and, in
the event such provision of information could reasonably be expected to
violate any Law or agreement or waive any attorney-client or other similar
privilege, the Parties shall take all reasonable measures to permit the
compliance with such obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or
consequence.

 

(b)Any information owned by a Party that is provided to a requesting Party
pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be deemed to remain the property of the
providing Party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as
granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such information.

 

5.13Related Party Agreements

 

. Seller hereby agrees to procure that, effective as of the Closing, all
Specified Related Party Agreements shall be terminated, assigned and novated,
released, canceled, paid or otherwise settled prior to the Closing, without
any continuing Liability or obligation thereunder of any party thereto or its
respective Related Parties, and that the same shall be of no further force and
effect, without any further action of any party and that no party thereto or
any of its respective Related Parties shall have any claim thereunder and
effective as of the Closing, and to the extent any such arrangements remain
following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all such

   

agreements and accounts to be terminated, released, canceled, paid or
otherwise settled following the Closing without any Liability or obligations
to any party thereto or any of its respective Related Parties, in all cases
excluding (w) any employment, severance, indemnification or other similar

5.14Exclusivity

 

. From the date hereof until the Closing (or earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms), Seller shall not (and shall cause
Holdco and its Subsidiaries not to) and shall direct its respective
Representatives (on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any
action to knowingly solicit, initiate or encourage an Acquisition Proposal or
(b) continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any nonpublic information relating to Holdco and its Subsidiaries to,
any Person (other than Purchaser and its Representatives) that, to the
Knowledge of the Company, is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this Section 5.14 an "Acquisition Proposal" shall
mean (i) any offer or proposal for a sale of all or a material portion of (x)
the assets of Holdco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) the
Membership Interests (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or (ii) any proposal to effect any conversion,
consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Holdco.

 

5.15Company Debt Payoff Letters

 

. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser, in
customary form, debt payoff letters with respect to the Company Credit
Agreements (the "Company Debt Payoff Letters"). Any Company Debt Payoff Letter
shall specify the amount of Repayment Indebtedness that will be outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing under the Company Credit Agreement to which
such Company Debt Payoff Letter relates and provide for the release of all
Liens over the properties and assets of any of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries securing any obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries party thereto pursuant to the terms of such Company Credit
Agreement (subject only to the receipt by the holders of such Indebtedness of
the applicable payoff amounts set forth in the corresponding payoff letter,
the termination of all commitments under such Company Credit Agreement and the
cash collateralization of any outstanding letters of credit or similar
Indebtedness outstanding thereunder).

 

5.16Debt Financing

 

(a). (a)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Seller shall cause the
Company, in connection with the Debt Financing, (x) to or to cause its
Representatives, including legal and accounting representatives, to prepare
and furnish to Purchaser the Required Information, and (y) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate with the marketing efforts for any portion
of the Debt Financing, including by causing members of management and using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause other Representatives of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries with appropriate seniority and expertise to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including one-on-one meetings
or conference calls with the Financing Sources, presentations, road shows,
drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies and other syndication activities, all
at mutually agreed times and upon reasonable advance notice; (ii) reasonably
assist in the preparation of (A) materials for

   

rating agency presentations and (B) any offering documents, syndication

and other similar documents (collectively, the "Offering Documentation"), in
each case, to the extent customarily needed for financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter all at mutually agreed times and
upon reasonable advance notice; (iii) request that the Company's independent
accountants provide any necessary customary consents to use their audit
reports relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in any Offering
Documentation and any customary comfort letters, as reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with any offering of debt securities constituting a
portion of the Debt Financing; (iv) provide customary authorization letters,
to the extent contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, authorizing the
distribution of information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to any Financing Source and containing a customary representation
to the Financing Sources as to such information relating to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (v) furnish Purchaser and any Financing Source
reasonably promptly all documentation and other information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries required by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer",
beneficial ownership and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, in each case as
shall have been reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and solely to the extent required by
the Debt Commitment Letter; (vi) provide financial information regarding the
Company customarily included in offering memoranda for private placements or
registered offerings of debt securities of Purchaser of the type contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof and cooperate
with the Financing Sources' requests for customary due diligence materials as
are reasonably available to it and are reasonably requested by Purchaser; and
(vii) ensure that Purchaser benefits from the existing lending relationships
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; provided that any such requested
assistance to be provided pursuant to this Section 5.16 does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.
Seller hereby consents (and shall cause the Company to consent) to the use of
the Company's logos in connection with the Debt Financing in a form and manner
mutually agreed in advance with the Company; provided, however, that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely,
to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company
or any of its products, services, offerings or intellectual property rights.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.16, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Seller or the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives to (1) provide (x) any financial
information with respect to any fiscal quarter for which financial statements
are not required under the definition of Required Information, (y) any pro
forma financial statements or information, or (z) prepare any financial
statements or information that are not available to it and prepared in the
ordinary course of its financial reporting practice, (2) enter into, execute
or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any
change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement, (3) pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Debt Financing or cause any of the Persons who are officers
or directors of Seller, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to do
so, (4) agree to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior
to Closing or have any

   

obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any
agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective until the Closing,
(5) cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (6) provide access to
or disclose information that the Seller, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of any
of them or (7) take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with or violate this Agreement, its Organizational Documents or any applicable
Laws. Nothing contained in this Section 5.16(a) or otherwise shall require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer
or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall (i)
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Seller, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees,
costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by them in
connection with the cooperation or assistance contemplated by this Section
5.16 and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives, from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any
information used in connection therewith and the performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 5.16. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this
Section 5.16(a), represent the sole obligation of the Seller, Holdco, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with
respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing
(including the Debt Financing) to be obtained by Purchaser with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to
expand or modify such obligations.

 

(b)Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain funds sufficient
to fund the Required Amount on or prior to the date upon which the Sale is
required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, Purchaser shall take or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions as described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including by (i)
negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (the "Definitive Debt Financing Agreements"), (ii)
satisfying on a timely basis (or obtaining waiver of) all conditions
applicable to Purchaser to obtain such Financing as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, (iii) until the funding of the Debt Financing at or prior
to the Closing, maintaining in full force and effect the Debt Commitment
Letter, (iv) complying with its obligations and enforcing its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter and Definitive Debt Financing Agreements in a timely
and diligent manner and (v) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, consummating the Debt Financing at or prior to the
date that the Closing is required to be effected pursuant to Section 2.3;
provided that to the extent that Purchaser obtains funds at or prior to
Closing (and Purchaser applies such funds at Closing to the payment of the
Required Amount) from the issuance of unsecured bonds as contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser will not be required to fund the
corresponding amount of Debt Financing at Closing.

   

(c)Purchaser will not permit any amendment, supplement, modification or
replacement to be made to, or permit any assignment of, or agree to permit any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the Company's prior written
consent, except that Purchaser may amend, supplement, modify or replace the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (including
by joining one or more additional lenders or agents as parties thereto, or by
reallocating commitments or reassigning titles or roles to, or between or
among, any entities party thereto (including replacement of a lender)) if such
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement: (i) could not (A)
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Sale or the Debt Financing, (B) adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to
satisfy the conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing or (C)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing; (ii) does not add new (or
adversely modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing and (ii) does not adversely impact the ability
of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement. Purchaser will
promptly provide Seller with copies of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement. Purchaser will not terminate the Debt Commitment
Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement other than in connection
with a replacement thereof that complies with the first sentence of this
clause (c).

 

(d)In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter,
regardless of the reason therefor, and such portion is reasonably necessary to
fund the Required Amount, Purchaser will as promptly as reasonably practicable
notify the Company of such unavailability and use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
substitute financing that does not include any conditions to the consummation
of such substitute financing that are more onerous than the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof and in
an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing that is
available, to fund the Required Amount ("Substitute Financing"). In the event
any Substitute Financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 5.16(d),
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing will be deemed to refer to
such Substitute Financing (in lieu of the Debt Financing replaced thereby),
and if one or more commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are
entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Substitute
Financing (such commitment letters, the "Substitute Commitment Letters"),
references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter will be deemed to
refer to the Substitute Commitment Letters (in lieu of the Debt Commitment
Letter replaced thereby), and all obligations of Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 5.16(d) will be applicable thereto to the same extent as Purchaser's
obligations with respect to the Debt Financing replaced thereby. Purchaser
will deliver to the Company complete and accurate copies of any Substitute
Commitment Letters and definitive agreements with respect to the Substitute
Financing promptly upon the execution thereof.

 

5.17LTIP Payments

take the actions with respect to the Company LTIP set forth on Section 5.17 of
the Disclosure Schedule.

   

5.18Retention Repayment

 

(a). With respect to the amounts payable under those certain Retention Bonus
Letters and Management by Objectives Bonus Letter Agreements set forth on
Section 3.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and any other retention or "stay
put" bonuses, in each case, that are included as Company Transaction Expenses
on the Final Closing Statement, if any, (collectively, the "Retention Bonus
Agreements"), within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar
quarter in which no further obligations remain under a Retention Bonus
Agreement in accordance with its respective terms, Purchaser shall provide to
Seller a written accounting of all payments that are paid and forfeited
pursuant to such Retention Bonus Agreement. Seller shall have thirty (30)
days to review each such accounting, and Purchaser shall promptly provide any
supporting documentation as may be reasonably requested by Seller regarding
the same during such period. During each such thirty-day period, Purchaser
and Seller shall mutually agree in good faith to the aggregate amount paid and
forfeited under any Retention Bonus Agreements with respect to such quarterly
period (each such aggregate forfeited amount, a "Quarterly Retention
Reimbursement Amount"). Promptly following each such determination (and in
any event within fifteen (15) Business Days thereof) Purchaser shall remit to
Seller (or its designee) the applicable Quarterly Retention Reimbursement
Amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account
(or accounts) specified by Seller in writing.

 

5.19Registration Rights; 19.9% Cap; Standstill; Microsoft License

 

. 

 

(a)Purchaser and Seller shall execute (or, in the case of Seller, procure the
execution by its applicable Affiliate) and deliver, at or prior to the
Closing, the Registration Rights Agreement and the No-Hire Agreement.

 

(b)In the event that the Equity Consideration for a period of four (4)
consecutive Business Days (calculated as if each such Business Day was the
Closing Date, but without giving effect to the proviso in the definition of
"Equity Consideration" hereunder) has exceeded 19.9% of the number of issued
and outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser shall, within one
Business Day thereof, notify Seller of such event.

 

(c)From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall procure
that its Related Parties (other than any director, managing member or officer
of Siris Capital Group, LLC or any other individuals) shall not, directly or
indirectly, take any action to (i) acquire, agree to acquire, propose, seek or
offer to acquire, or knowingly facilitate the acquisition or ownership of, any
shares of Purchaser Common Stock (other than the Equity Consideration) or (ii)
enter into any Contract, option, swap, forward, prepaid forward, put, call,
collar, future, other derivative transaction or other agreement, arrangement
or undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment,
transfer (including by operation of law) or other disposition of or transfer
of any interest in any shares of Purchaser Common Stock that has the effect of
hedging Seller's exposure to changes in the market price of the Equity
Consideration.

 

(d)At the written request of either Purchaser or Seller, at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to, without
any additional consideration, (i) assign and transfer to Purchaser all of its
rights under, (and Purchaser shall assume all of the Company's obligations
under) the Confidential Patent License for Microsoft Rights Management
Services Protocols, dated as of May 17, 2015, between Intralinks, Inc. and

   

Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, which assignment and assumption shall be
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and shall be effective
immediately prior to the consummation of the Sale and (ii) take all necessary
action to effect such assignment, including providing or causing to be
provided all documentation and notifications required in connection with such
assignment.

 

Article VI

6.1Transfer Taxes

 

. All sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, registration,

(including by reimbursing the other party). The parties shall cooperate to
prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to

other party. The parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith to
establish any available exemption or reduction in applicable Transfer Taxes.

 

6.2Straddle Periods

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining Specified Current Taxes, the amount of any Income Taxes included
in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to include the amount
that would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date; provided that (1) the taxable year of any Subsidiary or former
Subsidiary of the Company that is a "controlled foreign corporation" (as
defined in the Code) shall be deemed to have closed on the Closing Date,
including for purposes of computing any inclusion under Sections 951 and 951A
of the Code and (2) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated
on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall
be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period. For the avoidance of doubt, Specified Current Taxes shall be
calculated by assuming that each Tax Return in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period will be filed in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or as set forth in the definition of Specified
Current Taxes.

Company and the Company Subsidiaries (other than (i) any Tax Sharing Agreement
solely between Holdco, the Company and/or one or more Subsidiaries and (ii)
any indemnification provisions for Taxes contained in credit agreements,
leases or other commercial agreements the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes) shall be terminated as of, or prior to, the Closing Date.
After such date, none of Holdco, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and
Seller and its Affiliates shall have any further rights, liabilities or
obligations thereunder.

   

6.4Section 483. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to
Section 483 of the Code, payments made by Purchaser to Seller more than six
months after Closing will be treated as interest for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to the extent required by Section 483 of the Code.

the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and its Recourse Related Parties
for any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Recourse Related Parties, that the absence of
coverage under the Purchaser Representation and Warranty Policy for any
reason, including due to exclusions from coverage thereunder or the failure of
the Purchaser Representation and Warranty Policy to be in full force and
effect for any reason, will not expand, alter, amend, change or otherwise
affect Seller's liability under this Agreement.

respect to fraud, the Purchaser Representation and Warranty Policy shall
include a provision whereby the insurer expressly waives any subrogation
rights against Seller or any of Seller's Recourse Related Parties with respect
to any claim made by any insured thereunder. No insured party under the
Purchaser Representation and Warranty Policy shall waive, amend, modify or
otherwise revise this subrogation provision, or allow such provision to be
waived, amended, modified, or otherwise revised without the prior written
consent of Seller.

 

9.2Survival of Covenants and Agreements

 

.

 

(a)All covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement that require
performance prior to the Closing shall survive for three (3) months from the

to be performed after the Closing; provided, that no Party shall have any
Liability to the other Party for any breach (or breaches) of the covenants
that survive pursuant to this Section 9.2(a) unless, and solely to the extent,
that such other Party's Losses arising from such breach (or breaches) are in
excess of $2,000,000 in the aggregate; provided, however, the limitation in
the foregoing proviso shall not apply to any willful or intentional breach.

   

(b)All covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement that require
performance after the Closing (but solely to the extent such covenants are to
be performed after the Closing) shall survive for a period for 60 days
following the date on which the performance of such covenant is required to be
completed.

 

9.3Limitation of Liability

this Agreement or any related agreement to the other Party or its
Representatives for any consequential damages, special damages, incidental or
indirect damages, loss of revenue or profits, diminution in value, damages
based on multiple of revenue or earnings or other performance metric, loss of
business reputation, punitive and exemplary damages or any similar damages,
except to the extent such punitive or exemplary damages result from any final,
non-appealable Action brought by a third party are otherwise recoverable
hereunder. Anything else to the contrary notwithstanding, no Losses shall be
recovered under this Agreement to the extent that such Loss was taken into
account in the calculation of the Cash Purchase Price as finally determined
hereunder.

. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns;
provided, that no Party may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its
rights or delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without
the express prior written consent of the other Party to this Agreement, except
that (a) Seller may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part,
its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Seller, but any such
transfer or assignment will not relieve Seller of any of its obligations
hereunder and (b) Purchaser may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to

10.9Amendments and Waivers

 

. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument or
instruments in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any
such modification or amendment is sought. Any Party to this Agreement may,

Agreement with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such
other Party to this Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by
any Party to this Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No

exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

 

10.10Severability

 

. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

 

10.11Specific Performance

 

. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party
agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the other Party
of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching
Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it, whether in law or equity) to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Parties agree that Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance against Purchaser to enforce Purchaser's efforts obligations under
Section 5.4, and to prevent any breach by Purchaser of its covenants under
this Agreement and to cause Purchaser to consummate the Sale and to effect the
Closing in accordance with Article II.

(a)Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to waive and not to assert,
any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation,
after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of Seller or any
of its Affiliates (any such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, by any legal counsel currently representing Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
and Katz (the "Current Representation").

 

(b)Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to waive and not to assert,
any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or protection with
respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any
Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with
Purchaser or its Affiliates, and following the Closing, with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, it being the intention of the Parties hereto that all
such rights to such attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or
protection and to control such attorney-client and other applicable legal
privilege or protection shall be retained by Seller and that Seller, and not
Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall have
the sole right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege or protection. Accordingly, from and after
Closing, none of Purchaser, its Affiliates, Holdco, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall have any access to any such communications or to the files of
the Current Representation, all of which shall be and remain the property of
Seller and not of Purchaser, its Affiliates, Holdco, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or to internal counsel relating to such engagement, and
none of Purchaser, its Affiliates, Holdco, the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Person acting or purporting to act on their behalf shall seek to obtain
the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege and protection
attaching to such communications and files belong to Seller.

 

10.13No Recourse

 

. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be made only against a
Party and only with respect to the specific obligations undertaken by such

obligations or liabilities based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and no Person who is not a

based upon any theory that seeks to impose Losses of an entity party against
its owners or affiliates) for any Losses arising under, in connection with or
related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, non-
performance, interpretation, termination, enforcement, construction or
execution or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Seller and
Purchaser hereby

   

waives and releases all such Losses, claims, Actions and obligations against
any such Person, including such other Party's Recourse Related Parties. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement, or any other agreement referenced herein
or therein or otherwise to the contrary, each Party hereto covenants, agrees
and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, that no
recourse under this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein or
therein or in connection with any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including the Sale) shall be sought or had against any Person not a party to
this Agreement, including the other Party's Non-Recourse Parties, it being
expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or losses
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any
Person that is not a Party to this Agreement.

 

10.14No Admission

 

. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Purchaser, Seller or any of
its Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding by or on behalf of a third party,
that Purchaser, Seller or any of its Affiliates, or that such third party or
any of its respective Affiliates, is or is not in breach or violation of, or
in default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any
contract. 

 

10.15Counterparts

 

. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic method shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

 

10.16Financing Sources

 

. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller on
behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its controlled Affiliates
hereby: (a) agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, none of Seller, its Subsidiaries or any of their controlled Affiliates
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Party in their capacity
as such (and none of the Financing Parties in their capacities as such shall
be liable to the Seller, its Subsidiaries or any of its controlled Affiliates
for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including,
without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings)) in
each case in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, and (by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, each Financing Party
agrees that) no Financing Party shall have any rights or claims against any
such Person in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the foregoing will not limit the rights of
the parties to the Debt Financing under any commitment letter related thereto;
(b) agrees that any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Parties in their capacities
as such, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter)
entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,

   

New York, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably
submits itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (c) agrees that any such Action shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws
of another state), except as otherwise provided in the Debt Commitment Letter
or other applicable definitive document relating to the Debt Financing; (d)
agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to
bring or support any Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in their capacity as such in any way arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough
of Manhattan, New York, New York; (e) agrees that service of process, summons,

the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder;

10.16; and (j) agrees that the provisions of this Section 10.16 (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of this
Section 10.16) and the definitions of "Financing Sources"and "Financing
