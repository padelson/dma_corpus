of insurance, except for any Mortgage Loan as to which the ineligibility for
such sale or issuance of insurance would not be the contractual or legal

compensation paid or other incentives made available by the Company to any
third party (including, as applicable, a broker or correspondent lender) in

Section 4.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) GHIV has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, all required
registration statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with the
SEC since January 23, 2020 (collectively, as they have been amended since the
time of their filing and including all exhibits or schedules thereto and any
other information incorporated therein, the " _SEC Reports_ "). GHIV has
furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments and
modifications that have not been filed by GHIV with the SEC to
all agreements, documents and other instruments that were previously filed by
GHIV with the SEC and are currently in effect. Each of the SEC Reports at the
time of its filing or being furnished complied, or if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply or, if amended, complied as of the date of the most
recent amendment, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the SEC Reports in
effect as of the respective dates thereof. None of the SEC Reports, as of
their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
with respect to the SEC Reports. The audited financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements (including, in each case, the notes
and schedules thereto) included in the SEC Reports (the " _GHIV Financial
Statements_ ") complied or will comply, as the case may be, as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC, the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act in effect as of the respective dates
thereof with respect thereto, were prepared or will be prepared, as the case
may be, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto
and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) and fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements included therein, to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of complete footnotes) in all material respects the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of GHIV as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods then ended.

(b) GHIV has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure
that material information relating to GHIV is made known to GHIVs principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during
the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. To GHIVs knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting GHIVs principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in
GHIVs periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

 

(c) GHIV has established and maintained a system of internal controls and, to
GHIVs knowledge, such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of GHIVs financial reporting and the
preparation of the GHIV Financial Statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.

 



54

    

(d) To the knowledge of GHIV, each director and executive officer of GHIV has
filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required by Section 16(a)

against GHIV, and (b) GHIV is not subject to any continuing Governmental
Order.

Section 4.8  _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as would not have a GHIV
Material Adverse Effect, GHIV is, and since January 1, 2020, has been, in
compliance with all applicable Laws. GHIV is in possession of all Permits
necessary for GHIV to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where failure to have such
Permits would not be material to SFS Corp., the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

Section 4.9 _Financial Ability; Trust Account_. There is at least $425,000,000
(less, as of the Closing, the Redemption Amount payable to the holders of
GHIV Class A Common Stock who have validly exercised their right to receive
payment pursuant to the GHIV Stock Redemption, if any) invested in a trust
account (the " _Trust Account_ "), maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, acting as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), pursuant to that certain
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated January 23, 2020, by and between
GHIV and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). Prior to the Closing, none
of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released, except in accordance
with the Trust Agreement and GHIV Organizational Documents. Amounts in the
Trust Account are invested in United States "government securities" within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a
maturity of one hundred and eighty-five (185) days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act. GHIV has performed all material obligations required
to be performed by it to date under, and is not in material default or
delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in
connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred that, with due
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default thereunder.
There are no claims or proceedings pending with respect to the Trust
Account. Since January 23, 2020, GHIV has not released any money from the
Trust Account except as permitted pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the GHIV
Organizational Documents. As of the Closing, the obligations of GHIV to
dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the GHIV Organizational Documents shall
terminate, and as of the Closing, GHIV shall have no obligation whatsoever
pursuant to the GHIV Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the
assets of GHIV by reason of the consummation of the Transactions. The Trust
Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance
with its terms and has not been amended or modified. There are no separate
Contracts, side letters or other arrangements or understandings (whether
written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of
the Trust Agreement in the SEC Reports to be inaccurate or that would entitle
any Person (other than pursuant to a GHIV Stock Redemption, if any) to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. There are no proceedings
pending with or, to the knowledge of GHIV, threatened by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Trust Account.

Section 4.11 _Business Activities_. Since its incorporation, GHIV has not
conducted any business activities other than activities directed toward
completing a Business Combination. Except as set forth in the GHIV
Organizational Documents, there is no agreement, commitment or Governmental

reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or impairing any
business practice of GHIV, other than such effects which have had a GHIV
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.12 _Material Contracts_. The SEC Reports include true, correct and
complete copies of each "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Regulation S-K of the SEC) to which GHIV is party (the " _GHIV Material
Contracts_ "). Each GHIV Material Contract is in full force and effect and, to
the knowledge of GHIV, is valid and binding upon and enforceable against each
of the parties thereto, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. True, correct and complete copies of all
GHIV Material Contracts have been made available to the Company.

Section 4.13 _Employees_. Other than as described in the SEC Reports, GHIV has
never had any employees. Other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by GHIVs officers and directors in connection with
activities on GHIVs behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the
amount of cash held by GHIV outside of the Trust Account, GHIV has no
unsatisfied material liability with respect to any employee. GHIV does not
currently maintain or have any direct liability under any benefit plan, and
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Ancillary
Agreements nor the consummation of the Transactions will (a) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any director, officer or
employee of GHIV, or (b) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits.

 

Section 4.14 _Undisclosed_ _Liabilities_ _; Transaction Expenses_.

absolute, contingent or otherwise) against GHIV, except for liabilities and
obligations: (i) provided for, or otherwise reflected or reserved for, in the
financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference in the

disclosed as are not and would not be, in the aggregate, material to GHIV); or

period ended June 30, 2020 in the ordinary course of the operation of
business of GHIV (other than any such liabilities as are not and would not be,

to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on Nasdaq under the symbol

if, at any time prior to obtaining the GHIV Stockholder Approval, the GHIV
Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that a GHIV Intervening Event has occurred
and that, as a result thereof, a failure to withdraw or modify a GHIV Board
Recommendation would constitute a breach by the GHIV Board of its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, then the GHIV Board may withdraw or modify
such GHIV Board Recommendation; _provided_ that GHIV shall not withdraw or
modify such GHIV Board Recommendation unless (i) GHIV first delivers to SFS
Corp. and the 

 



64

Board proposes to take such action and containing the material facts
underlying the GHIV Boards determination that a GHIV Intervening Event has
occurred and that a failure to withdraw or modify a GHIV Board Recommendation
would constitute a breach by the GHIV Board of its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law (a " _GHIV Intervening Event Notice_ "), and (ii) at or after
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately following
the day on which GHIV delivered the GHIV Intervening Event Notice

Intervening Event shall require a new notice, but with an additional three (3)
Business Day (instead of four (4) Business Day) period from the date of such
notice), the " _GHIV Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the GHIV Board
reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that a failure to withdraw or modify such GHIV Board
Recommendation would constitute a breach by the GHIV Board of its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law. If requested by SFS Corp. or the Company,
GHIV shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, during the GHIV Intervening Event Notice Period, engage
in good faith negotiations with SFS Corp., the Company and their respective
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need for any withdrawal or modification of
such GHIV Board Recommendation.

should be discovered by GHIV which is required to be set forth in an amendment
or a supplement to the GHIV Proxy Statement by the applicable requirements of
the Federal Securities Laws, GHIV shall promptly inform SFS Corp. and the
Company. All documents that GHIV is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions will comply as to form and substance in all
material aspects with the applicable requirements of the Federal Securities

Proposals_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, GHIV shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting
(A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the GHIV Proxy Statement
that the GHIV Board has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law
be disclosed to GHIV Common Stockholders and for such supplement or amendment
to be promptly disseminated to GHIV Common Stockholders prior to the Special

described in such clauses have been resolved.

believe of the Disclosing Party, would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege or other privilege from disclosure. All information obtained by a
Party pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall remain subject to the
Nondisclosure Agreement prior to the Closing. No investigation pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this

the respective Organizational Documents of SFS Corp., the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or the indemnification agreements set forth on _Schedule

(d) The obligations of GHIV, UWM LLC, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall survive the Closing and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified
Person to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ applies without the written consent
of such affected Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Persons to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, each of whom may enforce
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_).

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance

distribution of amounts held in the Trust Account except in accordance with
the Trust Agreement and the GHIV Organizational Documents. Upon satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ and provision of
notice thereof to the Trustee (which notice GHIV shall provide to the Trustee
in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement), (a) in accordance with
and pursuant to the Trust Agreement, at the Closing, GHIV shall (i) cause the
documents, opinions and notices required to be delivered to the Trustee
pursuant to the Trust Agreement to be so delivered, and (ii) use reasonable
commercial efforts to cause the Trustee to (A) pay as and when due all amounts
payable to GHIV Common Stockholders who shall have previously validly elected

(b) For and in consideration of GHIV entering into this Agreement,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, SFS Corp., the
Company and UWM LLC agree that, notwithstanding any other provision contained
in this Agreement, SFS Corp., the Company, UWM LLC and the Company
Subsidiaries do not now have, and shall not at any time prior to the Closing
have, any claim to, or make any claim against, the Trust Account, regardless
of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in
any way to, the business relationship between, SFS Corp., the Company, UWM
LLC or the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and GHIV, on the other hand,
this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, each of SFS Corp., the Company and UWM LLC hereby irrevocably
waives any right, title, interest or claim it (or any Company Subsidiary) may
have, now or in the future in or to the Trust Account and agrees not to seek
recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as a
result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with GHIV, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing waiver will not limit or prohibit or limit SFS Corp., the
Company, UWM LLC or the Company Subsidiaries from (i) pursuing a claim
against GHIV pursuant to this Agreement for specific performance or other
equitable relief in connection with the Transactions or (ii) pursuing any
claims that SFS Corp., the Company, UWM LLC or the Company Subsidiaries may
have against GHIVs assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account. In
the event that SFS Corp., the Company, UWM LLC or any Company Subsidiary
commences any Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to GHIV, which Action seeks, in whole or
in part, relief against the Trust Account in violation of the foregoing, GHIV
shall be entitled to recover from SFS Corp., the Company, UWM LLC or the
Company Subsidiaries the associated legal fees and costs in connection with
any such Action, in the event GHIV prevails in such Action.

(a) _Allocation of Taxes for Straddle Periods_. For any Straddle Period, Taxes
shall be treated as attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period in an amount

basis of the deemed closing of the books and records of the Company at the end
of the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of any Taxes other than gross
receipts, income Taxes, or similar Taxes, the Taxes for the entire Straddle

that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and applicable state and local Tax

case of each of (A) and (B), in exchange for partnership interests in UWM LLC

the notice regarding whether or not any of the conditions to the Closing have
been satisfied or in determining whether or not any of the representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement have been breached.
No notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall affect any

ARTICLE VIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1  _Non Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_.
The representations, warranties, agreements and covenants in this Agreement
shall terminate at the Closing, except that (a) those covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part
after the Closing shall survive the Closing as provided therein and then only
with respect to any breaches occurring after the Closing, (b) the covenants
and agreements in _Sections 2.4_ ,  _2.5_ , _5.8_ , _5.10_ , _5.12_ and
_5.18_ shall survive the Closing for such time as provided in such Sections,
and (c) this _Article VIII_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely. Effective
as of the Closing, there are no remedies available to the Parties with
respect to any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties to this Agreement, except, with respect to those
covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to
be performed in whole or in part after the Closing, the remedies that may be
available under _Section_ __ _ 8.14_.

 

Section 8.2 _Modification or Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified in whole or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing
executed in the same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to
this Agreement. The approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of any of
the Parties shall not restrict the ability of the board of directors
(or comparable body) of any of the parties to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or to cause such Party to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. 

Section 8.3 _Extension; Waiver_. GHIV may (on behalf of itself) and the
Company may (on behalf of itself, UWM LLC or SFS Corp.), at any time prior to
the Closing, by action taken by its board of directors (or comparable body) or
officers thereunto duly authorized: (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties; (b) to the extent
permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein by any other Party or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto by such other Party; or (c) waive compliance with
any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or agree to an amendment or
modification to this Agreement in the manner contemplated by _Section_ __ _
8.2_ and by an agreement in writing executed in the same manner (but not
necessarily by the same Persons) as this Agreement. The failure or delay of
any Party to this Agreement to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement
shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver by such Party of such
right.

request, demand, waiver, consent, approval or other communication (any of the
foregoing, a " _Notice_ ") that is required or permitted hereunder shall be in

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any part

Section 8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any
Person, other than the Parties, any right or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the Closing occurs, the present and former officers
and directors of the Company (and their successors, heirs and Representatives)
are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section_ __ _
5.10_.

 

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 8.10 _Jurisdiction_. In any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions: (a) each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the
matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware); (b) each of the Parties irrevocably waives and agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave from such court; and (c) each of the Parties agrees that it will not
bring any such action in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over
the matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware).

 



82

    

Section 8.11 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH
PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES (AND SHALL CAUSE
ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES TO WAIVE) THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF
DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) THIS WAIVER IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE OTHER PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND
(B) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER.

 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 8.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions, whether or not the Transactions are
consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and
accountants; _provided_ , that UWM LLC or the Company shall be liable for
and pay all Transaction Expenses of UWM LLC, SFS Corp. and the Company
accruing prior to and through the Closing and all such Transaction Expenses
shall be paid or provided for prior to the calculation of Closing Cash as of
the Reference Time;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Transaction Expenses
of GHIV shall not exceed $36,000,000. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_ , then SFS Corp. shall reimburse GHIV for all
reasonable and documented Transaction Expenses relating to printing, filing
and mailing the GHIV Proxy Statement and all SEC and other regulatory filing
fees incurred in connection with the GHIV Proxy Statement.

 

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any Party does not perform its
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, each without proof of damages, prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, none of the Parties would have
entered into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it shall not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other

 



83

    

 Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.14_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such injunction.

Section 8.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions may only be brought against, the entities that
are expressly named as Parties, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent
a named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (a) no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (b) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of SFS Corp., the Company, UWM LLC or GHIV
under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement or the Transactions.
