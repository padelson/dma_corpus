Bancshares Financials, and all such accruals and reserves for Taxes, as adjusted for operations and transactions and the passage
of time for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of Bancshares and its Subsidiaries,

an authority in a jurisdiction where Bancshares or Cornerstone or their Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that Bancshares or
