documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, (i) the holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall pay and deliver to such
holder, that portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder shall

satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of SmartFinancial Stock

the Merger Consideration payable or issuable in respect thereof as herein
provided. Until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall, at and
after the Effective Time, evidence and represent only the right to receive
that portion of the Merger Consideration payable or issuable in respect
thereof (or the SmartFinancial Stock represented thereby) in accordance with
this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions payable or distributable
on or with respect to shares of Bancshares Common Stock or Bancshares SBLF
Equivalent Stock that are issued or issuable in connection with the Merger in
accordance with this Agreement will be remitted to any Person entitled to

distributions payable in respect thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange
Agent to Bancshares. Any former shareholder of SmartFinancial who has not
theretofore complied with the exchange procedures provided for in this
Agreement shall thereafter look only to Bancshares for that portion of the
Merger Consideration (and any other amounts) deliverable in respect of the
shares of SmartFinancial Stock previously held by such shareholder, as

the Exchange Agent nor any Party to this Agreement shall be liable to any

applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. Bancshares and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
SmartFinancial to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration (and any other amounts) specified in this Agreement,
which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute regarding the ownership of SmartFinancial Stock, Bancshares and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any portion of the Merger
Consideration (or any other amounts) payable in respect thereof in escrow with
an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Rights as SmartFinancial Shareholders_. Holders of
SmartFinancial Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at and
after the Effective Time, cease to be shareholders of SmartFinancial and
shall have no further rights as shareholders of SmartFinancial, other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable or
issuable in respect of such holders' SmartFinancial Stock in accordance with
this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.4 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a share of Bancshares Common
Stock, and no certificate or scrip therefor, will be issued in connection
with the Merger to any holder of shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock.

Book-Entry Shares delivered by a holder of SmartFinancial Common Stock, the
number of shares of Bancshares Common Stock issuable to such holder shall (if
not a whole number) be rounded up to the next whole share (i.e., both 9.1 and
9.9 would round to 10.0).

  



  

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

of SmartFinancial Common Stock the holder of which has perfected his or her
right to dissent from the Merger pursuant to Chapter 23 of the Corporation
Act, and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into
and canceled in exchange for, or represent a right to receive, the Per Share
Common Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the Corporation Act. Bancshares shall be
entitled to retain any Merger Consideration not paid on account of Dissenting
Shares, and the shareholders of SmartFinancial shall not be entitled to any
portion of such retained Merger Consideration. Any payments made in respect of
Dissenting Shares shall be made by Bancshares within the time period set
forth in the Corporation Act.

  



  

(b) If any holder of shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock who
asserts such holder's right to dissent from the Merger pursuant to Chapter 23
of the Corporation Act shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her
right to dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later, the
shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock held by such holder shall be converted
into and cancelled in exchange for, on a share by share basis, the right
to receive the Per Share Common Consideration in accordance with the

from the date of this Agreement until immediately prior to the Effective Time

Bancshares shall occur, including without limitation by reason of any stock
dividend, distribution paid in stock, stock subdivision or reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination (including without limitation
the Reverse Stock Split), or exchange or readjustment of shares, then the
consideration payable or issuable to holders of SmartFinancial Stock pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change;

Stock upon the exercise of Bancshares Options, the issuance of shares of
SmartFinancial Stock upon the exercise of SmartFinancial Options, nor the

Transaction shall cause or result in an adjustment of or to the consideration
payable or issuable to holders of SmartFinancial Stock hereunder.

  



  

Section 3.8 _SmartFinancial Options_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding SmartFinancial Option,
whether vested or unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into an option to purchase that number
of shares of Bancshares Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
SmartFinancial Stock issuable upon the exercise of such SmartFinancial Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio,
and the per share exercise price of such option to purchase shares of
Bancshares Common Stock shall be equal to the per share exercise price of the
SmartFinancial Option immediately prior to the Effective Time  _divided by_
the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(b) Those SmartFinancial Options which are incentive stock options
(as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall, at the Effective Time

written agreement and acknowledgement to the SmartFinancial Parties with
regard to the cancellation and conversion of their SmartFinancial Options in

Bancshares or its Subsidiaries included in the Cornerstone Securities Filings
complied as to form, as of the respective date of filing, in all material
respects, with applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Since June 30, 2011,
Bancshares and each of Bancshares' directors and officers have been, and
Bancshares and each of Bancshares' directors and officers are, in compliance

(whether formal or informal), including without limitation any voluntary

outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with
respect to any of the Cornerstone Securities Filings. Bancshares has made
available to the SmartFinancial Parties true, correct, and complete copies of
all material correspondence since June 30, 2011, between the SEC, on the one
hand, and Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

  



  

(iii) Neither Bancshares nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, or any similar Contract (including any
Contract relating to any transaction, arrangement, or relationship between or
among Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose,
or limited purpose Person, on the other hand (such as any arrangement
described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act))
where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries in
Bancshares' consolidated financial statements.

(i) _Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

  



  

(i) The financial statements of the Cornerstone Parties included in
the Cornerstone Securities Filings since June 30, 2011 (including
related notes, where applicable) (A) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Bancshares and its
Subsidiaries, (B) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows, and
the consolidated financial position, of Bancshares and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount), (C) complied as to form, as of their respective
dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, and (D) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as indicated in such
statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Bancshares and
its Subsidiaries have been and are being maintained in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Mauldin and Jenkins, LLC has
not resigned (or informed Bancshares or Cornerstone that it intends to resign)
or been dismissed as the independent public accountants of Bancshares as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Bancshares on a matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(ii) The records, systems, controls, data, and information of
Bancshares and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained, and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical, or photographic
process, whether or not computerized) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of Bancshares or its Subsidiaries or their respective
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for
any instances of non-exclusive ownership or non-direct control that could not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Bancshares Material Adverse Effect. Bancshares (A) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to
Bancshares, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of
Bancshares to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Section 302 and
Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (B) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Bancshares' outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of
directors of Bancshares (1) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Bancshares' ability to record,
process, summarize, and report financial information, and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Bancshares' internal controls over financial reporting.
To the Knowledge of the Cornerstone Parties, there is no reason to believe
that Bancshares' chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, without qualification, when next due.

  



  

(iii) Since June 30, 2011, (A) neither Bancshares nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Cornerstone Parties any
director, officer, auditor, accountant, or other representative of Bancshares
or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion, or claim, whether written
or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies, or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserve write-
downs, charge-offs, and accruals) of Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint,
allegation, assertion, or claim that Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no
attorney representing Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to the board
of directors of Bancshares or any committee thereof, or to any director or
officer of Bancshares, evidence of a material violation of federal or state
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty, or any similar violation or breach
by Bancshares or any of its officers, directors, employees, or agents.

other than (i) debts, liabilities, and obligations reflected on or reserved
against in the Interim Bancshares Financials and (ii) debts, liabilities, and
obligations incurred since September 30, 2014, in the ordinary course of

Bancshares and Cornerstone and their Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses only in the ordinary and usual course consistent

have a Bancshares Material Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2014, neither
Bancshares nor Cornerstone, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has taken or
permitted, or entered into any Contract with respect to, or otherwise agreed

or affecting Bancshares or Cornerstone or any of their Subsidiaries or any
property, asset, right, or interest of Bancshares or Cornerstone or any of
their Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of the Cornerstone Parties,
there are no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such suit, action, claim, investigation, or legal,
administrative, arbitration, or other proceeding. Neither Bancshares or
Cornerstone nor any of their Subsidiaries, nor any of the properties or
assets of Bancshares or Cornerstone or any of their Subsidiaries, is a party

_Schedule 4.2(m)_ of the Cornerstone Disclosure Memorandum, since June 30,
2011, neither Bancshares nor Cornerstone, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has
been a party to any cease and desist order, written agreement, or memorandum
of understanding issued by or with, or any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or has been subject to any action, proceeding, order, or
directive by, any Governmental Entity, or has adopted any board
resolutions at the request of any Governmental Entity, or has been advised by
any Governmental Entity that such Governmental Entity is
contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of
issuing or requesting) any such action, proceeding, order, directive, cease
and desist order, written agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment
letter, board resolutions, or similar undertaking. To the Knowledge of the
Cornerstone Parties, there are no facts or circumstances which could
reasonably be expected to result in any Governmental Entity issuing or
requesting any such action, proceeding, order, directive, cease and desist
order, written agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter,
board resolutions, or similar undertaking. There are no material unresolved
violations, criticisms, or exceptions noted by any Governmental Entity in or
with respect to any report or statement relating to any examination or

Subsidiaries currently are the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Cornerstone Returns. All of the Cornerstone Returns are
true, correct, and complete, and all Taxes due and payable by the Cornerstone
Parties and their Subsidiaries with respect to the periods covered by such
Cornerstone Returns have been paid. The accruals and reserves for Taxes
reflected in the Interim Bancshares Financials are adequate, in
accordance with GAAP, to cover all unpaid Taxes of Bancshares and its
Subsidiaries for periods ending on or prior to the date(s) of the
Interim Bancshares Financials, and all such accruals and reserves for Taxes,
as adjusted for operations and transactions and the passage of time for
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with past custom
and practice of Bancshares and its Subsidiaries, are adequate, in accordance
with GAAP, to cover all unpaid Taxes of Bancshares and its Subsidiaries
accruing through the Closing Date. No claim (whether formal or informal) has
ever been made against the Cornerstone Parties or any of their Subsidiaries
by an authority in a jurisdiction where Bancshares or Cornerstone or their
Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that Bancshares or Cornerstone or any of
their Subsidiaries are or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. No
outstanding agreement, arrangement, extension, or waiver of or with respect
to the limitation period applicable to any Cornerstone Return has been agreed
or entered into or granted (by the Cornerstone Parties or any other Person),

proper taxing authorities. All Taxes that the Cornerstone Parties or any of
their Subsidiaries are or were required to withhold or collect in connection
with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, director, manager, independent

of their Subsidiaries and any such Taxes due as a result of a plan intended
to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" under Section 409A(d)(1) of

Cornerstone Disclosure Memorandum is a true, correct, and complete list of
all Cornerstone Returns filed by or with respect to the Cornerstone Parties or
any of their Subsidiaries during the past five years.

  



  

(iv) No audit, investigation, examination, deficiency assessment,
refund litigation, or other proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Cornerstone Parties, threatened against or with respect to the Cornerstone
Parties or any of their Subsidiaries in respect of any Taxes or Tax matters,
and to the Knowledge of the Cornerstone Parties there are no facts or
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
audit, investigation, examination, deficiency assessment, refund litigation,
or other proceeding. There are no unsatisfied debts, liabilities, or
obligations for Taxes with respect to any notice of deficiency or similar
document received by the Cornerstone Parties or any of their Subsidiaries
with respect to any Taxes. No deficiencies have been asserted against the
Cornerstone Parties or any of their Subsidiaries as a result of an examination
by a taxing authority and no issue has been raised by any examination
conducted by any taxing authority that, by application of the same principles,
might result in a proposed deficiency for any other period not so examined.

Cornerstone Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, other than statutory Liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable for which adequate reserves have

(vi) There is no Contract or plan (including without limitation this
Agreement and the arrangements contemplated hereby) covering any employee or

(ii) There is no pending, threatened, or suspected claim, litigation,
action, administrative action, suit, audit, arbitration, mediation, or other
proceeding relating to any Cornerstone Benefit Plan. All of the Cornerstone

maintained, and administered in compliance, in all material respects, with all
applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws and
the terms and provisions of all documents, contracts, or agreements
establishing the Cornerstone Benefit Plans or pursuant to which they are

of the Code) with respect to any Cornerstone Benefit Plan that is likely to
result in, or has already resulted in, the imposition of any penalties or
Taxes upon Bancshares or Cornerstone, or any of their Subsidiaries, under
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

  



  

(iii) No liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has
been, or is expected by the Cornerstone Parties or their Subsidiaries to be,
incurred with respect to any Cornerstone Benefit Plan that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA (a " _Cornerstone Pension Plan_ "), or with respect to any
"single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or
formerly maintained by Bancshares or Cornerstone or any ERISA Affiliate. No
Cornerstone Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined
in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end
of the most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof; the fair market
value of the assets of each Cornerstone Pension Plan exceeds the present
value of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA) under such Cornerstone Pension Plan as of the end of the most recent
plan year ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such
Cornerstone Pension Plan as of the date hereof; and no notice of a
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to be filed for
any Cornerstone Pension Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date
hereof. Neither Bancshares nor Cornerstone, nor any of their Subsidiaries,
has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Cornerstone Pension
Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code. Neither Bancshares nor Cornerstone, nor any of their
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, has contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

  



  

(iv) Each Cornerstone Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a " _Cornerstone Qualified
Plan_ ") has received a current favorable determination letter from the IRS
(or, in the case of an IRS pre-approved plan, the pre-approved plan has a
current IRS opinion or advisory letter upon which the Cornerstone Parties are
entitled to rely under applicable IRS guidance), and to the Knowledge of the
Cornerstone Parties there are no facts or circumstances that could result in
the revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Each Cornerstone
Qualified Plan that is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) has satisfied all of the applicable
requirements of Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder in all material respects, and any assets of any such Cornerstone
Qualified Plan that, as of the end of the most recent plan year, are not
allocated to participants' individual accounts are pledged as security for,
and may be applied to satisfy, any securities acquisition indebtedness.

(v) Neither Bancshares nor Cornerstone, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, has any obligations for post-retirement or post-employment
benefits under any Cornerstone Benefit Plan that cannot be amended or

Cornerstone Benefit Plan have been or are being processed for payment or

time frames followed by the Cornerstone Benefit Plan and as required by ERISA.
No unfunded Cornerstone Benefit Plan is delinquent in the payment of

applicable Law with respect to each Cornerstone Benefit Plan. All required Tax
filings with respect to each Cornerstone Benefit Plan have been made, and any

filed or been required to file with the IRS a Form 8928 in order to self-
report any health plan violations which are subject to excise taxes under
applicable provisions of the Code, and to the Knowledge of the Cornerstone
Parties there are no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected
to result in Bancshares or Cornerstone, or any of their Subsidiaries, being
required by the Code to file any such Form 8928.

Interim SmartFinancial Financials, and all such accruals and reserves
for Taxes, as adjusted for operations and transactions and the passage of

past custom and practice of SmartFinancial and its Subsidiaries, are adequate,
in accordance with GAAP, to cover all unpaid Taxes of SmartFinancial and its
Subsidiaries accruing through the Closing Date. No claim (whether formal or
informal) has ever been made against the SmartFinancial Parties or any of
their Subsidiaries by an authority in a jurisdiction where SmartFinancial or
SmartBank or their Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that SmartFinancial or
SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries are or may be subject to taxation in
that jurisdiction. No outstanding agreement, arrangement, extension, or waiver
of or with respect to the limitation period applicable to any SmartFinancial

any of their Subsidiaries and any such Taxes due as a result of a plan
intended to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" under Section

SmartFinancial Disclosure Memorandum is a true, correct, and complete list of
all SmartFinancial Returns filed by or with respect to the SmartFinancial
Parties or any of their Subsidiaries during the past five years.

  



  

(iv) No audit, investigation, examination, deficiency assessment,
refund litigation, or other proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
SmartFinancial Parties, threatened against or with respect to the
SmartFinancial Parties or any of their Subsidiaries in respect of any Taxes
or Tax matters, and to the Knowledge of the SmartFinancial Parties there are
no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such audit, investigation, examination, deficiency assessment, refund
litigation, or other proceeding. There are no unsatisfied debts, liabilities,
or obligations for Taxes with respect to any notice of deficiency or similar
document received by the SmartFinancial Parties or any of their Subsidiaries
with respect to any Taxes. No deficiencies have been asserted against the
SmartFinancial Parties or any of their Subsidiaries as a result of an
examination by a taxing authority and no issue has been raised by any
examination conducted by any taxing authority that, by application of the same
principles, might result in a proposed deficiency for any other period not so
examined. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any of the properties or assets
of the SmartFinancial Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, other than
statutory Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable for which adequate
reserves have been established.

(vi) There is no Contract or plan (including without limitation this
Agreement and the arrangements contemplated hereby) covering any employee or
independent contractor, or any former employee or independent contractor, of
SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries that, individually
or collectively with any other such Contracts or Plans, will, or could be
expected to, (A) give rise, directly or indirectly, to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G or Section 162 of
the Code (as determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code),
except those payments that will not be made in the absence of shareholder
approval in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, or (B) subject any such Person to additional taxes under Section 409A
of the Code. Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their

obligation (current or contingent), to compensate any Person for Tax-
related payments, including Taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code
and Taxes under Section 409A of the Code. All disqualified individuals (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with respect to SmartFinancial and

(viii) The SmartFinancial Parties and their Subsidiaries are, and have
at all times been, in compliance with the provisions of Section 6011, Section
6111, and Section 6112 of the Code relating to tax shelter disclosure,
registration, list maintenance, and record keeping, and with the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including any predecessor or successor Code provisions
or Treasury Regulations, as applicable), and neither the SmartFinancial
Parties nor their Subsidiaries have at any time engaged in or entered into (A)
any transaction that would be defined as a "reportable transaction" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b), (B) any confidential
corporate tax shelter within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6111-2, or (C) any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011, Section 301.6111, or Section 301.6112, or any
transaction that would have been such a "listed transaction" if current Law
was in effect at the time the transaction was entered into. No IRS Form 8886
has been filed with respect to the SmartFinancial Parties or any of their
Subsidiaries. Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, has entered into any tax shelter or listed transaction with the
sole or dominant purpose of the avoidance or reduction of a Tax liability in
a jurisdiction outside the United States with respect to which there is a
significant risk of challenge of such transaction by a Governmental Entity in

against SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries that

the Knowledge of the SmartFinancial Parties, has any such proceeding been
threatened, nor is there any strike, labor dispute, or organizational effort
involving SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of their Subsidiaries, pending

related thereto, which are or have been maintained by, contributed to (or
required to be contributed to), or sponsored by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or
an ERISA Affiliate with respect to any present or former directors, officers,
or employees of SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries
(herein referred to collectively as the " _SmartFinancial Benefit Plans_ "),
including any and all plans or policies offered to employees of
SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of their Subsidiaries, with respect to
which SmartFinancial or SmartBank or an ERISA Affiliate has claimed or is
claiming the safe harbor for "voluntary plans" under ERISA for group and
group-type insurance arrangements (" _SmartFinancial Voluntary Plans_ "). The
SmartFinancial Parties have previously delivered or made available to the
Cornerstone Parties true, correct, and complete copies of all plans,
contracts, agreements, arrangements, and other documents referenced in
_Schedule 5.2(s)(i)_ of the SmartFinancial Disclosure Memorandum, along
with, where applicable, copies of the IRS Form 5500 for the most recently
completed year. There has been no announcement or commitment by
SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of their Subsidiaries, to create any
additional SmartFinancial Benefit Plan, to amend any SmartFinancial Benefit
Plan (except for amendments required by applicable Law which do not materially
increase the cost of such SmartFinancial Benefit Plan), or to terminate any
SmartFinancial Benefit Plan. Each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that provides
for the payment of "deferred compensation," including any employment agreement
between SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of their Subsidiaries, and any
employee, complies in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(ii) There is no pending, threatened, or suspected claim, litigation,
action, administrative action, suit, audit, arbitration, mediation, or other
proceeding relating to any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan. All of the
SmartFinancial Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with applicable
requirements of ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws (including
without limitation the portability, privacy, and security provisions of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009; the coverage continuation
requirements of Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985; the Family and Medical Leave Act; the Mental Health Parity Act of
1996; the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008; the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act; the Newborns' and
Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996; the Women's Health and Cancer Rights
Act; and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008), and
have been established, maintained, and administered in compliance, in all
material respects, with all applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and
other applicable Laws and the terms and provisions of all documents,
contracts, or agreements establishing the SmartFinancial Benefit Plans or
pursuant to which they are maintained or administered. No audit of any
SmartFinancial Benefit Plan by the IRS or the United States Department of
Labor is ongoing or threatened or was ongoing, threatened, or closed since
June 30, 2011. There has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any
SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is likely to result in, or has already
resulted in, the imposition of any penalties or Taxes upon SmartFinancial or
SmartBank, or any of their Subsidiaries, under Section 502(i) of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code.

(iii) No liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has
been, or is expected by the SmartFinancial Parties or their Subsidiaries to
be, incurred with respect to any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA (a " _SmartFinancial Pension Plan_ "), or with respect
to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of
ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any
ERISA Affiliate. No SmartFinancial Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of
the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the date
hereof; the fair market value of the assets of each SmartFinancial Pension
Plan exceeds the present value of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such SmartFinancial Pension Plan as of
the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof,
calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent
actuarial valuation for such SmartFinancial Pension Plan as of the date
hereof; and no notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has
been required to be filed for any SmartFinancial Pension Plan within the
12-month period ending on the date hereof. Neither SmartFinancial nor
SmartBank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has provided, or is required to
provide, security to any SmartFinancial Pension Plan or to any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code. Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate, has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to
any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

  



  

(iv) Each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a " _SmartFinancial Qualified
Plan_ ") has received a current favorable determination letter from the IRS
(or, in the case of an IRS pre-approved plan, the pre-approved plan has a
current IRS opinion or advisory letter upon which the SmartFinancial Parties
are entitled to rely under applicable IRS guidance), and to the Knowledge of
the SmartFinancial Parties there are no facts or circumstances that could
result in the revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Each
SmartFinancial Qualified Plan that is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as
defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) has satisfied all of the applicable
requirements of Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder in all material respects, and any assets of any such SmartFinancial
Qualified Plan that, as of the end of the most recent plan year, are not
allocated to participants' individual accounts are pledged as security for,
and may be applied to satisfy, any securities acquisition indebtedness.

  



  

(v) Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, has any obligations for post-retirement or post-employment
benefits under any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that cannot be amended or
terminated upon 60 days or less notice without incurring any liability
thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4980B of the Code or similar state Laws, the cost of which is borne
by the insured individuals.

  



  

(vi) All contributions and payments (both employer and employee)
required to be made with respect to any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan
by applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking,
and all premiums due or payable (both employer and employee) with respect to
insurance policies funding any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full by the
applicable due date, with extensions, or to the extent not required to be made
or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected or reserved
against in the Interim SmartFinancial Financials to the extent required by
GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements. Each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan
that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either
(A) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare
benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (B) is
unfunded. Any unfunded SmartFinancial Benefit Plan pays benefits solely from
the general assets of SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or their applicable
Subsidiary, for which arrangement the establishment of a trust under ERISA is
not required. All unfunded benefits for which claims have been filed under a
SmartFinancial Benefit Plan have been or are being processed for payment or
otherwise adjudicated in accordance with the terms of the
applicable SmartFinancial Benefit Plan and paid (to the extent payment is
due), or will be paid, within the customary, normal, and routine claims
processing and payment time frames followed by the SmartFinancial Benefit Plan
and as required by ERISA. No unfunded SmartFinancial Benefit Plan is
delinquent in the payment of benefits, and neither SmartFinancial nor
SmartBank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, is delinquent in making its
required contributions to any such unfunded SmartFinancial Benefit Plan so
that the SmartFinancial Benefit Plan can pay benefits on a timely basis.

(vii) All required reports, notice, disclosures, and descriptions
(including without limitation Form 5500 annual reports and
required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1, and
summary plan descriptions) have been filed or distributed in accordance with
applicable Law with respect to each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan. All required
Tax filings with respect to each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan have been made,
and any Taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid. Since June
30, 2011, neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, has filed or been required to file with the IRS a Form 8928 in
order to self-report any health plan violations which are subject to excise
taxes under applicable provisions of the Code, and to the Knowledge of the
SmartFinancial Parties there are no facts or circumstances that could
reasonably be expected to result in SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of
their Subsidiaries, being required by the Code to file any such Form 8928.

  



  

(viii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.2(s)(viii)_ of the
SmartFinancial Disclosure Memorandum, neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank,
nor any of their Subsidiaries, is a party to or bound by any Contract
(including without limitation any severance, change of control, or employment
agreement) that will, as a result or consequence of the execution or delivery
of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the consummation of the transactions, including the
Merger, contemplated hereby, either alone or in connection with any other
event, (A) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee, or
independent contractor of SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or of any of their
Subsidiaries, to severance pay or change of control or other benefits, or any
increase in severance pay or other benefits, upon any termination of
employment or of such Contract after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable under, or trigger any withdrawal liability under or any other
material obligation pursuant to, any of the SmartFinancial Benefit Plans, (C)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the
SmartFinancial Benefit Plans, or (D) result in the payment of any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(ix) Persons being provided coverage in or under each SmartFinancial

(including attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, and liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding, or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring prior to the

Effective Time, and based on or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a
director, officer, or employee of SmartFinancial or was serving at the request
of SmartFinancial as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee, or
partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture,
employee benefit plan, or other entity, to the fullest extent such
Indemnified Party would have been entitled to be so indemnified and

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 7.11_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding, or investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation
of the same; _provided_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does
not actually and materially prejudice the Surviving Corporation. In the event
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified

the Indemnified Party advises the Surviving Corporation that there are legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in
addition to those available to the Surviving Corporation or that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Party that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Party may retain its own legal counsel and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay, as statements therefor are received, the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party (which may not
exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless there are multiple Indemnified
Parties who have conflicts of interest), (ii) the Indemnified Party will
cooperate in the defense thereof, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed,
and (iv) the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

and no costs or expenses shall be reimbursable, by either the
SmartFinancial Parties or the Cornerstone Parties in the event this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, _Section 9.1(c)_,  _Section
