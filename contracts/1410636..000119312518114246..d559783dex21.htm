Buyer Parent hereby unconditionally, irrevocably, and absolutely guarantees to Seller the full and timely performance of Buyer&#146;s obligations (including the due and punctual payment of the Purchase Price) pursuant to this Agreement (the
&#147;<B>Obligations</B>&#148;).&nbsp;The guarantee under this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;10.15</U> is a guarantee of performance and not merely of collection, and Buyer Parent&#146;s obligations under this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;10.15</U>
are primary obligations and not those of a mere surety.&nbsp;Upon default with respect to any Obligations, Seller will have no obligation to proceed against Buyer, and may proceed directly against Buyer Parent without first proceeding against Buyer
or any other Person or pursuing any other remedy.&nbsp;Buyer Parent will reimburse Seller for all documented <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> costs and expenses (including court and

stay or ruling thereunder.&nbsp;If all or any part of any payment to or for the benefit of Seller in respect of an Obligation is invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required for any reason to be repaid or paid to a
trustee, receiver or other third Person, the Obligations that otherwise would have been satisfied by that payment or partial payment will be revived and will continue in full force and effect as if that payment had not been made.&nbsp;Buyer may,
without notice to Buyer Parent, extend or alter, together with Seller, the time, manner, place or terms of payment or performance of the Obligations, waive or (together with Seller) amend any terms of this Agreement, or otherwise exercise its rights
hereunder without in any way changing, releasing, or discharging Buyer Parent from liability under this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;10.15</U>.&nbsp;Buyer Parent waives notice of acceptance, presentment, demand, protest, and notices of protest,
