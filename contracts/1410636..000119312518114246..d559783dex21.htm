Section 2.03 _Closing Working Capital_.

 

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will deliver to Buyer a certificate setting forth the Companys good faith
estimate of Closing Working Capital calculated in accordance with this
Agreement and the Accounting Policies ("Estimated Closing Working Capital"),
together with reasonable documentation evidencing such calculation. If Buyer
disagrees in good faith with the calculation of Estimated Closing Working
Capital, Seller will in good faith negotiate a resolution of such
disagreement, _provided_ that if Buyer and Seller fail to reach a resolution
prior to the Closing, Sellers calculation of Estimated Closing Working
Capital will be used for purposes of determining the Purchase Price to be paid
by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_; _provided_   _further_ that in
no event will the consummation of the Closing be construed as a waiver by
Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days, after the
Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller (i) a
certificate setting forth Buyers calculations of Closing Working Capital and
(ii) a statement setting forth (x) the differences between the certificate
delivered by Buyer pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence and the
certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ and
(y) a description, accompanied by supporting documentation, of the basis for
such differences. The Closing Working Capital will (i) fairly present the
Working Capital of the Company as of 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date
that is the last day prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the
Accounting Policies, and (ii) only include line items set forth in  _Exhibit
A_. Buyer will, and will cause the Company to, (x) provide Seller and its
representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior written notice
by Seller, during normal business hours to the books, records (including
work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data and
employees of the Company to the extent related to the certificate and
statement delivered by Buyer

 



10  pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ for purposes of Sellers review of
the certificate and statement delivered by Buyer pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 2.03(b)_ and (y) reasonably cooperate with Seller and its
representatives in connection with such review.

 

(c) Seller and its accountants will have 60 days after delivery of the
certificate and statement referred to in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _
2.03(b)_ to review such documents; _provided_ that if, during such 60-day
period, Buyer or the Company fails to furnish or provide access to
any documents or information requested by Seller for purposes of Sellers
review (to the extent required to be provided or furnished pursuant to clause
(x) of the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_) within five
Business Days of Sellers written request therefor, such 60-day period will
be extended by the number of days between the date of Sellers written request
and the date on which Buyer or the Company furnishes or provides access to
such documents or information to Seller or its representatives. If Seller
disagrees with Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, Seller may, within 60 days after
delivery of such calculation (as such period may be extended pursuant to the
preceding sentence), deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such
calculation and specifying Sellers calculation of such amounts and, in
reasonable detail, Sellers grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of
disagreement will specify those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees,
and Seller will be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the calculations of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_.

(d) If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.03(c)_, Buyer and Seller will, during the 15 days following such delivery
(as such period may be extended pursuant to a written agreement between Buyer
and Seller), use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amounts of Closing Working Capital; _provided_ that such amount of Closing
Working Capital will not be less than the amount thereof shown in Buyers
calculations delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ or more than the
amount thereof shown in Sellers calculations delivered pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such
agreement during such period, they will promptly cause a mutually agreed
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the
"Accounting Firm") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital. In making such
calculations, the Accounting Firm will (i) act as an arbitrator, not as an
expert, (ii) consider only those items or amounts in Buyers calculations of
Closing Working Capital as to which Seller has disagreed and (iii) not
consider or review any settlement (or similar) offers made by Buyer or Seller
in connection herewith. The Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Seller,
as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculations,
including an explanation for its determination of the amount of each disputed
item or amount determined therein. Such report will be final and binding upon
Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review and report will be borne equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand. Neither Buyer nor
Seller will have, directly or indirectly, any ex parte communications or
meetings with the Accounting Firm concerning matters within the scope of its
engagement. Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants 

 



11  and the Company to, cooperate and assist in the calculations of Closing
Working Capital and in the conduct of any reviews referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_, including making available to the extent necessary
books, records, work papers and personnel.

(e) Neither  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ nor _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ is intended
to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that may be found with respect to
the Balance Sheet or any inconsistencies between the Balance Sheet or
the Accounting Policies, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other, for which
the RandW Insurance Policy will be the sole and exclusive remedy, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_.

 

Section 2.04 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, means the
Final Working Capital  _minus_ Estimated Closing Working Capital. If the
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price will be
increased by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, the Purchase Price will be decreased by the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount will be paid in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.04(c)_, as applicable.

 

(b) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of
such amount, the "Deficit Amount"), then within five Business Days after the
determination of Final Working Capital, Seller will pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Buyer, an
amount equal to the Deficit Amount. 

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number (the "Increase Amount"),
then within five Business Days after the determination of Final Working
Capital, Buyer will pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified by Seller, an amount equal to the Increase
Amount.

 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is zero, there will be no adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 

(e) "Final Working Capital" means Closing Working Capital, (x) as shown in
Buyers calculations delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, if no
notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_; or (y) if such a notice of disagreement is duly
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, (A) as agreed by Buyer and
Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(d)_ or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Accounting Firms calculations delivered pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(d)_; _provided_ that, in no event will Final Working
Capital be less than Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ or greater than Sellers calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_.

 

(f) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ will be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, including for
Tax purposes, except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



12 Section 2.05 _Withholding_. Buyer will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the payment of the Purchase Price and any other payment required to be
made by Buyer hereunder such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to any such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that Buyer withholds such
amounts with respect to any Person, Buyer will timely remit such withheld
amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with
Applicable Law and such withheld and remitted amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to or on behalf of such Person.
Buyer will (x) promptly (and, in all cases, not less than five Business Days
before the applicable payment is to be made) notify Seller in writing if Buyer
determines that any withholding or deduction is required under the Code or any
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law with respect to any portion of
such payment and (y) provide Seller with a reasonable opportunity to provide
such forms, certificates or other evidence, and reasonably cooperate
with Seller, to eliminate or reduce any such required deduction or
withholding.

will give Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, on reasonable notice and during
regular business hours, to the offices, properties, books and records of the
Company and appropriate officers and employees of the Company with the
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) in
connection with effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements (including any such access as may be necessary or
appropriate (i) to facilitate the implementation of any transition services
to be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, and (ii) for
Buyer to discuss potential retention arrangements with individual employees),
and such access will not, in any case, include any invasive sampling or
testing; _provided_ that any requests for such access will be directed to
Seller or such other Person as Seller may designate in writing from time to
time. Any activities undertaken by Buyer and its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives in connection with the access
given by Seller and the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ will
be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the Company. No investigation will be permitted to the
extent it would require the Company to disclose (x) information subject to
confidentiality obligations or attorney-client privilege or (y) prior to the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension
thereof) under the HSR Act, any information restricted only to a clean team to
any individual who is not a member of Buyers clean team in accordance with
the applicable terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Buyer will not
have access to personnel records of the Company relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other personal
information of such individuals, in each case to the extent the disclosure
thereof by Seller is prohibited by Applicable Law; _provided_ that Seller, the
Company and Buyer will cooperate to provide Buyer with access to personnel
records, including through executing any nondisclosure, business associate
or other similar agreements. Neither the Company nor Seller makes any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information (if any) provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

 



35 (c) Prior to the Closing, Seller or the Company will deliver, or

of the data room prepared by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.03 _Resignations_. The Company will deliver to Buyer the
resignations of all officers and directors of the Company who will be
officers, directors or employees of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller after
the Closing Date from their positions with the Company at or prior to the
Closing Date.

 

Section 6.04 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that the information made available to it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is
subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between Buyer and
Southern Company Gas, dated February 7, 2018, as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which will
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the
Closing, and the Confidentiality Agreement will automatically terminate
effective as of the Closing. The Confidentiality Agreement will survive any
termination of this Agreement.

(b) For a period of five years following the Closing, Seller will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, keep strictly confidential and not disclose to
any Person (other than employees and representatives of Buyer) any nonpublic
information regarding the Company and its businesses which such Persons
possess, it being agreed that information will not be considered nonpublic,
and Seller and its Affiliates will have no obligation to keep the same
confidential, if (i) such information is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of an act or omission by Seller or its
Affiliates, (ii) Seller or any of its Affiliates received such information on
a non-confidential basis from a Person not known to be subject to
confidentiality obligations in respect thereof, (iii) such information is
required to be disclosed by Seller or any of its Affiliates under Applicable
Law and no suitable protective order or equivalent remedy is available or can
reasonably be obtained, or (iv) such information is or was independently
developed by Seller or its Affiliates not in violation of this _Section_ __ _
6.04_.

 

Section 6.05 _Post-Closing Access_. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer
will, upon reasonable prior notice by Seller, cause the Company to promptly
afford to Seller and its agents reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the properties, books of account, financial and other records
(including accountants work papers), information, employees and auditors of
the Company to the extent necessary or useful for Seller in connection with
any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or any other reasonable
business purpose relating to the Company other than any dispute arising out
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that any such
access by Seller will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and in no event will Buyer or the Company or any of
their Affiliates be required to provide access to or disclose to Seller or its
agents any information to the extent the access by or disclosure to Seller or
its agents thereof would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege or violate any

 



36  obligations of confidentiality to which Buyer or the Company or such
Affiliate is subject. Seller will bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees, but excluding reimbursement for general
overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection
with the foregoing.

Section 6.06 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Buyers representatives will contact and communicate with
the employees, customers, resellers, vendors, suppliers and other business
relations (other than potential financing sources) of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law and with the prior written consent of the
Company and Seller.

 

Section 6.07 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
will, or will cause Company to, provide Buyer with an updated Employee
Schedule disclosing the updated list of the Company Employees and Transferring
Employees in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.17(a)_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller will cause the employment of each employee of the Seller or an
Affiliate whose work responsibilities exclusively relate to the business of
the Company and is identified on the Employee Schedule, to be transferred to
the Company (each, a "Transferring Employee"), and Seller will ensure that no
other employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than Company
Employees) are employed by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) from
and after the Closing Date, each Transferring Employee employed by
the Company as of the Closing will constitute a Company Employee for purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ and (ii) no Excluded Employee will be a Company
Employee.

 

(b) As of the Closing Date, Buyer will provide or offer, or will cause its
Affiliates to provide or offer, each Company Employee, while such Company
Employee is employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including the
Company), (i) for a period beginning on the Closing Date and expiring at the
end of the first full calendar year following the year in which the Closing
occurs, with (A) a base salary or wage rate and commission opportunities for
call center personnel (but not bonus opportunities) that are no less favorable
than the base salary or wage rate and commission opportunities for call
center personnel provided by the Company or any of Sellers Affiliates to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (B) other
employee benefits (excluding severance benefits, bonus opportunities, equity-
based compensation, defined benefit plan and retiree health and welfare and
life insurance benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefits offered to such Company Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date, and (ii) for a period of 12 months beginning on the Closing
Date, with a bonus opportunity and severance benefits under a severance plan
or arrangement that are no less favorable than the bonus opportunity and
severance benefits under a severance plan or arrangement provided by the
Company or any of Sellers Affiliates to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

 



37 (c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or
its Affiliates in which any Company Employee becomes a participant, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation, paid
time-off, severance plan and the Buyer 401(k) Plan, each Company Employees
service with the Company or any of its Affiliates (as well as service with any
predecessor employer, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is
recognized by the Company or any of its Affiliates) will be treated
as service with Buyer and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits, where such service was not recognized
under a comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing, or where
prior service is not recognized for similarly-situated employees of Buyer and
its Affiliates.

 

(d) Seller will fully vest all Company Employees in their account balances
under the retirement savings plan in which such Company Employees participate
(the "Sellers 401(k) Plan"), effective as of the Closing. Effective as of the
Closing, Buyer will maintain or designate, or cause to be maintained or
designated, a defined contribution plan and related trust intended to be
qualified under Sections 401(a), 401(k), and 501(a) of the Code (the "Buyers
401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the Closing, the Company Employees will cease
participation in Sellers 401(k) Plan. The Company Employees will be eligible
to participate and will commence participation in Buyers 401(k) Plan in
accordance with the terms of Buyers 401(k) Plan. Seller and Buyer will
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) permit each Company
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but excluding any
amounts deferred into a Roth account) to Buyers 401(k) Plan in cash in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Company Employee
from Sellers 401(k) Plan (other than any amounts deferred in a Roth account)
and, (ii) to the extent the applicable Company Employee is making rollover
contributions in accordance with clause (i), permit such rollover
contributions in the form of notes as representing an employee loan under
Sellers 401(k) Plan, and Buyer will take (or cause to be taken) any and all
reasonable actions as may be required to provide that Company Employees may
continue to service any such loans through payroll deductions after the
Closing; _provided_ that, with respect to Company Employee rolling over
employee loans, such rollover will be effected through Seller causing the
trustees of the Sellers 401(k) Plan to transfer to the trustees of the
Buyers 401(k) Plan the amounts representing the account balances and
underlying assets (in cash) and liabilities (including the outstanding loan
balances and excluding any assets relating to Roth accounts) in a manner that
complies with Section 414(l) of the Code and ERISA.

 

(e) Seller will fully vest all Company Employees in their benefits accrued
under The Southern Company Pension Plan (the "Sellers Pension Plan"),
effective as of the Closing. Effective as of the Closing, the Company
Employees will cease participation in Sellers Pension Plan. Seller and Buyer
will cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to permit each Company
Employee who is a Cash Balance Benefit Formula Participant (as that term is
defined in Sellers Pension Plan) to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) to Buyers 401(k) Plan in cash in an amount equal to

 



38  the distributed Cash Balance Account (as that term is defined in Sellers
Pension Plan) from Sellers Pension Plan. All Company Employees participating
in Sellers Pension Plan who are not Cash Balance Benefit Formula
Participants will be treated as terminating service under such plan effective
as of the Closing.

 

(f) Except as expressly accrued for and included in Closing Working Capital
(which, for purposes of clarity, will in no case include any pension or
similar retirement benefits), and except to the extent that Buyer provides a
health flexible spending account benefit to any Company Employee immediately
following the Closing and subject to the last sentence of this  _Section_ __
_ 6.07(f)_, Seller will retain all liability with respect to the Employee
Plans (excluding Company Plans), including the Sellers Pension Plan, all
nonqualified deferred compensation plans, and the Health and Welfare Plan for
Retired and Inactive Employees of Southern Company Gas, in each case with
respect to all current and former Company Employees as well as those employees
of Seller whose work responsibilities related primarily to the business of
the Company, and who retired prior to the Closing. In addition, Seller will
retain all liability with respect to the Excluded Employees, including any
severance payments or benefits paid or provided to the Excluded Employees at
any time. As of the Closing Date, with respect to each Company Employee who
currently participates in an Employee Plan that is a health flexible spending
account plan (the "Seller FSA Plans"), Seller will, or will cause the Company
to, transfer, from the Seller FSA Plans to the applicable health flexible
spending account plan designated by Buyer (the "Buyer FSA Plan") the account
balances (positive or negative) of such Company Employees. Each Company
Employee will be permitted to continue to have payroll deductions made as
most recently elected by him or her under the applicable Seller FSA Plan. As
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but no later than
ten days after the Closing Date, Seller will provide Buyer with a
reconciliation of the underspent and overspent flexible spending accounts of
Company Employees in the Seller FSA Plans. Amounts forfeited by Company
Employees in the Buyer FSA Plan at the end of the plan year during which the
Closing occurs will be assets of Buyer.

(g) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer will provide credit
to each Company Employee for all accrued but unpaid vacation available to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that the
aggregate liability of the Company, Seller and its Affiliates for all
such accrued but unpaid vacation relating to the Company Employees that has
been accrued as of the Closing will be included as a current liability for
purposes of Closing Working Capital. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.07(b)_, on
and after the Closing Date, each Company Employee will be eligible to accrue
additional vacation, sick leave, or personal time off in accordance with the
applicable policies of Buyer or one of its Affiliates (other than the Company)
as in effect from time to time.

(h) As of the Closing, each Company Employee who is a participant in an
annual cash performance pay program of the Company, Seller, or an Affiliate
of Seller (a "PPP") will be eligible to participate in an annual incentive
program maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (an "Incentive Program")
that will provide that (i) with respect to the portion of the Incentive
Program relating to the portion of the year from

 



39  the beginning of the applicable performance period through the Closing Date,
target level under the applicable PPP will be deemed to have been achieved and
(ii) the portion of the Incentive Program relating to the period beginning
after the Closing Date and ending at the end of the applicable performance
period will be based on actual performance, with the bonus opportunity for
Company Employees under the Incentive Program to be at a level that is
substantially the same as similarly situated employees of Buyer and will be
paid at the same time and on the same terms as for other similarly situated
participants in the Incentive Program. The aggregate liability of the
Company, Seller and its Affiliates for awards under the PPP with respect to
the Company Employees under the PPP accrued as of the Closing will be included
as a current liability for purposes of Closing Working Capital.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, with respect
to each Company Employee who is eligible to participate in the Southern
Company Long-Term Incentive Program, as governed by the Southern Company
Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as of the Closing and would be eligible
to receive equity grants pursuant to the terms of Buyers and its Affiliates
2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan and Buyers and its Affiliates Long-
Term Performance Plan ("Buyer Equity Program"), Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to make such Company Employee an annual equity grant
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Buyer Equity Program on
substantially the same terms and timing as annual equity grants under the
Buyer Equity Program made to similarly situated employees of Buyer.

 

(j) As of the Closing, Company Employees will no longer be eligible to
participate in the active health and welfare benefit plans sponsored by
Seller or an Affiliate. Buyer will, to the extent permitted by the applicable
employee benefit plan sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates ("Buyer Plan"), use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or will cause its Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, any preexisting conditions,
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing, except to the extent that such
preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under
the comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing. Subject to
Seller or the Company providing, or causing an Affiliate to provide, Buyer
with accurate data requested by Buyer in a timely manner, and to the extent
permitted by the applicable Buyer Plan, Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize, or will cause its Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by each Company Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) prior to the Closing for purposes of
satisfying any analogous deductible and co-payment limitations and out-of-
pocket requirements under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller
will remain liable for benefits and claims incurred by Company Employees under
its health and welfare benefit plans through the Closing, and Buyer will be
liable for benefits and claims incurred by Company Employees under its health
and welfare plans from and after the Closing.

 



40 (k) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Seller will, or
will cause the Company or an Affiliate of Seller to, provide to Buyer all
Company Employee and Transferring Employee related data reasonably requested
by Buyer prior to the date hereof in order to set up payroll for the Company
Employees and Transferring Employees and otherwise provide employee benefits
to Company Employees and Transferring Employees immediately following the
Closing.

 

(l) Without limiting the generality of the last sentence of _Section_ __ _
10.10_, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, express or implied, is
intended to or will confer upon any other Person, including any current or
former Company Employees, Transferring Employees or any beneficiary thereof
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ will constitute
an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend or an obligation to continue, any
Employee Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained
by Buyer or its Affiliates and any such plan, program or arrangement may be
amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and any Applicable Law.
Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ will create any obligation on the part
of Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, to continue to employ any Company
Employee for any definite period following the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.08 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances;
Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary or desirable under Applicable Law to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking the State
Approvals. Seller and Buyer agree that Seller, prior to the Closing, and
Buyer, after the Closing, will cause the Company to, execute and deliver such
other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such
other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer
and Seller will make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten Business
Days of the date hereof. Each of Buyer and Seller will (i) respond as promptly
as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust
Division for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and
requests received from any state attorney general or other Governmental
Authority in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to

 



41  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior written consent of the other party (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Buyer will offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to
take) with respect to the Company all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may
be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or
any other Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the consummation thereof. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer will agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services,
or assets of the Company; _provided_ that any such action will be conditioned
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) in no event will Buyer or its Affiliates be required to divest, hold
separate or take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services, or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates, and (ii) in no event will
Buyer or its Affiliates be required to, and Seller will not, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, in connection with obtaining the approval of any
Governmental Authority, consent to or take any action that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
effect on the Company.

 

(d) Each party will (i) promptly notify the other party of any written
communication relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or
any other Governmental Authority and, subject to Applicable Law, permit the
other party to review in advance, and consult with and consider in good faith
the views of such other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
any of the foregoing; (ii) to the extent practicable, not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any
competition or antitrust matters in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii)
furnish the other party as promptly as practicable with copies of all
substantive correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their
respective representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory
authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with
respect to any competition or antitrust matters in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the parties
may, as each deems reasonably necessary, designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other party under this _Section_ __ _
6.08_ as "outside counsel only"; _provided_ , _further_ , that materials
provided to the other party or its outside counsel pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.08_ may be redacted to remove references (i) concerning the valuation
of the Company, (ii) as regards Buyers plans for conducting its business or
that of the Company after consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or (iii) information unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



42 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement will require, or be deemed to require, Seller or any of
Sellers Affiliates, to propose, negotiate, offer to commit, effect or agree
to (i) any sale, divestiture, license or disposition of assets or businesses
or (ii) any behavioral remedy; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 6.08(e)_ will not be deemed to prohibit any action
required to be taken with respect to the Company under this  _Section_ __ _
6.08_.

Section 6.09 _Certain Filings; Consents_. Seller and Buyer will cooperate
with one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with or notice to, or consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

Section 6.10 _Public Announcements_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that they have agreed upon the timing of the issuance and filing of,
and their respective forms of, press releases and related filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be issued and filed announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Following the issuance of such
press releases and prior to the Closing, no party hereto will issue, or permit
any of its Affiliates or representatives to issue, any press release or
otherwise make any public statements or announcements regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of the other party, except as otherwise determined to be necessary
or appropriate to comply with Applicable Law or any rules or regulations of
any supervisory, regulatory or other Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over it or any of its Affiliates (including the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange), in which case the party
required to issue such press release or public announcement will use
reasonable efforts to provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such
publication. Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto will consult with each
other and reasonably cooperate concerning the means by which the employees,
customers, and suppliers of the Company and others having dealings with
the Company will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
will limit either partys (or either partys respective Affiliates) rights to
disclose the existence of this Agreement and the general nature of the
transaction described herein on any earnings call or in similar discussions
with financial media or analysts, stockholders and other members of the
investment community.

 



43 Section 6.11 _Intercompany Arrangements_.

(a) All intercompany accounts between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will be settled as of the Closing
(irrespective of the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts) and the
Company will be fully and unconditionally released and discharged from all
liabilities and obligations in connection therewith effective as of no later
than the Closing.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.11(b)_ , each Contract between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, will be terminated at or before the Closing without further liability to
the Company or Buyer.

 

(c) Immediately after the Closing, Buyer will cause the Company, on the one
hand, and Seller will cause its Affiliates identified on _Schedule 6.11(c)_ ,
on the other hand, to enter into the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.11(c)_
in the forms agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 6.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(i) Buyer will, and Parent will cause Tax Parent to, jointly make a timely
and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under any applicable state or local Tax law) with
respect to the acquisition of the Company pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election").

(ii) Parent and Buyer will, and Parent will cause Tax Parent to, cooperate
in the preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to
effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883
and any similar forms under applicable state and local income Tax laws
(collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Forms"). Buyer will, and Parent will
cause Tax Parent to, timely file such Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the
applicable Taxing Authorities. Each of Parent and Buyer agrees that it will
not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates (including in the case of
Parent, Tax Parent) to, revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election following the
filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Forms.

 

(iii) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Buyer will (or will cause their
relevant Affiliates to) agree on the form and content of, and at Closing,
Parent and Buyer will (or will cause their relevant Affiliates to) each
deliver to the other party a duly executed IRS Form 8023 that reflects the
Section 338(h)(10) Election (and, upon prior written request of Buyer
submitted to Seller as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in no
event less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any analogous
form required to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) for state or local
Tax purposes); _provided_ that any such Section 338(h)(10) Form that is
required to reflect the final Purchase Price (determined pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.04_) or Purchase Price Allocation (determined pursuant to 

 



44   _Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_) will be delivered with such portions remaining
blank, and Buyer will complete such portions promptly following, and
reflecting, the final determination of the Purchase Price (pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_) and the Purchase Price Allocation (pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_), and will provide a completed draft of such Section
338(h)(10) Form to Seller for Sellers review prior to filing such Section
338(h)(10) Form.

(iv) For all U.S. federal (and, as applicable state and local) income Tax
purposes, Parent and Buyer agree to (and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates (including in the case of Parent, Tax Parent) to) treat the sale of
the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with Applicable Law,
including Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (the "Transaction Tax
Treatment").

 

(b) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) No later than 120 days after the Purchase Price is finally determined
hereunder pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, Buyer will deliver to Seller a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as adjusted to take into account
any payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_) and other amounts treated
as consideration for federal income (and other applicable) Tax purposes,
which allocation will be consistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment and
will be prepared in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Buyers Draft
Allocation"). If Seller disagrees with Buyers Draft Allocation, Seller may,
within 30 days after delivery of Buyers Draft Allocation, deliver a
notice ("Sellers Allocation Notice") to Buyer to such effect, specifying
those items as to which Seller disagrees and setting forth Sellers proposed
allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts). If Sellers
Allocation Notice is delivered to Buyer within such 30 day period, Seller and
Buyer will, during the 20 days following such delivery, negotiate in good
faith to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts).
If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement within such 20 day
period, then the parties will submit Buyers Draft Allocation and Sellers
Allocation Notice to the Accounting Firm to resolve all disputed items. Buyer
will bear all fees, costs, expenses and other charges payable in connection
with the Accounting Firms services to resolve such disputes. The allocation
of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) as prepared by Buyer (if
no Sellers Allocation Notice has been timely delivered), as adjusted pursuant
to any agreement reached by Seller and Buyer, if any, or as determined by the
Accounting Firm (the "Purchase Price Allocation"), will be conclusive and
binding on all parties. The Purchase Price Allocation will be adjusted, as
necessary, to reflect any subsequent payments treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price under this Agreement.

 

(ii) Parent and Buyer will (and will cause their Affiliates (including in
the case of Parent, Tax Parent) to) (A) prepare and file all Tax Returns
(including

 



45  the Section 338(h)(10) Forms), in a manner consistent with the Transaction
Tax Treatment, the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Purchase Price
Allocation and (B) not take any position inconsistent therewith on any Tax
Return, in connection with any Tax Claim, any Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in
each case, except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law,
including pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of applicable state, local or non-U.S.
Applicable Law).

 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or required by Applicable
Law, the taxable year of the Company that includes the Closing Date will be
treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date. To the extent not
permitted or required by Applicable Law such that there will be a Straddle
Period, for purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period,
(i) Property Taxes of the Company allocable to the Pre-Closing Period will be
equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Company allocable to
the Pre-Closing Period will be computed as if such taxable period ended as of
the end of the day on the Closing Date. Exemptions, allowances or deductions
for any Straddle Period that are calculated on an annual basis will be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period in the same manner as set
forth in the preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Parent or Seller, as applicable, will prepare and timely file or will
cause Tax Parent to prepare and timely file (x) any Consolidated Tax Return,
(y) any Tax Return (other than any Consolidated Tax Return) that is required
to be filed by or with respect to the Company for any taxable period that ends
on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions) (a "Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Return") and (z) any Straddle Period Tax Return or other
Tax Return by or with respect to the Company that is required to be filed on
or before the Closing Date. With respect to any Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Return that is required by Applicable Law to be filed after the Closing Date
by Buyer, (a) Seller will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer any
such Tax Return at least ten days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns (taking into account any extensions) or such shorter period as is
reasonable given the nature of such Tax Return for Buyers review and
comment, (b) Seller will consider in good faith any reasonable comments timely
provided by Buyer in writing not less than five days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions) and (c) Buyer
will timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax Returns. Buyer will
promptly provide (or cause to be provided) to Seller any information
reasonably requested by Seller to facilitate the preparation and filing of any
Tax Returns described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)(i)_.

(ii) Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared by Parent or Seller
(or caused to be prepared by Parent or Seller) pursuant to _Section_

 



46   _6.12(d)(i)_ , Buyer will prepare and timely file and pay or cause to be
prepared and timely filed and paid all Tax Returns with respect to the Company
that is required to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax
Return for a Straddle Period (other than a Straddle Period Tax Return required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date), Buyer will prepare or cause to be
prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practices of the
Company (or of Seller with respect to the Company) except to the extent
required by Applicable Law. Buyer will deliver to Seller for its review,
comment and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of such Straddle Period Tax Returns
at least 15 days prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any
extensions) or such shorter period as is reasonable given the nature of such
Tax Return. Buyer will consider in good faith any reasonable comments
provided by Seller.

(e) _Tax Claims_.

 

(i) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving written notice of such Tax Claim promptly will
provide written notice thereof to the other party; _provided_ , however, that
the failure of such party to give such prompt notice will not relieve the
other party of any of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_,
except to the extent that the other party is prejudiced by such failure. Such
notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and will
include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from
the Taxing Authority. In addition, Buyer agrees to promptly provide to Seller
any notices or written inquiries received from a Taxing Authority that pertain
to a Consolidated Tax Return.

 

(ii) Seller will have the right (but not the obligation) to control
(including the selection of counsel) at its own expense any Tax Proceeding
with respect to the Company for a taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date. Buyer will control (including selection of counsel) (x) at its
own expense any Tax Proceeding with respect to the Company for a Straddle
Period or Post-Closing Period, and, (y) at Sellers expense, any Tax
Proceeding with respect to the Company for a taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date that Seller decides not to control (and conveys its
decision not to so control such Tax Proceeding to Buyer in writing). With
respect to any Tax Proceeding for a taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and is controlled by Buyer, or any Straddle Period, (A) the
controlling party will provide the non-controlling party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (B) the
controlling party will consult with the non-controlling party before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (C) the
controlling party will consult with the non-controlling party before
submitting any significant written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, (D) the controlling party will defend
such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party
in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (E) the non-controlling
party will be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend and
participate in any

 



47  meetings, calls or conferences with the relevant Taxing Authority and (F)
the controlling party will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of the non-controlling
party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would give rise to any
Tax liability or indemnification obligation of the other party pursuant to
this Agreement.

(f) _Consolidated Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (including _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_, _Section_ __ _
6.12(e)_, and _Section_ __ _ 6.12(i)_), (i) in no event will Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer (including, after the Closing, the Company) have any
rights or access to any Consolidated Tax Return or any other consolidated,
affiliated, combined, unitary or other similar group Tax Return that includes
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, (ii) Seller and its Affiliates will have
the exclusive right to control the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns
and (iii) Seller and its Affiliates will have exclusive control over any Tax
Claim or Tax Proceeding relating to any such Tax Return and make all
decisions taken in connection therewith and Buyer will have no right to
participate.

 

(g) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund that is received by the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company after the Closing, and any amount credited against
Tax to which the Company or any Affiliate of the Company becomes entitled
after the Closing, for or with respect to Taxes paid by Seller, an Affiliate
of Seller, or the Company for a Pre-Closing Period, will be for the account of
Seller, except to the extent such refunds or credits were reflected as an
asset in the Final Working Capital, and Buyer will, or will cause its
applicable Affiliate to, pay over to Seller an amount equal to any such
refund or credit, net of any (x) Tax imposed on the receipt of such refund or
credit and (y) reasonable expenses incurred to obtain such refund or credit,
within 15 days after receipt thereof or entitlement thereto. Any refunds or
credits of Taxes of the Company for any Straddle Period will be equitably
apportioned between Seller and Buyer in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.12(c)_. Buyer will cause the Company, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax asset arising in
any Post-Closing Period that could be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period.

 

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On or before the Closing Date, the rights
and obligations of the Company pursuant to all Tax allocation, sharing,
indemnification or similar agreements or arrangements (other than this
Agreement), if any, to which any of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
or any of its Affiliates (including Tax Parent), on the other hand,
are parties, will terminate, and neither Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including Tax Parent), on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand,
will have any rights or obligations to each other after the Closing in respect
of such agreements or arrangements.

(i) _Buyer Tax Acts_. Buyer will not (with respect to the Company), and
will not cause or permit the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer (with respect
to the Company) to, without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i) file any Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Period in a jurisdiction where the Company has not
historically filed Tax Returns, except as

 



48  required pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Applicable
Law) with respect to a Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding controlled by Seller (or
any Affiliate of Seller) or a determination for which prior written notice was
provided by Buyer to Seller, (ii) initiate discussions or examinations
with any Taxing Authority regarding Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period or make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Period, (iii) take any action outside of the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date after the Closing or (iv) amend, revoke, refile
or otherwise modify any Tax Return of or with respect to the Company that
relates to a Pre-Closing Period (except as required pursuant to a
determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Applicable Law) with respect to
a Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding controlled by Seller (or any Affiliate of
Seller) or a determination for which prior written notice was provided by
Buyer to Seller), or make, revoke or modify any Tax election that would be
effective for any Pre-Closing Period (each of (i)-(iv), a "Buyer Tax Act").

 

(j) _Tax Indemnity_.

 

(i) From and after the Closing, Parent and Seller will indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against (without duplication and
to the extent not taken into account in the determination of Final Working
Capital) any liability for Taxes arising out of, relating to or resulting
from: (A) any Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Period, (B) any Taxes of
Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates for which the Company is liable
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or under any similar provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Law), as transferee or successor pursuant to a
transaction or event occurring prior to Closing, or by reason of having been a
member of a consolidated, affiliated, combined or other similar group for Tax
purposes at any time before the Closing, (C) any Taxes (other than Transfer
Taxes) imposed on Parent or any Affiliate thereof (or Buyer as a method of
collecting such Taxes of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent) for the sale of
the Shares pursuant to this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any income Taxes imposed on the deemed asset sale pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d) resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, (D) any breach by Parent or Seller of any covenant in _Section_ __ _
6.12_, (E) any Taxes resulting from any action or inaction of Parent, Seller,
or any of their Affiliates, or from any fact or circumstance in existence on
or before the Closing that is known to, and within the control of, Parent or
any Affiliate of Parent (including Tax Parent), that causes the Section
338(h)(10) Election to be invalid for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Section 338(h)(10) Election is
invalid because Seller is not a member of the affiliated group
of corporations filing a consolidated Tax Return of which Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent is the common parent immediately prior to Closing; but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Section 338(h)(10) Election is
invalid as a result of (x) any action or inaction of Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer (including any such action or inaction of Buyer or its Affiliate that
results in Buyer acquiring stock of the Company possessing less than 80% of
the total voting power of the Company or having value of less than

 



49  80% of the total value of the stock of the Company) or (y) Buyer not being a
corporation, and (F) Sellers portion of Transfer Taxes pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 10.04_. Parents and Sellers obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from any Taxes pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.12(j)(i)_ will survive until 30 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from and against (without duplication) any liability
for Taxes arising out of, relating to or resulting from: (A) any breach by
Buyer of any covenant in  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ (including any Buyer Tax
Act), and (B) Buyers portion of any Straddle Period Taxes and Transfer Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that Buyer will not be required to
indemnify Seller or its Affiliates from and against any liability for Taxes
for which Seller or its Affiliates are responsible under _Section_ __ _
6.12(j)(i)_. Buyers obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates from any Taxes pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(j)(ii)_ will
survive until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

 

(iii) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(j)_ will be made within ten days after the indemnitee
makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, provided that such written
demand includes adequate evidence to substantiate the incurrence and amount
of the Loss for which indemnification was claimed.

(iv) In no event will Buyer or any of its Affiliates have a right to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 6.12(j)(i)_ for any Losses to the extent
such Losses are based on Taxes: (i) that are due to the unavailability in any
Post-Closing Period of any net operating losses or other Tax asset from a
Pre-Closing Period; (ii) resulting from transactions or actions taken by
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing on
the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of business and that are not
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) that result from a breach by Buyer of
any covenant in Section 6.12(d) (Tax Returns), Section 6.12(e) (Tax Claims) or
Section 6.12 (i) (Buyer Tax Acts); or (iv) that result from Buyers failure
to file any Section 338(h)(10) Forms to make a corresponding Section
338(h)(10) Election under any applicable state or local Tax law pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_.

(v) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided by
Seller to Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ will be net of any amounts
actually recovered by Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of such Loss under
insurance policies (including the RandW Insurance Policy), net of expenses
incurred in collecting such amount, including any deductible amount paid by
Buyer and its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer will not be
obligated to pursue a claim for a Loss under the RandW Insurance Policy, and
Buyer may seek payment from Parent or Seller immediately pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(j)(iii)_, with respect to any Taxes due on a Tax Return
filed by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ or with respect to
any Taxes that are excluded from coverage by the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



50 (k) Any payments made pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ will be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, including for
federal income (and other applicable) Tax purposes, except to the extent
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 

(l) Seller and Buyer will cooperate as reasonably requested by the other
party in the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and responding to and
resolving any Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding, in each case relating to Pre-
Closing Period Taxes of the Company, including the furnishing or making
available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably
required), books of account, powers of attorney and other reasonably necessary
materials. Buyer agrees to retain or cause to be retained all books and
records pertinent to the Company (including Tax Returns) until the applicable
period for assessment under Applicable Law (giving effect to any applicable
extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause such abidance
with all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.
Buyer agrees to give (or cause to be given to) Seller reasonable notice prior
to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records relating
to Tax matters and, if Seller so requests, the Company will allow Seller to
take possession of such books and records.

Section 6.13 _Director and Officer Liability_. As of the Closing, Buyer
will cause the Company, and the Company hereby agrees, to do the following:

 

(a) For six years following the Closing, the Company will indemnify and
hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law or provided under the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof.

(b) For six years following the Closing, Buyer will cause to be maintained
in effect provisions in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Company)
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company will or, if the Company is unable to,
Buyer will cause the Company as of the Closing to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Closing with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior
to the Closing from an insurance carrier with an AM Best rating of at least an
A-VII with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Companys existing policies. If the

 



51  Company for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Closing, the Company will continue to maintain in effect, for a period of
at least six years from and after the Closing, the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with an AM Best rating of at least an A-VII with respect to
DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Company will purchase from
the Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with an
AM Best rating of at least an A-VII with respect to DandO Insurance comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no
event will Buyer or the Company be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year; and provided
further that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Company will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing,
for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person or liquidates or winds up, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision will be made so that the successors
and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_.

 

(e) The rights of each Person subject to indemnification under this Section
will be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or under Applicable Law or under
any agreement of any such Person with the Company. These rights will survive
consummation of the Closing and are intended to benefit, and will be
enforceable by, each such Person.

Section 6.14 _No Control of the Company_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the
Closing, the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 

Section 6.15 _Use of Name; Phase Out_. Within 90 days following the
Closing (the "Wind-down Period"), Buyer will, and will cause the Company to,
cease using the Excluded Intellectual Property Rights, including removing
(including by irreversibly covering) the Excluded Intellectual Property Rights
from any properties or assets of the Company that are in the possession or
control of the Company, and Buyer will not, and will cause the Company not to,
use the Excluded Intellectual Property Rights, and Buyer acknowledges that it
and its Affiliates have no rights whatsoever to use the Excluded Intellectual
Property Rights or such related Intellectual Property Rights, except as
provided herein; _provided_ , that following the Wind-down Period, Buyer and
its Affiliates

 



52  (including the Company), and their respective successors and assigns, may
maintain books and records containing the Excluded Intellectual Property
Rights for archival, compliance or other similar purposes. At the Closing, or
as soon as reasonably practicable after (but in any event within two Business
Days after the Closing Date), Buyer will cause the Company to file appropriate
documents with the relevant Governmental Authority removing the word "Nicor"
from its legal name. Notwithstanding Buyers right to use the Excluded
Intellectual Property Rights for the time period set forth above, Buyer agrees
that (a) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will be deemed an agent,
representative or joint venture partner of Seller, (b) Seller and its
Affiliates will retain sole and exclusive ownership of the Excluded
Intellectual Property Rights, and all goodwill and rights related thereto and
(c) Buyer and its Affiliates will not knowingly take any action in respect of
the Excluded Intellectual Property Rights that would adversely affect Seller
or its Affiliates, or the interest of Seller or its Affiliates in the Excluded
Intellectual Property Rights. 

Section 6.16 _FIRPTA_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver
to Buyer a duly completed and executed certification of non-foreign status of
Seller prepared in accordance with Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury
Regulations. 

Section 6.17 _Exclusivity_. From and after the date hereof and until
the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Seller and the Company will not, and will cause
their respective Affiliates and representatives not, directly or indirectly,
to (a) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize,
recommend, propose or enter into, whether as the proposed surviving, merged,
acquiring or acquired corporation or otherwise, any transaction involving a
direct merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition
of the Company (or any portion thereof), the properties or assets of the
Company other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an
"Acquisition Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers with respect
to an Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished to any
Person any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction or (d)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any
of the foregoing with respect to the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_ is intended to restrict or limit Seller
or any of Sellers Affiliates (other than the Company) from entering
into, engaging in or consummating any transaction not involving the Company.
Seller and the Company will, and will cause their respective Affiliates and
representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions
or negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction. Seller agrees, and will cause the
Company and Sellers Affiliates to agree, not to release any third party from
the confidentiality provisions of any agreement to which Seller or the
Company is a party in connection with an Acquisition Transaction.

 



53 Section 6.18 _Restrictive Covenants_.

(a) For a period of two years from and after the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Parent and Seller will not, and will cause their
respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, whether as principal,
agent, partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, consultant or
otherwise, alone or in association with any other Person, own, manage,
operate, control, participate in, invest in, or carry on a Competing Business
Activity within the Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its
Affiliates will not be prohibited from or restricted in any way with respect
to:

(i) holding a passive investment of 5% or less of the outstanding equity
securities and economic interest of any Person that is engaged in a Competing
Business Activity within the Territory;

 

(ii) acquiring an interest in a Person engaged in a Competing Business
Activity (an "Acquired Person") within the Territory, if such Acquired Person
derives less than 15% of its annual revenues from such Competing Business
Activity;

 

(iii) the acquisition or holding of any securities of any Person that is
engaged in a Competing Business Activity within the Territory by any employee
benefit plan of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller solely for financial
investment purposes; or

 

(iv) the indirect passive investment in any Person engaged in a Competing
Business Activity within the Territory by funds in which Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller is invested as a limited partner with less than 20% of the
aggregate capital commitment of such fund.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Parent and Seller will not, and will
cause their Affiliates not to, whether for its or their own account or for
the account of any other Person, solicit, offer employment to or hire any
Company Employee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferring
Employees); _provided_ , that the foregoing will not prohibit (i) any general
advertisements or solicitations of employment by Parent, Seller or any of
their Affiliates or (ii) Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates from hiring
any employee or service provider whose employment or service relationship has
been terminated without cause by the Company.

(c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach,
or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_
may be inadequate and, accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees that Buyer
will, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer may have at
law, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to
the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened
breach of such covenant, as may be available from any court of
competent jurisdiction. In addition, Seller and Buyer agree that the terms of
the covenants in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ are fair and reasonable and are
necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and other intangible
assets contemplated hereby. In the

 



54  event that any of the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ will
be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for
any reason whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions will not be
deemed void, and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by
the court and that said covenant contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ will
be amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed
by the parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be
enforced to the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds
the scope of the covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the
covenant so as to comply with Applicable Law.

 

Section 6.19 _Insurance Matters_. Seller will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates in
connection with obtaining, for the benefit of the Company and at Buyers sole
cost and expense, one or more run-off or "tail" insurance policies to provide
insurance coverage for the Company following the Closing under insurance
policies of Seller or its Affiliates which cover the Company or any of its
assets or properties as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.20 _Misallocated Assets; Payments_.

 

(a) If, following the Closing, Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates discovers that, through inadvertence, mistake or otherwise, any
assets, properties or rights (including Intellectual Property Rights) of the
Company that were used exclusively by the Company in the operation of its
business prior to the Closing and that should have been assigned, transferred
and conveyed to the Company by such Affiliate prior to the Closing, were
retained by Seller or its Affiliates, and, as a result, was not transferred,
assigned, conveyed and delivered to the Company at or prior to Closing, Seller
will or will cause such Affiliate to transfer, assign, convey and deliver
such asset or property to the Company for no additional consideration (and at
Sellers or such Affiliates sole cost and expense), and will execute such
further documents and instruments necessary to give effect to and evidence
such transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery to the Company.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
promptly pay or deliver to the Company any monies or checks which have been
sent or delivered after the Closing Date to Seller or its Affiliate (including
any bank account or lock box maintained by or for the benefit of Seller or
such Affiliate) that should have been sent to the Company (including payments
by customers of the Company and its Billing Agreement Counterparties).

 

Section 6.21 _Migration Plan_. Buyer and Seller will work together in
good faith to establish, within 15 days of the date of this Agreement, a
migration plan for Company data and applications that are in Sellers or its
Affiliates possession or control to be transferred from Seller or such
Affiliates of Seller to the Company or Buyer (at Buyers election). In
connection with the establishment of the migration plan referenced in the
preceding sentence, prior to the Closing Buyer and Seller will reasonably and
in good faith negotiate the terms, including service fees (including lump sum
payment amounts), scope and duration of services with respect to the
"applications and systems" to be reflected on Schedule 1.1(c) of the
Transition Services Agreement.

(a) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(e)_, (ii) neither Seller
nor its Affiliates materially breached their obligations under _Section_ __ _
6.08_, (iii) the only condition to Closing that is not satisfied (or could not
be satisfied by the Termination Date) is _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ (and with respect to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_, only
if the applicable order, decision or injunction arises in connection with the
failure of any waiting period (or extension thereof) applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to expire or be terminated or any
approval or consent to be obtained, in each case, under or in relation to
the HSR Act), and (iv) the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ would have been satisfied if Buyer agreed or
committed to divest, hold separate or take or commit to take action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain
any of the businesses, services, or assets of Buyer that, taken as a whole,
would not have a material and adverse effect on Buyer and Buyer elected not to
take such actions, then Buyer will, by way of compensation, pay to the
Company an amount equal to $25,100,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") by wire
transfer (to an account designated by the Company) of immediately available
funds (x) prior to or concurrently with such termination in the event of a
termination by Buyer or (y) no later than five Business Days following such
termination in the event of a termination by Seller or the Company. In no
event will Buyer be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee other than in
the instance described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and in no event will
Buyer be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. The Parties acknowledge that the Reverse Termination Fee will not
constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Seller for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

(b) Except in the case of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement, in
any circumstance in which Seller receives the Reverse Termination Fee in full
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_, receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee
will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and its Affiliates against
Buyer and their respective officers, managers, directors, securityholders,
Affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, advisors and agents for any loss suffered
as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon
receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee, none of these parties will have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



60 Section 9.03 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in _Section_ __
_ 9.02_, if this Agreement is terminated as permitted by _Section_ __ _
9.01_, such termination will be without liability of any party (or any
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or other
representative of such party) to the other parties to this Agreement;
_provided_ that if such termination will result from the willful breach of any
of a partys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement prior to such termination, such party will be liable for all
damages actually incurred or suffered by any other party as a result of such
willful breach. For the purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, "willful
breach" means a breach that is the consequence of a deliberate act or
deliberate failure to act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge
that the taking of or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; _provided_ that, without limiting the
meaning of willful breach, the parties acknowledge and agree that any failure
by any party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
after the applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article 7_ have
been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby) will constitute a willful breach of this Agreement by
such party. The provisions of _Sections 6.04_ , _10.05_ , _10.07_ , _10.08_
and _10.09_ will survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01_.

Section 10.02 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_

.

 



62 (a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company
to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or
relating to the representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Representation"), of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (any such Person, a
"Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal counsel
currently representing the Company or Seller in connection with this Agreement
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, including Jones
Day (the "Current Representation").

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company to
waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring
during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer, and
following the Closing, with the Company, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control
such attorney-client privilege will be retained by such Designated Person.

 

Section 10.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be (i) amended, if such amendment
is in writing and is signed by Buyer and Seller, and (ii) waived, if such
waiver is in writing and is signed by the waiving parties.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_, the rights and remedies herein provided will be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

 

Section 10.04 _Transfer Taxes_. Fifty percent (50%) of all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees, however denominated, incurred in connection with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any direct or indirect real property
transfer Tax (together with any interest, penalties or additions thereto,
"Transfer Taxes"), will be borne and paid by Buyer, and fifty percent (50%) of
Transfer Taxes will be borne and paid by Seller, regardless of the Person on
whom liability is imposed under Applicable Law relating to such Taxes.
Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_, the party primarily required by
Applicable Law to file Transfer Tax Tax Returns will prepare and file such
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer
Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law, the other party will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation. The non-filing party will remit to the filing party an
amount equal to the non-filing partys share of Transfer Taxes due with
respect to any such Tax Return not less than five Business Days prior to the
due date for such payment. Each party will bear its own costs related to the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns.

 



63 Section 10.05 _Expenses_ . Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement will be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense; _provided_ that Buyer will be
responsible for (a) all filing fees payable in connection with any filings or
submissions under the HSR Act, (b) all filing and other similar fees payable
in connection with any other filing or submission made in respect of a
consent, authorization or approval from a Governmental Authority referred to
in _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, and (c) any deposits, premiums or other amounts
payable in respect of the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

Section 10.06 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto.

Section 10.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all questions, claims
or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution,
performance, interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement will be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to the laws of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction that would call for the application of the substantive
or procedural laws of any jurisdiction other than Delaware.

 

Section 10.08 _Jurisdiction_. Each party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally, for itself and its property, submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the
Delaware Court of Chancery is unavailable, in the Superior Court in the City
of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, and if jurisdiction in the
Superior Court in the City of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware is
unavailable, in the federal courts of the U.S. sitting in the State of
Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof (such courts in such
jurisdictional priority, the "Forum"), in any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby, and agrees that all claims in respect of such suit, action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in the Forum, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such
suit, action or proceeding except in the Forum, (b) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
the Forum, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in the Forum, and (d) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding in
the Forum. Each party hereby agrees that service of summons, complaint or
other process in connection with any suit, action or proceeding contemplated
hereby may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to such party at
the address specified pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, and that service
so made will be effective as if personally made in the State of Delaware.

 



64 Section 10.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED ON, OR ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, VERBAL OR WRITTEN
STATEMENT OR ACTION OF ANY PARTY, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE.

 

Section 10.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by
electronic signature delivered by electronic transmission in .pdf format),
each of which will be deemed an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
will become effective when each party hereto will have received a counterpart
(including by electronic signature delivered by electronic transmission in
.pdf format) hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each
party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement will have no effect and no party will have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). Except for _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.12 _Severability_ _._ If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties will
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company and Seller have set
forth information on the Seller Disclosure Schedules in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set
forth in one section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules need not be set forth
in any other section so long as its relevance to such other section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent
on the face of the information

 



65  disclosed therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made
notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the Seller Disclosure Schedules may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure by the Company or Seller of any
matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by the Company or Seller that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

 

Section 10.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge and
agree that (a) Buyer will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company or Seller or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by the Company
and Seller and (b) Seller will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by Buyer, in each case, in the
United States District Court of Delaware or any Delaware State court, in
addition to any other remedy to which such parties are entitled at law or in
equity.

Section 10.15 _Buyer Parent Guarantee_. Buyer Parent hereby
unconditionally, irrevocably, and absolutely guarantees to Seller the full and
timely performance of Buyers obligations (including the due and punctual
payment of the Purchase Price) pursuant to this Agreement
(the "Obligations"). The guarantee under this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ is a
guarantee of performance and not merely of collection, and Buyer Parents
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ are primary obligations and not
those of a mere surety. Upon default with respect to any Obligations, Seller
will have no obligation to proceed against Buyer, and may proceed directly
against Buyer Parent without first proceeding against Buyer or any other
Person or pursuing any other remedy. Buyer Parent will reimburse Seller for
all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including court
and arbitration costs and reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Seller in
connection with the enforcement of such Sellers rights under this _Section_
__ _ 10.15_. Buyer Parents obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.15_
will not be affected by the commencement of any proceedings by or against
Buyer under any liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium,
receivership, insolvency, or similar debtor relief law or any stay or ruling
thereunder. If all or any part of any payment to or for the benefit of Seller
in respect of an Obligation is invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required for any reason to be repaid or paid to
a trustee, receiver or other third Person, the Obligations that otherwise
would have been satisfied by that payment or partial payment will be revived
and will continue in full force and effect as if that payment had not been
made. Buyer may, without notice to Buyer Parent, extend or alter, together
with Seller, the time, manner, place or terms of payment or performance of the
Obligations, waive or (together with Seller) amend any terms of this
Agreement, or otherwise exercise its rights hereunder without in any way
changing, releasing, or discharging Buyer Parent from liability under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.15_. Buyer Parent waives notice of acceptance, presentment,
demand, protest, and notices of protest, nonpayment, default or dishonor of
the Obligations, and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer Parent

 



66  expressly reserves to itself and will be entitled to assert (and Seller
hereby agrees that Buyer Parent may assert), as a complete or partial defense
to, or release or discharge of, any payment or performance by Buyer Parent
hereunder, any claim, set-off, deduction, defense, or release, to the extent
that Buyer could assert the same against Seller under the express terms of
this Agreement.
