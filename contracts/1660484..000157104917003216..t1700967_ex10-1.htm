provided for administration to patients enrolled in clinical trials or for

ARTICLE II _ 
  
 CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS_

  



  

Section 2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to
receive contingent cash payments pursuant to this Agreement. The CVRs shall be
issued pursuant to the Acquisition at the time and in the manner set forth in
the Scheme Document.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer.
Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or
disposition of CVRs, in whole or in part, in violation of this _Section 2.2_
shall be void _ab initio_ and of no effect. The CVRs have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and will not be listed for trading on any securities
exchange.

  



    

8

 



    



  

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of
Transfer; Change of Address_.

  



  

(a) The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other
instrument.

  



  

(b) The Rights Agent will keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ")
for the purpose of registering CVRs and Permitted Transfers thereof. The CVR
Register will initially show one position for Cede and Co. representing all of
the Innocoll Shares held by DTC on behalf of the street holders of the
Innocoll Shares held by such holders as of immediately prior to the [Voting
Record Time (as defined in the Scheme Document)]. The Rights Agent will have
no responsibility whatsoever directly to the street name holders with respect
to transfers of CVRs. With respect to any payments to be made under _Section
2.4_ below, the Rights Agent will accomplish the payment to any former street
name holders of the Innocoll Shares by sending a lump payment to DTC. The
Rights Agent will have no responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the
distribution of payments by DTC to such street name holders.

  



  

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in
_Section 2.2_ , every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by
the Holder thereof, the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, the
Holder's personal representative or the Holder's survivor, and setting forth
in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon
receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its
reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and
the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including the provisions of _Section 2.2_ ), register the transfer
of the CVRs in the CVR Register. The Buyer and Rights Agent may require
payment, from such transferee, of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or
other Tax or governmental charge that is imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation
to take any action under any section of this Agreement that requires the
payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable Taxes or charges unless and until
the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have been paid.
All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register will be the valid
obligations of the Buyer and will entitle the transferee to the same benefits
and rights under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to the
transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR will be valid until
registered in the CVR Register in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to
change such Holder's address of record in the CVR Register. The written
request must be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written
notice, the Rights Agent will promptly record the change of address in the
CVR Register.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Payment Procedures; Notices_.

  



  

(a) If a CVR Payment Event is attained, then, on or prior to the CVR
Payment Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Rights Agent (i) written notice
indicating that a CVR Payment Event has been achieved and specifying such CVR
Payment Event (a " _CVR Payment Event Notice_ "), (ii) an Officer's
Certificate certifying the date of such achievement and that the Holders are
entitled to receive the applicable CVR Payment Event and (iii) the payment
required by _Section 4.2_.

(b) The Rights Agent will promptly, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of a CVR Payment Event Notice, send each Holder at
its registered address a copy of such CVR Payment Event Notice and pay the
applicable CVR Payment Amount to each of the Holders by check mailed to the
address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of
business on the date of the CVR Payment Event Notice.

  



  

(c) Except to the extent any portion of a CVR Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the parties hereto
intend to treat CVR Payments for all Tax purposes as additional consideration
for the Innocoll Shares and Innocoll Share Awards (as defined in the
Transaction Agreement) pursuant to the Scheme Document. Except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of applicable
Law), the Buyer or its Affiliate shall (or shall cause the Rights Agent to)
determine the portion of any CVR Payment required to be treated as interest
pursuant to Section 483 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (or any comparable provision of applicable Law). The Buyer shall
report imputed interest on the CVRs as required by applicable Law.

  



  

(d) The Buyer or its Affiliate shall (or shall cause the Rights
Agent to) deduct and withhold from any CVR Payment Amount or any
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under applicable Tax
Law, as may reasonably be determined by the Buyer. Any such withholding may be
made, or caused to be made, at the request of the Buyer or its Affiliate,
through making payments with respect to Holders who received CVRs in
consideration of Innocoll Share Awards through the Company's or any of its
Affiliates' payroll system or any successor payroll system. Prior to making
any CVR Payment, the Buyer or its Affiliate shall (or shall cause the Rights
Agent to) solicit IRS Form W-9s or W-8s, or any other appropriate forms or
information, from Holders in order to provide a reasonable opportunity for the
Holder to timely provide any necessary Tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9
or an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to mitigate or reduce such
withholding, and such CVR Payment may be reasonably delayed in order to
gather such necessary Tax forms. The Buyer, its Affiliates and the
Rights Agent may assume all such forms in their possession or provided by any
Holder are valid under applicable Law until subsequently notified by such
Holder. The Buyer or its Affiliate shall (or shall cause the Rights Agent to)
take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any amounts withheld in
respect of Taxes are promptly remitted to the appropriate Relevant Authority.
To the extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld and properly remitted
to the appropriate Relevant Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made, and as required by applicable
Law, the Buyer or its Affiliate shall (or shall cause the Rights Agent to)
deliver to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid an
original IRS Form 1099 or other reasonably acceptable evidence of such
withholding.

  



  

(e) Any portion of any CVR Payment Amount that remains undistributed
to a Holder six (6) months after the date of the delivery of the CVR Payment
Event Notice will be delivered by the Rights Agent to the Buyer, upon demand,
and any Holder will thereafter look only to the Buyer for payment of such CVR
Payment Amount, without interest, but such Holder will have no greater rights
against the Buyer than those accorded to general unsecured creditors of the
Buyer under applicable Law.

(f) Neither the Buyer nor the Rights Agent will be liable to any
person in respect of any CVR Payment Amount delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If, despite the Buyer's and/or the Rights Agent's commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver a CVR Payment Amount to the applicable Holder,
such CVR Payment Amount has not been paid prior to two (2) years after the
applicable CVR Payment Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which such CVR Payment Amount would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Relevant Authority), any such CVR Payment Amount will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Buyer, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. In
addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity obligation herein,
the Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Rights Agent with respect
to any liability, penalty, cost or expense the Rights Agent may incur or be
subject to in connection with transferring such property to the Buyer.

the Buyer, the Company, any constituent company to the Acquisition or any of
their respective Affiliates.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Ability to Abandon CVR_. A Holder may at any time, at
such Holder's option, abandon all of such Holder's remaining rights in a CVR
by transferring such CVR to the Buyer without consideration therefor. Nothing
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Buyer or any of its Affiliates from
offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration from the Holders,
in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole discretion. Any CVRs
acquired by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall be automatically deemed
extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of the definition of
Acting Holders and Article V and _Section 6.3_ hereunder.

so specified but in no event will such resignation become effective until a

of a Rights Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing

ARTICLE IV _ 
  
 COVENANTS_

  



  

Section 4.1 _List of Holders_. The Buyer will furnish or cause to
be furnished to the Rights Agent in such form as the Buyer receives from
the Company's transfer agent (or other agent performing similar services for
the Company), the names and addresses of the Holders within seven (7)
calendar days of the Effective Date. The Rights Agent will reflect such names
and addresses on the CVR Register and confirm the write up of the CVR
Register to the Buyer promptly thereafter and, in any event, within five (5)
calendar days of the receipt of such names and addresses from the Buyer or
the Company's transfer agent, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Payment of CVR Payment Amounts_. If a CVR Payment
Event has occurred, the Buyer will, within ten (10) Business Days following
the delivery of the applicable CVR Payment Event Notice to the Rights Agent,
deposit with the Rights Agent, for payment to the Holders in accordance with
_Section 2.4_ , the aggregate amount necessary to pay the CVR Payment Amount
to each Holder. For the avoidance of doubt, the CVR Payment Amount shall only
be paid in respect of a given CVR Payment Event, if at all, one time under
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Books and Records_. The Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, keep, true, complete and accurate records in sufficient
detail to enable the amounts payable under this Agreement for a period of two
(2) years following the end of the Fourth CVR Payment Event Measurement
Period 2020.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Audits_.

  



  

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders and no more than
once during any calendar year, and upon thirty (30) days' prior written
notice, the Company shall provide an independent certified public accounting
firm of nationally recognized standing selected jointly by the Acting Holders
and the Buyer (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") with access during normal
business hours to such of the records of the Buyer as may be reasonably
necessary to verify the accuracy of the Buyer calculation of Net Sales and
the figures underlying the calculations set forth therein for any period
within the preceding three (3) years that has not previously been audited in
accordance with this _Section 4.4_. The Buyer shall pay for the fees charged
by the Independent Accountant in the event that the Independent Accountant
determines that the amount of Net Sales calculated by the Buyer is more than
five percent (5%) below the actual amount of Net Sales calculated in
accordance with the manner in which "Net Sales" is defined pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Acting Holders shall pay for the fees
charged by such Independent Accountant in the event that the Independent
Accountant determines that the amount of Net Sales calculated by the Buyer is
equal to or less than five percent (5%) below the actual amount of Net Sales
calculated in accordance with the manner in which "Net Sales" is defined
pursuant to this Agreement, which amount the Buyer may deduct from any future
CVR Payments payable pursuant to this Agreement as its sole recourse for
obtaining reimbursement for this fee. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this

  



    

14

 



    



  

Agreement for a period of two (2) years; _provided_ that the Holders shall
only be entitled to one audit following termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) If the Independent Accountant concludes that the Buyer did not
properly calculate Net Sales and as a result the Holders were entitled to
receive either the Fourth CVR Payment 2019 or Fourth CVR Payment 2020 (the "
_Failed Fourth CVR Payment_ "), the Buyer shall pay the Failed Fourth CVR
Payment, within three (3) months of the date the Acting Holders deliver to the
Buyer the Independent Accountant's written report (the " _Independent
Accountant Report_ "); _provided_ that the respective amount due under the
Failed Fourth CVR Payment shall bear interest at the Default Interest Rate
beginning from thirty (30) days after the date the Acting Holders deliver to
the Buyer the Independent Accountant Report until payment is made to
the Rights Agent. The decision of such Independent Accountant shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Buyer and the Holders, shall be non-appealable
and shall not be subject to further review.

  



  

(c) Each Person seeking to receive information from the Buyer in
connection with a review or audit shall enter into, and shall cause
its accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory
confidentiality agreement with the Buyer obligating such party to retain all
such financial information disclosed to such party in confidence pursuant to
such confidentiality agreement.

  



  

(d) The Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
enter into any license or distribution agreement with any third party
(other than the Buyer or its Affiliates) with respect to any Product unless
such agreement contains provisions that would allow any
Independent Accountant appointed pursuant to this _Section 4.4_ such access
to the records of the other party to such license or distribution agreement
as may be reasonably necessary to perform its duties pursuant to this _Section
4.4_ ; _provided_ , that the Buyer and its Affiliates may redact documents
and information not relevant for such evaluation pursuant to this _Section
4.4_. The Parties agree that, if the Buyer or its Affiliates have exercised
audit rights under any license or distribution agreement prior to the Acting
Holders' request for an audit under this _Section 4.4_ and under such license
or distribution agreement the Buyer and its Affiliates cannot request another
audit, the results of the Buyer's prior audit of such licensee or
distributor will be used for purposes of the audit requested by the Acting
Holders under this _Section 4.4_ and that the Buyer shall not have any
further obligation to provide access to an Independent Accountant with respect
to such licensee until such time as the Buyer may again exercise its rights
of audit under the license agreement with such licensee.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Product Transfer_. Subject to _Section 7.3_ of this
Agreement, so long as the CVRs remain Outstanding, the Buyer and its
Affiliates may not, directly or indirectly, by a sale or swap of assets,
merger, reorganization, joint venture, lease, license or any
other transaction or arrangement, sell, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose
of their respective rights in and to the Product to a third party (other than
the Buyer or its Affiliates), unless at all times after any such sale,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition, the gross amounts invoiced for the
Product by the applicable transferee will be reflected in Net Sales in
accordance with the terms hereunder as if such transferee was the Buyer, and
the contract for such sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
(which the Buyer shall take all reasonable actions necessary to enforce in
all material respects) shall provide for such treatment and shall require the
transferee to comply with the

  



    

15

 



    



  

covenants in this  _Section 4.5_ and _Sections 4.4_ , _4.6_ and _4.7_ hereof
to the same extent as the Buyer.

prior to December 31, 2019.

  



  

Section 4.8 _No Conflicting Agreements_. So long as any of the
CVRs remain Outstanding, the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the
Company to, enter into any stockholder agreement, member agreement or similar
agreement or credit, loan or similar agreement which would prohibit,
materially delay or condition payment of any CVR Payment that becomes due
under this Agreement or which would prohibit, materially delay or condition
the transfer of funds by the Company to the Buyer (by way of dividend, loan or
otherwise) to provide a payment source to fund any CVR Payment that becomes
due under this Agreement; _provided_ , that any agreement entered into by the
Company prior to the Effective Date, including that certain Finance Contract,
dated as of March 27, 2015, among European Investment Bank, Innocoll
Pharmaceuticals Limited and Innocoll AG (as amended prior to the Effective
Date, the " _Finance Contract_ "), shall not be considered for purposes of
determining the Buyer's compliance with this _Section 4.8_ ; provided that
the Finance Contract shall not be amended, revised or restated after the
Effective Date in any manner that would prohibit, materially delay or
condition the transfer of funds by the Company to the Buyer (by way of
dividend, loan or otherwise) to provide a payment source to fund any CVR
Payment that becomes due under this Agreement (other than as provided in the
Finance Contract as of the Effective Date).

The Rights Agent or the Buyer may specify a different address or facsimile
number by giving notice in accordance with this _Section 7.1_.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for
notice to Holders, such notice will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise
herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage
prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at the Holder's address as it
appears in the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier
than the earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In
any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail
such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder
will affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Buyer Successors and Assigns_. The Buyer may assign,
in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Buyer or to any purchaser or
licensee of substantial rights to the Product (each, an " _Assignee_ ")
provided that the Assignee agrees to assume and be bound by all of the terms
of this Agreement. Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more
additional Assignees who agree to assume and be bound by all of the terms of
this Agreement; provided, however, that in connection with any assignment to
an Assignee, the Buyer (or the other assignor) shall agree to remain liable
for the performance by each Assignee (and such other assignor, if applicable)
of all obligations of the Buyer hereunder, with such Assignee substituted for
the Buyer under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the Buyer's successors and each
Assignee, and this Agreement shall not restrict the Buyer's, any Assignee's or
any of their respective successors' ability to merge or consolidate. Each of
the Buyer's successors and assigns shall expressly assume by an instrument

supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Rights Agent, the due and
punctual payment of the CVRs and the due and punctual performance and
observance of all of the covenants and obligations of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by the Buyer. The Rights Agent may not assign this
Agreement without the Buyer's written consent. Any attempted assignment of
this Agreement or any such rights in violation of this _Section 7.3_ shall be
void and of no effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, so
long as the CVRs remain Outstanding, the Buyer may not sell, transfer or
otherwise convey the Company to an Affiliate of the Buyer (including by way
of a merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis or any other
transaction involving the Company in which the Buyer and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries ceases to hold one hundred percent (100%) of the
Company's voting power immediately after such transaction) unless (i)
such Affiliate assumes and agrees to be bound by all of Buyer's obligations,
duties and covenants under this Agreement and (ii) Buyer and such Affiliate
or Affiliates who are bound by all of Buyer's obligations, duties and
covenants under this Agreement (with their direct and indirect subsidiaries)
own one hundred percent (100%) of the Company's voting power immediately
after such transaction.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, will give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, the
Buyer, the Buyer's successors and Assignees, the Holders and the Holders'
successors and assigns pursuant to a Permitted Transfer) any benefit or any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any
covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions
being for the sole benefit of the foregoing. The rights of Holders and their
successors and assigns pursuant to Permitted Transfers are limited to those
expressly provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any Holder or Holder's successor or assign
pursuant to a Permitted Transfer may agree to renounce, in whole or in part,
its rights under this Agreement by written notice to the Rights Agent and the
Buyer, which notice, if given, shall be irrevocable.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the

in the State of Delaware and any appellate court therefrom (collectively, the
" _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii) consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such party is to receive notice in accordance with _Section 7.1_.
Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter

in the Delaware Courts

  



    

22

 



    



  

and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Courts.

  



  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED
ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION
7.5(c)_.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an
electronic scan delivered by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed
an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that the parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Termination_. This Agreement will be terminated and
of no force or effect, the parties hereto will have no liability hereunder
(other than with respect to monies due and owing by the Buyer to the Rights
Agent), and no payments will be required to be made, upon the earliest to
occur of (a) the mailing by the Rights Agent to the address of each Holder as
reflected in the CVR Register the full amount of all potential CVR Payment
Amounts (if any) required to be paid under the terms of this Agreement, (b)
the delivery of a written notice of termination duly executed by the Buyer
and the Acting Holders and (c) March 31, 2020, with respect to the
Buyer's obligation to pay the Fourth CVR Payment Event 2020 if not then
achieved.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Scheme
Document (including the schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto and the
documents and instruments referred to therein) contain the entire
understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the
transactions and matters contemplated hereby and thereby and supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties with respect hereto and
thereto.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Legal Holiday_. In the event that a CVR Payment Date
shall not be a Business Day, then, notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any

  



    

23

 



    



  

payment required to be made in respect of the CVRs on such date need not be
made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with
the same force and effect as if made on the applicable CVR Payment Date.
