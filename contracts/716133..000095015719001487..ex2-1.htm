of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and determined that the Merger on the  terms
provided for in this Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of the

those conditions), or at  such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
in writing between the Company and Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
all the conditions set forth in Article VII do not remain satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by Law) have not  been waived on such third Business Day,

the extent  permitted by applicable Law, at such later time as is agreed to
by the parties hereto prior to the filing of such Certificate of Merger and

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of any shares of common stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Shares_ ") or any shares of capital stock
of Merger Sub:

 


 

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common  stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

 

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Shares_. All Company Common Shares that are owned
by the Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no  consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. All Company Common Shares held by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange  therefor.
Each Company Common Share that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall not
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at the
election  of Parent, either (i) converted into shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled. Each Excluded Share shall be canceled
at the Effective Time and, subject to Section 2.03, no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange  therefor.

 


 

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Subject to Section 2.01(b), each
Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

Section 2.03 (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $10.50
per share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").       As of
the Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares, when so converted pursuant
to this Section 2.01(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such Company Common Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (other than any
Excluded Shares) and each holder of Company Common Shares held in book-entry
form (other than any Excluded Shares)  shall, in each case, cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor. The right of any holder of
Company Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration shall  be subject
in all cases to the provisions of Section 2.02.

 


 

 

(d) _6 3/4% Preferred Shares_. Each 6 3/4% Preferred Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding immediately following the Effective Time as one  6 3/4%
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Share, without par value, of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall not be affected by the Merger (except for the effects
specifically set forth in Article Fourth of the Company Articles).

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates; Book-Entry Shares_. (a) _Paying
Agent_. Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying  Agent_ ") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection
therewith, prior to the Closing Date shall enter into an agreement with the
Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.   At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares, for exchange in accordance
with this Article II through the Paying Agent, an amount of cash sufficient to
pay the  aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 


 

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each  holder of record of
Company Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates
shall  pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry  form) as Parent may specify subject to the
Company's reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto.

 


 

 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of Company Common Shares represented by a Certificate, the surrender
of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying  Agent, or (ii) in the
case of Company Common Shares held in book-entry form, the receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together with the
associated Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance  with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Company Common Share formerly  represented by such Certificate or held in
book-entry form, as applicable, and the shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the  surrendered Certificate or share
held in book-entry form is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that
(x) such Certificate or share held in book-entry form so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or share held in 
book-entry form surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has either been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02(c), each Company  Common Share, and any Certificate with respect thereto
shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holders of Company Common Shares were  entitled to receive in respect of
such shares pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or any Company
Common Shares held in book-entry form).

 


 

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or Company Common
Shares held in

 


 

 


 

 

 

4  


 

 


 

 

book-entry form) in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificates (or Company
Common Shares held  in book-entry form). From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares (or Company
Common Shares held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as  provided in
this Article II.

 


 

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for one year  after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of
Company Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of its  claim for Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II.

 


 

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official in compliance  with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares
immediately prior to such date on which the Exchange Fund otherwise would be 
required to escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 


 

 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. Pending its disbursement in accordance with
this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Any interest and other  income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as
to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a  level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration
in accordance herewith. No investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder
of Company  Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein.

 


 

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any  holder of Company Common
Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the
extent  that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Shares
in respect of which such deduction  and withholding was made.

 


 

 


 

 

 

5  


 

 


 

 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed  and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay,  in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.03. _Dissenters ' Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (but subject to this Section 2.03), any Company
Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the
Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand, and has
properly demanded, appraisal for such Company Common Shares in accordance
with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (such
shares,  " _Common Appraisal Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be  determined to be due to such shareholder pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; _provided_ that if
any such shareholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses its right of  appraisal pursuant to the OGCL, then the right
of such shareholder to be paid the fair cash value of such Common Appraisal
Shares shall cease, and such Common Appraisal Shares shall instead be deemed
to have been converted into the right to receive  the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon.

 


 

 

(b) Subject to any redemption made in accordance with the Company Articles,
any 6 3/4% Preferred Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is  entitled to demand,
and has properly demanded, appraisal for such 6 3/4% Preferred Shares in
accordance with, and who complies with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (such
shares, " _Preferred Appraisal Shares_ " and, together with the Common
Appraisal  Shares, the " _Appraisal Shares_ "), shall not remain outstanding
as provided in Section 2.01(d), but instead shall be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
shareholder pursuant to the  procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the
OGCL; _provided_ that if any such shareholder withdraws its demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal
pursuant to the OGCL, then the right of such  shareholder to be paid the fair
cash value of such Preferred Appraisal Shares shall cease, and such Preferred
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have remained outstanding in accordance
with Section 2.01(d).

 


 

 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all  negotiations and
Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do 
any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent
of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

SECTION 2.04. _Adjustments_. If between the date hereof and the Effective Time
the outstanding Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason  of the occurrence or record
date of any share split, reverse share split, share dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,  combination,
exchange of shares or other like change, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such share split, reverse share split, share dividend
(including any  dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change.

Company before the execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement (the "
_Parent Disclosure Letter_ "). The Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections  contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any section
shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this Article III to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure also qualifies or  applies to such other sections.

 


 

 

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of

Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority and
possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, 
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ")
necessary to enable it to own, lease, operate or otherwise hold its properties
and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted (the " _Parent
Permits_ "),  except where the failure to have such power or authority or to
possess Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly  qualified or licensed to do business
in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership,
operation or leasing of its properties and assets makes such qualification
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to  be so

Sub, no other corporate or similar proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this
Agreement or to  consummate the Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,  enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws of general application affecting or relating
to  the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in

its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or  assets, other than, in

reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is  first mailed to the
Company's shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,

Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited 
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet

avoid disclosure of any  material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Company Subsidiary's published financial statements or other
Company SEC Documents.

Company Subsidiary with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been paid or

any pending Action by or before the FCC or any State Regulator to suspend,
revoke  or cancel, or any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or any

with respect thereto and with respect to any Unlicensed Activity required by
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ "), or
the rules, regulations, written policies and orders of the FCC (the " _FCC
Rules_ ") or  similar rules, regulations, written policies and orders of
State Regulators, and the payment of all regulatory

or allowances and except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate,

Adverse Effect.  The Company and each licensee of each Company License and
each of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries is in good standing with the FCC and all
other Governmental Entities, and neither the Company nor any such licensee or
any of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries  is, to the Knowledge of the Company, the

inquiry, subpoena, forfeiture, or petition to suspend before the FCC, the
Universal Service Administrative Company (the " _USAC_ ") or  any other
Governmental Entity and except for matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company or a Company Subsidiary owns one hundred
percent  (100%) of the equity and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the
voting power and decision-making authority of each licensee of the Company
Licenses and each of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries.

currently effective cease-and-desist order or enforcement action issued by, or
is a party to any consent agreement or memorandum of  understanding with, or
has been ordered since December 31, 2016, to pay any civil money penalty by,
the FCC, USAC or any other Governmental Entity (other than a taxing authority,
which is covered by Section 4.09), other than those of general  application
that apply to similarly situated providers of the same services or their
Subsidiaries and that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (each
item in  this sentence, whether or not set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter, a " _Company Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has the Company or any of

38  


 

 


 

 

enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court having
jurisdiction. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing  solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, or

immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives
receives a bona fide oral or written Company Takeover Proposal,  which
Company Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02,
(i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person making the
Company Takeover Proposal or its Representatives to  request that any bona
fide Company Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii) in
response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after  consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisor) that the failure to take the following actions would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under

reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may (and
may authorize and permit its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to),
subject to compliance with Section 5.02(e), (A) enter into an Acceptable 
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal
and furnish information pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(including non-public information and data) with respect to the Company and

in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and such Person's  Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.02 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.02 by the  Company.

 


 

 

(c) Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw or fail to make when required by this Agreement
(or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or propose  or agree to withdraw
or fail to make when required by this Agreement (or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) adopt, recommend
or declare advisable, or propose or agree to adopt, recommend or declare 
advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or
(ii) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose or agree to adopt,
recommend or declare  advisable, or allow the Company or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any confidentiality agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger  agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement or arrangement (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting, or that may reasonably be expected
to  lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to

 


 

 


 

 

 

39  


 

 


 

 

obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may (I) make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) cause the Company to enter into
an Acquisition Agreement constituting or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to a  Company Takeover Proposal not obtained in violation of this
Section 5.02 and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii), in
either case if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a  financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation), that (x) in the case of clause (I), where the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change is made in response to an Intervening Event, or the
consequences thereof, and the failure to take such action  would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) in the case of (A) clause (I) where such Adverse
Recommendation Change is made in response to a Company Takeover Proposal, or
(B) clause  (II), such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Company Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
entitled to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or take any action
set forth in clause (II) unless  (1) the Company has given Parent at least
five Business Days' prior written notice (a " _Company Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to any material term of any Superior Company Proposal shall  require a new
Company Notice of Recommendation Change and a new notice period (which shall
be two Business Days instead of five Business Days)) advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action (which notice shall specify the 
identity of the party making such Superior Company Proposal and the material
terms thereof and, in the case of an Intervening Event, specifying the details
thereof), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in  good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a
binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it
would cause such Superior Company  Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Company Proposal or for such Intervening Event to no longer warrant a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (3) following the end of such
notice period, the Company Board or any committee thereof shall  have
considered in good faith such binding offer or Intervening Event, and shall
have determined that the Superior Company Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Company Proposal if the revisions proposed in such
binding offer were to be  given effect or that such Intervening Event
continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and _provided_ ,
_further_ that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force  and effect unless the termination is
in accordance with Section 8.01 and, to the extent required under the terms of
this Agreement, the Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the applicable
Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 6.06  prior to or
concurrently with such termination so long as Parent has provided the Company
with wire instructions for such payment.

 


 

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
through (c) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours of receipt thereof by an officer  or director of the
Company) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal
or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Company  Takeover Proposal or inquiry or proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry or proposal, (ii) keep Parent informed in all material
respects on a reasonably current basis  of the status and details (including
any change to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal, and

 


 

 


 

 

 

40  


 

 


 

 

(iii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery

date of this Agreement), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with
the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form to be sent to the shareholders
of the Company relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting (together with 
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person and
its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other assistance, as may be
reasonably  requested in connection with the preparation, filing and

Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent, as
applicable, (i) shall provide the  other an opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or response all
comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall  not file or mail
such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the

Nothing in this Section 6.01(b)  shall limit the obligations of any party
under Section 6.01(a).

 


 

 

(c) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the  Proxy Statement,
which the Company in good faith believes is required to be described in an

(d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company

Approval. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments
on  the Proxy Statement (or the date on which the ten-day period referred to
in rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act has expired without receipt of SEC
comments or notice from the SEC that it will provide comments) (but in any
event no more than 15 Business  Days thereafter) and to hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting as soon as practicable thereafter and (ii) solicit the
Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.02(c), the Company shall,
through the Company Board, recommend to its  shareholders that they give the
Company Shareholder Approval and shall include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement. The Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public  proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover
Proposal or by the making of any Company Adverse Recommendation Change by the
Company Board; provided, however, that the Company shall be permitted to
postpone  convening or to adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting (but not
beyond the End Date) if (x) such postponement or adjournment is required to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure in  accordance with Section 6.01(b) or
Section 6.01(c) and to permit such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's shareholders prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting, (y) such postponement or adjournment is  in order to
solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval or (z) as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there
are  insufficient Company Common Shares and 6 3/4% Preferred Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.

business or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be obligated to provide such access or  information if the Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so is reasonably likely to
(i) violate applicable Law or an applicable Judgment or (ii) jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product  protection
or other legal privilege held by the Company. In any such event, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way  that would not violate applicable Law, Judgment or obligation or risk
waiver of such privilege or protection or risk such liability, including
entering into a joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other
similar arrangement. All  requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 6.02 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person

As used herein, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal
to $17,970,000.

 


 

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this Section 6.06 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto  would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 6.06 and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences an Action that results in a Judgment in its favor for such 
payment, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent its costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of such
payment from the date  such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate as published by The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

 


 

 

(d) Subject in all respects to Parent's injunction, specific performance and
equitable relief rights and related rights set forth in Section 9.10 and the
reimbursement obligations of the Company under Section  6.06(c) hereof, in
the event that this Agreement is terminated and the Company Termination Fee is
paid to Parent in circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to
Section 6.06(b), payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole
and  exclusive monetary damages remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor
or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, financing sources, managers, members, directors,
officers or Affiliates  (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ")
against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders,
managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company      Related
Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise (so long as, in the event that this Agreement was terminated by
the Company,  such termination was in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement), and, subject as aforesaid, upon payment of such
amount none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further monetary
liability or obligation relating to or  arising out of this Agreement or any
of the Transactions. While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.10 and the payment
of the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under this  Section 6.06,
under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a

Parent and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be reasonably
required to cause any dispositions of shares of  Company Capital Stock

of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the 
Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.09. _Public Announcements_. Unless and until a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the  opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required  by
applicable Law, Judgment, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
except for any matters referred to in, and made in compliance with, Section
5.02. The parties  hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto (the "
_Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding the  forgoing, this Section 6.09 shall not
apply to any press release or other public statement made by the Company or

Company Subsidiary) after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
shall receive (x) base salary or wages (as applicable) and target  annual
incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (y) other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to  the benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding, for purposes of determining such
comparability, any retention bonus, defined benefit pension or retiree or
post-employment welfare benefits,  except to the extent required by
applicable Law).

 


 

 

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee
benefit plan or program of Parent or its Affiliates in which Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents are eligible to  participate after
the Effective Time to take into account for purposes of vesting and
eligibility (and for purposes of benefit accrual under each vacation and other
paid time off plan or program) the service of such Continuing Employees prior
to the  Effective Time with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including
any predecessors thereto) as if such service were with Parent or its
Affiliates, in each case to the same extent that such service was recognized
by the Company or any Company  Subsidiary immediately prior to

 


 

 


 

 

 

52  


 

 


 

 

the Effective Time under the comparable Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ that
no such crediting of service shall be required to the extent it would result
in any duplication of benefits.

 


 

 

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee
benefit plan or program that is a group health plan of Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Company or any Company Subsidiary) in  which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time

or cause the waiver of, all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and  waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Continuing Employee
under the comparable Company Benefit  Plan and that have not been satisfied
as of the Effective Time and (ii) provide such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
during the plan year of and prior to any change in  coverage from a Company
Benefit Plan to such New Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under such New Plan.

 


 

 

(d) In the event that the Closing occurs prior to the Company paying annual
incentives in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, each
participant in a Company Benefit Plan that is an annual cash  incentive plan
shall receive a cash bonus based on the achievement of the target level of
performance, which bonus shall be prorated based on the number of days in the
applicable performance period that have elapsed as of the Closing. Any such
bonus  shall be paid, less any required withholding Taxes, as soon as
practicable (and in no event more than five (5) days) after the Closing Date.

 


 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and without limiting the
generality of Section 9.07, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Section 6.10 are included  for the sole benefit
of the parties, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Company Benefit Plan, Company Collective Bargaining Agreement, New Plan or
other  employee benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement (or
an undertaking to amend any such plan or arrangement), (ii) shall limit the
right of Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates to terminate,
amend or otherwise modify any  Company Benefit Plan, Company Collective
Bargaining Agreement, New Plan or other employee benefit plan, program,
policy, arrangement or agreement following the Effective Time or (iii) shall
create any third-party beneficiary or other right (A) in any  other Person,
including any Company Participant or any participant in any Company Benefit

beneficiary thereof) or (B) to continued employment with Parent or the Company

(b) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, will execute
and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent  adopting this
Agreement in accordance with the OGCL.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.12. _Other Investors_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, prior to the Effective Time, without
the prior written consent of the Company, Parent  shall not permit or agree
to permit any Person to obtain equity interests (or rights to obtain any
equity interests) in Parent or any Person of which Merger Sub is a direct or
indirect Subsidiary.

set forth in this Section 6.15, Parent shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any provision of

any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of  any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the conditions to the Transactions set forth in Article
VII not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially
delayed in  violation of any provision of this Agreement; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall not (x)
cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this
Agreement or (y) limit the remedies  available to the party receiving such
notice; provided further, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to
clause (ii) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Transactions
set forth in Article VII except to the extent that the  underlying fact or
circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.

73  


 

 


 

 

the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid or contrary to Law, and not to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would  provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically  the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.10 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
