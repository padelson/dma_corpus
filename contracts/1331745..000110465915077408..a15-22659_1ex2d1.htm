issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Triton Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value
$0.01 per common share, of the Triton Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only issued shares of the Triton Surviving Corporation from and after the
Triton Effective Time. From and after the Triton Effective Time, all
certificates representing Bermuda Sub Common Shares shall be deemed for all
purposes to represent the number of common shares of the Triton Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

 



 

(e) _Conversion of Delaware Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Delaware Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the TAL Effective

constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the TAL Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(f) _Repurchase and Cancellation of Holdco Common Shares_. Each common share
of Holdco that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Triton
Effective Time shall, subject to applicable solvency tests being met as of the
Triton Effective Time, automatically be repurchased by Holdco at the Triton

pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or
issues by reclassification any shares of TAL Common Stock (in each case,
subject to the approval of Triton pursuant to _Section 6.1_) or Triton Common
Shares (in each case, subject to the approval of TAL pursuant to _Section
6.2_), as applicable, then the TAL Exchange Ratio or Triton Exchange Ratio and
any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of TAL Common Stock and
Triton Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the TAL Exchange Ratio, Triton Exchange Ratio or other
dependent item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance
with this sentence.

 



 

(h) _Shares of Triton Dissenting Holders_.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, all Triton Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, converted into the right to

is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure.

 



 

(ii) In the event that a holder fails to exercise, effectively withdraws or

(iii) Triton shall give TAL (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal of Triton Dissenting Shares, Appraisal Withdrawals and any other
instruments, notices, petitions or other written communication received by
Triton in accordance with this _Section 3.1(h)_ and (B) to the extent that
Triton has knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda
for appraisal of the fair value of the Triton Dissenting Shares and (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with
Triton in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. Triton shall not, without the

timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action
to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the Companies Act. Payment of
any amount payable to holders of Triton Dissenting Shares shall be the
obligation of Triton.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, (i)

denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (y) cash in an
amount sufficient to pay any cash payable in the Triton Merger in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_, and (ii) for the benefit of
the holders of TAL Common Stock, certificates or evidence of shares in book
entry form representing the Holdco Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the
TAL Merger in such denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify.
Following the Effective Time, Holdco shall deposit promptly, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent any dividends or distributions to which the
shareholders of TAL or Triton may be entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ in
an amount sufficient to pay such dividends or distributions to shareholders of
Holdco. Such certificates (or evidence of book-entry form, as the case may be)
for Holdco Common Shares, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, are
hereinafter

 



      
 

 



 

referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on cash
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.2_. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Holdco; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such investments shall be in direct obligations of or fully
guaranteed by the United States of America (or any agency thereof that is
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America), in money
market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment or in deposit
accounts, short-term negotiable certificates of deposit or short-term
negotiable bankers acceptances of one or more commercial banks, each of which
has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $10.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available at the SEC or otherwise). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to Holdco and any
amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 3.2(c)_ and _Section
3.2(g)_ shall be promptly returned to Holdco. To the extent that there are any
losses with respect to any such investments, or such cash diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to make prompt cash
payment of amounts under _Section 3.2(c)_ and _Section 3.2(g)_, Holdco shall
promptly replace or restore the cash so as to ensure that there is sufficient
cash for the Exchange Agent to make all such payments.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, TAL and
Triton shall jointly designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to act as
exchange agent hereunder (or if ComputerShare Trust Company, N.A. is unwilling
or unable to serve as exchange agent, a bank or trust company mutually agreed
upon by Triton and TAL) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of
exchanging the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Holdco shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder,
as of the Effective Time, of TAL Common Stock or Triton Common Shares (such
holders, " _Former Holders_ " and such shares, the " _Former Shares_ "): (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder
representing such Former Shares, shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal (or
effective affidavits of loss, theft or destruction in lieu thereof meeting the
requirements of _Section 3.2(h)_), and shall be in customary form and have
such other provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to both of Triton and
TAL) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Exchange of Certificates_. Upon surrender in accordance with this
_Section 3.2_ by a Former Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or a
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed

 



      
 

 



 

and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, each Former
Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (x) a certificate or
book-entry representing that number of Holdco Common Shares (rounded down)
which such Former Holder has the right to receive in accordance with this
_Article III_ in respect of its Former Shares after taking into account all
stock then held by such Former Holder, and any Certificate surrendered in
respect thereof shall forthwith be marked as cancelled, and (y) a check in an
amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings
pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_) equal to any cash in lieu of fractional shares
that such Former Holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_
_ plus_ any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_. If issuance of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of issuance
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
issuance shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(iv) _Surrender of Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall
not be required to deliver a Certificate but may, if required by the Exchange
Agent, be required to deliver an executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. Each holder of record of
one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time
or following the Exchange Agents receipt of an "agents message" and/or the
applicable Letter of Transmittal (or, at any later time at which such Book-
Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Holdco shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after
such time, the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

(v) _No Further Rights in TAL Common Stock or Triton Common Shares_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_. All
Merger Consideration paid or issued upon such surrender shall be deemed to
have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shareholders of each of TAL and Triton in their capacity as shareholders of
each of TAL and Triton prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer book of TAL shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of TAL Common Stock that were
outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares presented to Holdco for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this _Article III_.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Holdco Common Shares with a
record date on or following the Effective Time issuable with respect to the
Former Shares, nor the cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in
this _Article III_. Upon surrender in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Article III_, there shall be issued to the holder of Former
Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to those Holdco Common Shares with a record date on or after the date
of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of surrender
and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those Holdco
Common Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time
but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Unless a longer period is prescribed by
applicable Law, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
shareholders of TAL or Triton on the six (6) month anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco, upon demand by Holdco, and any
shareholders of TAL and Triton who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of their claim
for any part of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Holdco Common Shares.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable to any
shareholder of TAL or Triton in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ that
remained undistributed to the shareholders of TAL and Triton shall be deemed
to and become the property of Holdco on the Business Day immediately prior to
the day that such property is required to be delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. To the
extent permitted under applicable Law, none of Holdco, Delaware Sub, Bermuda
Sub, Triton, TAL or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder of
TAL or Triton for any such property delivered to Holdco or to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



 

(f) _Withholding_. The Parties and the Exchange Agent shall each be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any shareholder of TAL or Triton such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
other provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by any Party or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
shareholders of TAL or Triton in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. The Parties agree to

 



      
 

 



 

cooperate reasonably with each other for purposes of determining whether any
Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the Mergers.

 



 

(g) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of a Holdco Common Share shall be issued in connection
with the Mergers, and in lieu thereof, any shareholder of Triton who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Holdco Common Share shall be
paid upon surrender of Triton Common Shares for exchange (and after taking
into account and aggregating the total number of Holdco Common Shares to be
issued in exchange for the Triton Common Shares represented by all
Certificates, or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, surrendered by such holder)
cash in an amount (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which
such shareholder (after taking into account and aggregating the total number
of Holdco Common Shares to be issued in exchange for the Triton Common Shares
represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder, or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing trading
price of a share of TAL Common Stock on the NYSE on the last Business Day
prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of the fact by the holder thereof and the holders compliance with
any other replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent,
including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, Holdco or
any other Party with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as
may be required pursuant to this _Article III_ in respect of the TAL Common
Stock or Triton Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, without interest.

 



 

Section 3.3 _TAL Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of TAL Common Stock subject to vesting
or other lapse restrictions under any TAL Stock Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a " _Restricted TAL Share_ ") shall, as of the Effective
Time, cease to represent TAL Common Stock and shall be converted into a number
of Holdco Common Shares equal to the TAL Exchange Ratio (rounded, if
necessary, to the nearest whole number) (each, a " _TAL Restricted Holdco
Share_ "), with such TAL Restricted Holdco Shares subject to the same terms
and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to such
Restricted TAL Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking
into account any acceleration of vesting that results from the Mergers).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, TAL shall take all actions that are necessary
(i) to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.3_,
including amending the terms of the TAL Stock Plans, and (ii) to ensure that
no individual shall have the right to receive any TAL Common Stock in
connection with the exercise of an option to acquire TAL Common Stock under
any TAL Stock Plan following the Effective Time. TAL shall keep Triton fully
informed with respect to all amendments, resolutions, notices and actions that
TAL

 



      
 

 



 

intends to adopt, distribute or take in connection with the matters described
in this _Section 3.3_, and shall provide Triton with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on all such amendments, resolutions and notices. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall deliver to
the holders of Restricted TAL Shares that are being converted pursuant to
_Section 3.3(a)_ notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
TAL Stock Plan, and stating that such Restricted TAL Shares have been
converted into restricted shares of Holdco, and that the agreements between
TAL and each such holder regarding such Restricted TAL Shares shall be assumed
by Holdco and continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by _Section 3.3(a)_ after giving effect to the TAL
Merger and the terms of the TAL Stock Plan) pursuant to the applicable equity
compensation plan of TAL or Holdco. In addition, Holdco shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Holdco Common Shares issuable under any TAL
Stock Plans to be listed on the NYSE. Not later than the Closing Date, Holdco
will file an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable
form) with respect to the TAL Restricted Holdco Shares and will distribute a
prospectus relating to such Form S-8, and Holdco will use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the TAL
Restricted Holdco Shares remain outstanding.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Triton Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) No option to acquire Triton Common Shares under any Triton Stock Plan
(each, a " _Triton Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of
the Effective Time shall be assumed by Holdco and each Triton Stock Option
shall, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof and as of
the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire Triton Common Shares
and shall be immediately cancelled for no consideration and the holder thereof
shall have no further rights with respect thereto. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Triton Stock Plan, Triton may take any corporate action such that any Triton
Stock Option then outstanding shall become fully exercisable and the holder of
such Triton Stock Option shall have the right, pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the applicable Triton Stock Plan, to exercise such option
immediately prior to the Effective Time for Triton Common Shares and such
Triton Common Shares received by the holder in connection with such exercise
shall be treated in accordance with _Section 3.1_ hereof.

 



 

(b) Each issued and outstanding Triton Common Share subject to vesting or
other lapse restrictions under any Triton Stock Plan immediately prior to the

Effective Time, cease to represent Triton Common Shares and shall be converted
into a number of Holdco Common Shares equal to the Triton Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole number) (each, a " _Triton Restricted Holdco
Share_ "), with such Triton Restricted Holdco Shares subject to the same terms
and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to such
Restricted Triton Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking
into account any acceleration of vesting that results from the Mergers).

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Triton shall take all actions that are
necessary (i) to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section
3.4_, including amending the terms of the Triton Stock Plans, and (ii) to

amendments, resolutions, notices and actions that Triton intends to adopt,
distribute or take in connection with the matters described in this _Section
3.4_, and shall provide TAL with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on all such amendments, resolutions and notices. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall deliver to the holders of
Restricted Triton Shares that are being converted pursuant to _Section
3.4(b)_ notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Triton
Stock Plan, and stating that such Restricted Triton Shares have been converted
into restricted shares of Holdco and that the agreements between Triton and
each such holder regarding such Restricted Triton Shares shall be assumed by
Holdco and continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by _Section 3.4(b)_ after giving effect to the Triton
Merger and the terms of the Triton Stock Plan) pursuant to the applicable

contribution to or future investment in any Person.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by TAL does not, and the

of notice or the lapse of time or both) of any right or obligation of TAL or
any Subsidiary of TAL under, any Contract to which TAL or a Subsidiary of TAL
is a party, except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for such
conflicts, violations, breaches or defaults that have not had, and would not
be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TAL
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by TAL does not, and the
performance by TAL of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, require TAL to obtain any consent, approval,
Order, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or notification
to (" _Consent_ "), any Governmental Entity, other than (i) any Consents as

and (iv) those Consents, the failure of which to be obtained or made would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TAL
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.6 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Internal Controls and
Procedures_.

 



 

(a) TAL has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, registration statements
and other documents required to be furnished or filed by TAL with the SEC
since

 



      
 

 



 

January 1, 2012 (collectively, the " _TAL SEC Documents_ ") in a timely
manner. None of the Subsidiaries of TAL is required to make or makes any
filings with the SEC.

 



 

(b) Each TAL SEC Document (i) as of its respective date of being furnished or
filed with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amended or superseding filing) complied with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to such TAL SEC Document and (ii) did not at the time it was so furnished or
filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as
of the date of such amended or superseding filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, in each
case, as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a TAL Material Adverse Effect. The
consolidated financial statements of TAL included in TAL SEC Documents
(including the related notes thereto) (x) complied as to form in all material
respects, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, with all the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (y) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) throughout
the periods involved (except as may be disclosed therein) and (z) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of TAL
and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the income, comprehensive income,
stockholders equity and cash flows of TAL and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates and for the respective periods set forth therein. The books
and records of TAL and its Subsidiaries are accurate and complete in all
material respects, have been maintained in all material respects in accordance
with sound business practices and accurately present and reflect in all
material respects all of the transactions and actions therein described and
the consolidated financial statements of TAL have been prepared in accordance
with such books and records. No financial statements of any Person other than
TAL and its consolidated Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in
the consolidated financial statements of TAL. TAL has not, between September
30, 2015 and the date hereof, made or adopted any material change in its
accounting methods, practices or policies in effect on September 30, 2015.

 



 

(c) TAL has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph (e) of Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act. TALs disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by TAL in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to TALs management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. TALs
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of TALs
disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, presented in any applicable TAL SEC Document that is a report on Form
10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and

 



      
 

 



 

procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. TAL has made available to Triton true and complete
copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since
January 1, 2012 and prior to the date hereof relating to the TAL SEC Documents
and all written responses of TAL thereto prior to the date hereof, other than
with respect to requests for confidential treatment or which are otherwise
publicly available on EDGAR. To the Knowledge of TAL, there are no outstanding
or unresolved comments in comment letters received prior to the date hereof
from the SEC staff with respect to any TAL SEC Documents and none of the TAL
SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review. As of the date hereof,
there are no internal investigations with respect to which TAL has retained
outside counsel, SEC inquiries or investigations or other governmental
inquiries or investigations, to the Knowledge of TAL, pending or threatened,
in each case regarding any accounting practices of TAL. Since January 1, 2012,
neither TAL nor its independent auditors have identified (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by TAL and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
TALs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,
(iii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves TALs management or
other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or
TALs internal control over financial reporting, or (iv) through the date
hereof, any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. Neither TAL
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of TAL, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant, consultant or representative of TAL or any of
its Subsidiaries has, since January 1, 2012 through the date hereof, received
written notice of any substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that TAL or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices.

the date hereof, (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business

whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise).

 



 

Section 4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except for the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) since December 31, 2014 and prior to the
date hereof, (i) each of TAL and its Subsidiaries has conducted its business
in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with past practices
and, (ii) neither TAL nor its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken
during the Interim Period, would require the prior written consent of Triton
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 6.1_ and (b) since December 31, 2014,
there has not occurred any event that has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TAL Material Adverse Effect.

certificates, licenses, variances, exemptions, authorizations, clearances,
billings and approvals of Governmental Entities (" _Permits_ ") required under
applicable Laws to carry on their businesses as currently conducted and use
their properties and assets as presently used. Since January 1, 2012, TAL and
its Subsidiaries have been in compliance in all material respects with all
Permits and all applicable Laws. Each Permit held by TAL or any of its
Subsidiaries is valid, subsisting and in full force and effect, except where
the failure to have or maintain any such Permit, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a TAL
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there are no actions pending
or, to the Knowledge of TAL, threatened, that seek the revocation,
cancellation or modification of any Permit, except where such revocation,
cancellation or modification, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have, a TAL Material Adverse Effect. Since January
1, 2012 through the date hereof, neither TAL nor its Subsidiaries has received
written notice of any charge, claim or assertion alleging any violations of or
noncompliance with any Permit, nor to the Knowledge of TAL, has any charge,
claim or assertion been threatened, except where such notice, charge, claim or
assertion, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a TAL Material Adverse Effect. This _Section
4.9(a)_ does not relate to (x) ERISA or other Laws regarding employee benefit
matters, which are governed exclusively by _Section 4.14_, (y) tax Laws,
which are governed exclusively by _Section 4.11_ or (z) Anti-Corruption Laws
and Export Control Laws, which are governed exclusively by _Section 4.24_.

 



 

(b) Since January 1, 2012, the businesses of TAL and its Subsidiaries have not
been conducted in violation of any Law, and the assets owned or used by TAL
and its Subsidiaries have been owned or used in compliance with all applicable
Laws, except, in each case, for violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be material to TAL and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. As of the date hereof, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with
respect to TAL or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of
TAL, threatened in writing. Since January 1, 2012 through the date hereof,
neither TAL nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written communication
from a Governmental Entity that alleges that TAL or any of its Subsidiaries is
not in compliance with any Law, except where any such non-compliance,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to TAL or its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, (a) there is no
claim, suit, action, investigation or proceeding at law or in equity pending
or, to the Knowledge of TAL, threatened in writing, against TAL or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) related to or potentially involving more than $1,000,000,
(ii) seeking any material equitable relief, (iii) that could result in
criminal liability, (iv) that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material impairment to the right or ability of TAL or its Subsidiaries to
carry on their operations, activities or businesses as now conducted or (v)
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially
impede TALs ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) there is no judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or Order of any Governmental Entity outstanding against TAL
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Each TAL Material Contract is valid and in full force and effect, except
where such failure to be in full force and effect has not had, and would not
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a TAL Material Adverse
Effect. TAL has provided or made available to Triton correct and complete
copies of each written TAL Material Contract prior to the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent a TAL Material Contract is with
one of TALs top twenty (20) customers (measured by dollar volume of spending
by the customer during the twelve (12) months ended September 30, 2015), a
correct and complete copy of such Atlantic Material Contract has been provided
or made available prior to the date hereof only to Tritons outside counsel.
As of the date of this Agreement, neither TAL nor any of its Subsidiaries has,
and to the Knowledge of TAL, none of the other parties thereto have, violated
any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or
condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a default under the provisions of, any TAL Material Contract,
except in each case for those violations and defaults that have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
TAL Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Container Files_.

 



 

(a) TAL has made available to Triton an electronic file in the TAL data room
No. 4.9 titled "Data Tape Sept. 2015 w UTE detail" (the " _TAL File_ ").
Except for such inaccuracies that would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the financial position of
TAL and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TALs

 



      
 

 



 

and its Subsidiaries ability to operate in all material respects in the
manner they have operated prior to the date hereof, the information set forth
in the TAL File is true and correct as of the date thereof.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair the financial position of TAL and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TALs and its Subsidiaries ability to
operate in all material respects in the manner they have operated prior to the
date hereof, (i) to the Knowledge of TAL, (A) each of the container lease
agreements that TAL or any of its Subsidiaries are currently party to with
their respective lessees constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the contractual counterparties that are a party thereto, in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and (B) other than
late payments under lease agreements consistent with past practice, none of
the contractual counterparties to any such container lease agreements is in
material breach or default thereunder (or with notice or lapse of time or both
would be in material breach or default there under), (ii) TAL and its
Subsidiaries have all right, title and interest in and to, subject to
Permitted Liens, the containers, including those subject to such container
lease agreements, owned by TAL or any of its Subsidiaries and any containers
acquired by TAL or any of its Subsidiaries after September 30, 2015 (other
than containers sold or otherwise disposed of after September 30, 2015 in the
ordinary course of business) and (iii) neither TAL nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by any container lease agreement that would require any
consent or approval of any third party to (A) any assignment of such lease
agreement to any Affiliate of TAL or (B) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or would result in any breach of, or constitute a default
(or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default) under, such agreement if such consent or approval were not obtained.
The cancellation or termination of any container lease agreements for which
TAL or any of its Subsidiaries have received a written cancellation or
termination notice from the applicable lessee prior to the date of this
Agreement would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair the financial position of TAL and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TALs and its Subsidiaries ability to
operate in all material respects in the manner they have operated prior to the
date hereof. As of November 9, 2015, the aggregate outstanding commitment of
TAL and its Subsidiaries with respect to the purchase of containers is not
more than $100,000,000.

 



 

Section 4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.14(a)_ of the TAL Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all material TAL Employee
Benefit Plans.

 



 

(b) With respect to each TAL Employee Benefit Plan, TAL has made available to
Triton a true and correct copy of each of the following documents, as
applicable: (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the
Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), (ii) the plan documents comprising such
TAL Employee Benefit Plan, including any and all amendments thereto, (iii)
each trust agreement, insurance contract or other funding agreement

 



      
 

 



 

relating to such TAL Employee Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan
description required by ERISA, (v) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation relating to a TAL Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
and (vi) the most recent determination, opinion or advisory letter issued by
the IRS with respect to any TAL Employee Benefit Plan qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code.

 



 

(c) _Section 4.14(c)_ of the TAL Disclosure Letter identifies each TAL
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _TAL Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS
has issued a favorable determination or opinion letter with respect to each
TAL Qualified Plan to the effect that it is so qualified, and no events have
occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
qualification.

 



 

(d) Each TAL Employee Benefit Plan was established and has been administered
in accordance with its terms and in compliance with applicable Laws, including
ERISA and the Code, in all material respects. As of the date hereof, there is
no material claim, suit, action, investigation or proceeding at law or in
equity pending or, to the Knowledge of TAL, threatened against, TAL or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) with
respect to any TAL Employee Benefit Plan by any current or former employee,
officer, director, participant or beneficiary of TAL or any of its
Subsidiaries or by any Governmental Entity.

 



 

(e) No TAL Employee Benefit Plan is (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
Multiemployer Plan or (iii) a plan described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.
Neither TAL nor any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) under
common control with TAL within the meaning of Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or
which together with TAL is treated as a single employer under Section 414(t)
of the Code (each, a " _TAL ERISA Affiliate_ "), currently has, or in the past
six (6) years had, an obligation to contribute to a "defined benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension plan subject to the funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or a
Multiemployer Plan and no material liability under Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA has been incurred by TAL or any TAL ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that could reasonably be expected

date hereof, (i) to the Knowledge of Triton, (A) each of the container lease
agreements that Triton or any of its Subsidiaries are currently party to with
their respective lessees constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the contractual counterparties that are a party thereto, in

with respect to TAL or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to other
information supplied by TAL or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the

call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _TAL
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Required TAL Vote
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Unless it is
permitted to make a Change in TAL Recommendation (as defined below) pursuant
to _Section 7.4(b)_, TAL shall use reasonable best efforts consistent with
customary practice to solicit the approval of its stockholders of the matters
comprising the Required TAL Vote and the Board of Directors of TAL shall
recommend approval of the matters comprising the Required TAL Vote by the
stockholders of TAL to give the Required TAL Vote (the " _TAL Recommendation_
") and shall not (nor shall any committee thereof) (w) withdraw or withhold
(or propose to withdraw or withhold) such recommendation or qualify or modify
(or propose to qualify or modify) in any manner adverse to Triton such
recommendation, (x) fail to include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (y) in the event any tender offer or exchange offer for shares of
TAL Common Stock is commenced, fail to publish, send or provide to the
Stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act and within ten
(10) Business Days after such tender offer or exchange offer is first
commenced, or subsequently amended in any material respect (or in the event
that TAL has delivered a written notice of a TAL Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event in accordance with _Section 7.4(b)_ and the applicable time
periods contemplated by _Section 7.4(b)_ would extend beyond such ten (10)
Business Day period, within two (2) Business Days following the time at which
such periods have expired), a statement recommending that its stockholders
reject such tender offer or exchange offer and publicly affirming the TAL
Recommendation or (z) adopt, approve, enter into or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve, enter into or recommend, any letter of intent,
definitive agreement, commitment, agreement in principle or other agreement
with respect to any TAL Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing actions, a
" _Change in TAL Recommendation_ "). TAL shall not adjourn or postpone the TAL
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Triton; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, TAL may adjourn or postpone the TAL Stockholders Meeting (i) after
consultation with Triton, and with Tritons prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if as of the
time for which TAL Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of TAL Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting or
to obtain the Required TAL Vote (such adjournment or postponement to be for no
more than twenty (20) Business Days and shall be to no later than the date
three (3) Business Days before the End Date), (ii) after consultation with
Triton, to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that TAL has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary or advisable under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by TAL stockholders prior to TAL Stockholders
Meeting (such adjournment or postponement shall be to no later than the date
three (3) Business Days before

 



      
 

 



 

the End Date) or (iii) if TAL has delivered a written notice of a TAL Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event in accordance with _Section 7.4(b)_ and the
applicable time periods contemplated by _Section 7.4(b)_ for revisions to
this Agreement would extend beyond TAL Stockholders Meeting, until the date
that is five (5) Business Days following the time at which such time periods
have expired (or, if earlier, the date three (3) Business Days before the End
Date). Without the prior written consent of Triton, the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the TAL Merger) and approval of proposals related thereto shall be
the only matters which TAL shall propose to be acted on by its stockholders at
the TAL Stockholders Meeting. TAL shall establish a record date for purposes
of determining the holders of TAL Common Stock entitled to notice of and vote
at the TAL Stockholders Meeting (the " _TAL Record Date_ ") on or prior to the
date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to its stockholders in accordance
with _Section 7.1(a)_. Once established, TAL shall not change the TAL Record
Date or establish a different record date for the TAL Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Triton, unless the TAL Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is
required to do so by applicable Law or pursuant to the TAL Charter or the TAL
Bylaws. In the event that the date of the TAL Stockholders Meeting as
originally called is for any reason postponed or adjourned or otherwise
delayed in accordance with this _Section 7.1(d)_, TAL agrees that, unless
Triton shall have otherwise approved in writing, it shall implement such
postponement or adjournment or other delay in such a way that TAL does not
establish a new record date for the TAL Stockholders Meeting, as so postponed,
adjourned or delayed, except as required by applicable Law, the TAL Charter or
the TAL Bylaws. TAL shall, upon the request of Triton, advise Triton
periodically (and at least on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7)
Business Days prior to the date of the TAL Stockholders Meeting) as to the
aggregate tally of the proxies received by TAL with respect to the Required
TAL Vote. Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to and in
accordance with _Article IX_, and notwithstanding any Change in TAL
Recommendation or the existence of any TAL Acquisition Proposal, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of TAL Common Stock for the
purpose of obtaining the Required TAL Vote.

 



 

(e) Triton shall, in accordance with the bye-laws of Triton, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as
practicable (and in any event such meeting shall be held within twenty (20)
days) following the date hereof (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _Triton Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Triton Shareholder Approval with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Triton shall not adjourn or postpone the Triton
Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of TAL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Triton may adjourn or postpone the Triton Shareholders Meeting,
after consultation with TAL, to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Triton
has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is required under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by Triton shareholders prior to Triton Shareholders
Meeting. Without the prior written consent of TAL, the approval of the
Statutory Merger Agreement and matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Triton Merger) shall be the only matters
which Triton shall propose to be acted on by its shareholders at the Triton
Shareholders Meeting. Triton shall establish a record date for

 



      
 

 



 

purposes of determining the holders of Triton Common Shares entitled to notice
of and vote at the Triton Shareholders Meeting (the " _Triton Record Date_ ")
on or prior to the date on which the notice of meeting is sent to the holders
of Triton Common Shares. Once established, Triton shall not change the Triton
Record Date or establish a different record date for the Triton Shareholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of TAL, unless the Board of
Directors of Triton determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so by applicable Law or
pursuant to the bye-laws of Triton. In the event that the date of the Triton
Shareholders Meeting as originally called is for any reason postponed or
adjourned or otherwise delayed in accordance with this _Section 7.1(e)_,
Triton agrees that, unless TAL shall have otherwise approved in writing, it
shall implement such postponement or adjournment or other delay in such a way
that Triton does not establish a new record date for the Triton Shareholders
Meeting, as so postponed, adjourned or delayed, except as required by
applicable Law or the bye-laws of Triton.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law, during
regular business hours and upon reasonable notice, each of Triton and TAL
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to each other
and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors, accountants and other agents and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ "), reasonable access upon reasonable prior notice during
the Interim Period to all their respective offices, facilities, properties,
assets, management-level employees and books and records and, during the
Interim Period, Triton and TAL shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other such financial, Tax and
operating data and other information with respect to such entities and their
respective business, properties, operations and personnel as Triton or TAL may
reasonably request. Any such access or disclosure pursuant to this _Section
7.2(a)_ shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of Triton or TAL, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Party or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to
(i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other immunity or protection
of the institution in possession or control of such information or (ii)
contravene any applicable Law or binding Contract entered into prior to the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party or its Subsidiary, as the
case may be, shall consider in good faith any reasonable arrangement proposed
by the other Party which would allow the other Party and its Representatives
to have access to any of the information described in the foregoing _clauses
(i)_ and _(ii)_ without causing, as applicable, a breach of any attorney-
client privilege or other such immunity or protection, a breach of applicable
Law or a breach of any such binding Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Party shall be required to disclose personnel records relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories, or other
information, the disclosure of which would violate applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Triton shall hold, and cause its Representatives to keep, any Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)

 



      
 

 



 

relating to TAL or its Affiliates provided to them under _Section 7.2(a)_ in
confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. TAL
shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to keep, any Evaluation
Material relating to Triton or its Affiliates provided to them under _Section
7.2(a)_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other Parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
effect all necessary applications, notices, filings and other documents and to
obtain as promptly as practicable all authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals of, or declarations or filings with, and all expirations of waiting
periods required from, any Governmental Entity, including pursuant to the HSR
Act, and all other consents, waivers, orders, approvals, permits, rulings,
authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party in order to consummate the Mergers or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party agrees to (i) (x) make as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days from
the date hereof, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and (y) make as promptly as reasonably practicable
such other necessary notifications and filings as are required under any
Merger Control Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby that
the Parties agree are required to be made, and (ii) supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any Merger Control Law by such
authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any Merger
Control Law and to secure any clearances and authorizations under Merger
Control Laws on or before the End Date.

 



 

(b) Each of Triton and TAL shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
_Section 7.3(a)_, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of the
status of any of the matters contemplated hereby, including providing the
other Party with a copy of any written communication (or summary of oral
communications) received by such Party from, or given by such party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission
or any other Governmental Entity and of any written communication (or summary
of oral communications) received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any such Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any such other Person, and to the extent
permitted by any such Governmental Entity or other Person,

 



      
 

 



 

give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences.

 



 

(c) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 7.3(c)_, if (i) (x) any
objection is asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act
of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
and any other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade, (y) any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding is instituted by any Governmental Entity or private party
challenging the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Law (including the HSR Act) or that would otherwise prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or (z) any Law is enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced by any Governmental Entity that would make the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, then (ii) each of TAL and
Triton shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections,
actions or proceedings so as to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall require, or be deemed to require, the
taking of any of the foregoing actions by any other Party that (1) would
require selling, swapping, holding separate, divesting or otherwise disposing
of businesses or assets of TAL and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or
Triton and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that were used in the
production of, or contributed to the production of, annual revenue in excess
of $135,592,100 in the aggregate (determined based on the gross fiscal 2014
revenue of TAL and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Triton and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand) or (2) otherwise would, or would reasonably
be expected to, have a material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations, or financial condition of the combined businesses of TAL and its
Subsidiaries and Triton and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 7.3_, if any of the events specified in _clause
(i)(y)_ of _Section 7.3(c)_ or _clause (i)(z)_ of _Section 7.3(c)_ occurs,
then each of Triton and TAL shall cooperate with each other and use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to _Section 7.3(a)_ and the last sentence of
_Section 7.3(c)_, to vigorously contest and resist any such administrative or
judicial action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any judgment, injunction or other decree or order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents,
materially delays or materially impedes the consummation of the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such Law
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Triton and TAL shall
use its reasonable best efforts to defend, at its own cost and expense, any
such administrative or judicial actions or proceedings.

 



 

(e) Each of TAL, Triton and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover Law becomes
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

to this Agreement, the Mergers or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) TAL shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (and any of the
employees or directors of it or its Subsidiaries) not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage,
knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer relating to, any transaction (other than any
transaction permitted or contemplated by this Agreement) to effect a TAL

considering making a TAL Acquisition Proposal or engage in any negotiations
concerning a TAL Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) except as expressly permitted
by this _Section 7.4_, approve, recommend, execute or enter into, or propose
to approve, recommend, execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement,
option agreement or other agreement related to any TAL Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable TAL Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant
to _Section 7.4(b)(i)_) or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Nothing in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit TAL or its Board of Directors,
directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or Representative, from
informing any Person that TAL is a party to this Agreement and referring such
person to this _Section 7.4_ in response to an unsolicited inquiry. Following
the execution of this Agreement, TAL shall immediately cease, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately cease, any
discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect
to a TAL Acquisition Proposal, or any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a TAL Acquisition Proposal and shall request to have
returned promptly to TAL, or destroyed, any confidential information that has
been provided in any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, TAL and its
Board of Directors shall be permitted, (w) to the extent applicable, to comply
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2, or make any "stop-look-listen" communication
to TAL stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f), each as promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a TAL Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_
, that this _clause (w)_ shall not permit TAL or its Board of Directors to
make a Change in TAL Recommendation except as expressly permitted by _clause
(y)_ or _clause (z)_ of this _Section 7.4(b)_, (x) subject to _Section
7.4(c)_, to engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
confidential information or data and afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of TAL or any of its Subsidiaries to, any
Person in response to an unsolicited (after the date hereof) written TAL
Acquisition Proposal under circumstances not resulting from any breach by TAL
of this _Section 7.4_, (y) to effect a Change in TAL Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(g)_ in order to
enter into a binding written agreement with respect to a TAL Superior
Proposal, or (z) to effect a

not occurred, (2) TAL has complied with this _Section 7.4_ in all but
immaterial respects, (3) the Board of Directors of TAL has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor) that such TAL Acquisition Proposal constitutes a TAL Superior
Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a TAL Superior Proposal,
and (4) prior to providing any confidential information or data or access (in
each case as described in _clause (x)_ above) to any Person in connection
with a TAL Acquisition Proposal, TAL shall enter into a confidentiality
agreement with such Person having provisions as to confidentiality that are no
less favorable to TAL than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(each, an " _Acceptable TAL Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Acceptable TAL Confidentiality Agreement shall not
prohibit compliance by TAL with any of the provisions of this Agreement,
including this _Section 7.4_, and such confidentiality agreement shall not be
required to contain standstill provisions or provide for an exclusive right to
negotiate with TAL;

 



 

(ii) in the case of _clause (y)_ above, (1) the TAL Stockholders Meeting has
not occurred, (2) TAL has complied with this _Section 7.4_ in all but
immaterial respects, (3) the Board of Directors of TAL has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside its outside legal counsel and its

Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, has
determined in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of TAL under
applicable Law, (4) TAL has notified Triton in writing, at least seven (7)
Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect such action (which notice
shall specify the identity of the Person making the TAL Superior Proposal and
the material terms and conditions thereof and include an unredacted copy of
the proposed transaction agreements (including those relating to financing));
_provided_ , _however_ , that such notice shall be given again in the event of
any revision to the financial terms or other material terms of such TAL
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that such subsequent seven (7)
Business Day notice period shall be shortened to the longer of three (3)
Business Days and the time remaining on the prior notice period if the only
change to the material terms of such TAL Superior Proposal is a change of
price, (5) prior to taking such action, if requested by Triton, TAL has, and
has caused its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Triton in good
faith to enable Triton to propose in writing revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that such TAL Acquisition Proposal would no
longer constitute a TAL Superior Proposal, and (6) following the end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors of TAL shall have considered in good
faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Triton, and shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that notwithstanding such proposed changes,
(x) such TAL Acquisition Proposal remains a TAL Superior Proposal and (y)
failure to take such

 



      
 

 



 

action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of TAL
under applicable Law; and

 



 

(iii) in the case of _clause (z)_ above, (1) the TAL Stockholders Meeting has
not occurred, (2) the Board of Directors of TAL, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith that failure to make a
Change in TAL Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the directors of TAL under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that

Superior Proposal (which is addressed in _clause (ii)_ above), a Triton
Acquisition Proposal or a Triton Superior Proposal, (3) TAL has notified
Triton in writing, at least seven (7) Business Days in advance, of its
intention to effect a Change in TAL Recommendation (which notice shall include

TAL Recommendation, if requested by Triton, TAL has, and has caused its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Triton in good faith to enable
Triton to propose in writing revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for making such Change
in TAL Recommendation, and (5) following the end of such notice period, the
Board of Directors of TAL shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement proposed in writing by Triton, and shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
notwithstanding such proposed changes, the failure to make a Change in TAL
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
directors of TAL under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) TAL shall notify Triton as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) of any TAL Acquisition
Proposal received after the date hereof by TAL or any of its Representatives,
orally and in writing, indicating, in connection with such notice, the

Acquisition Proposal (including an unredacted copy thereof if in writing). TAL
agrees that it will keep Triton promptly and reasonably apprised, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status of any discussions or negotiations in
respect thereof (including whether the TAL Acquisition Proposal is withdrawn
or rejected) and any changes to the material terms and conditions of any such
TAL Acquisition Proposal, and in any event TAL shall provide Triton with
written notice of any material development with respect to any of the
foregoing as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours of receipt) after such development occurs, including the fact
that TAL has engaged in any discussions (other than discussions for a period
of up to five (5) days in order to clarify the terms of such TAL Acquisition
Proposal prior to engaging in negotiations with, entering into a
confidentiality agreement with or furnishing any non-public information to
such TAL Bidder) or negotiations with, or has furnished any non-public
information to, a TAL Bidder. TAL also agrees to provide Triton with any
information, data or access that it provides to the third party making the
request therefor substantially contemporaneously with providing such
information to such third party, unless Triton has already been provided with
such information.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Triton shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (and any of the
employees or directors of it or its Subsidiaries) not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage,
knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer relating to, any transaction (other than any
transaction permitted or contemplated by this Agreement) to effect a Triton
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) except as expressly permitted by this _Section
7.4_, have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or

agreement related to any Triton Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Triton Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to _Section 7.4(e)_)
or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Nothing in this _Section 7.4_
shall prohibit Triton or its Board of Directors, directly or indirectly
through any officer, employee or Representative, from informing any Person
that Triton is a party to this Agreement and referring such person to this
_Section 7.4_ in response to an unsolicited inquiry. Following the execution
of this Agreement, Triton shall immediately cease, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately cease, any
discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect
to a Triton Acquisition Proposal, or any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Triton Acquisition Proposal and shall request to have
returned promptly to Triton, or destroyed, any confidential information that
has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) the TAL
Board determines that a TAL Acquisition Proposal from a third party bidder (a
" _TAL Bidder_ ") either constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a TAL Superior Proposal and engages in discussions (other than discussions
for a period of up to five (5) days in order to clarify the terms of such TAL
Acquisition Proposal prior to engaging in negotiations with, entering into a
confidentiality agreement with or furnishing any non-public information
regarding TALs or its Subsidiaries business to such TAL Bidder) or
negotiations with, or furnishes non-public information regarding TALs or its
Subsidiaries business to, such TAL Bidder, (ii) the TAL Stockholders Meeting
has not occurred, (iii) Triton has complied with this _Section 7.4_ in all
but immaterial respects, (iv) the Board of Directors of Triton has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) that a Triton Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Triton
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Triton Superior
Proposal, and (v) prior to providing any confidential information or data or
access to any Person in connection with a Triton Acquisition Proposal, Triton
shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with such Person having
provisions as to confidentiality that are no less favorable to Triton than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Acceptable
Triton Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Acceptable Triton Confidentiality Agreement shall not prohibit compliance by
Triton with any of the provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section
7.4_, and such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to contain
standstill provisions or provide for an exclusive right to negotiate with
Triton, then Triton and its Board of Directors shall be permitted, subject to
_Section 7.4(g)_,

 



      
 

 



 

to engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any confidential
information or data and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of Triton or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person in
response to an unsolicited (after the date hereof) written Triton Acquisition
Proposal under circumstances not resulting from any breach by Triton of this
_Section 7.4_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (i) the TAL
Board determines that a TAL Acquisition Proposal from a TAL Bidder either
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a TAL Superior Proposal
and engages in discussions (other than discussions for a period of up to five
(5) days in order to clarify the terms of such TAL Acquisition Proposal prior
to engaging in negotiations with, entering into a confidentiality agreement
with or furnishing any non-public information regarding TALs or its
Subsidiaries business to such TAL Bidder) or negotiations with, or furnishes
non-public information regarding TALs or its Subsidiaries business to, such
TAL Bidder, (ii) the TAL Stockholders Meeting has not occurred, (iii) Triton
has complied with this _Section 7.4_ in all but immaterial respects and (iv)
the Board of Directors of Triton has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
that a Triton Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Triton Superior Proposal,
then Triton may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(d)_
in order to enter into a binding written agreement with respect to a Triton
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that Triton may not terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(d)_ unless and until (A) Triton has
notified TAL in writing, at least seven (7) Business Days in advance, of its
intention to effect such action (which notice shall specify the identity of
the Person making the Triton Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof and include an unredacted copy of the proposed transaction
agreements (including those relating to financing)); _provided_ ; _further_ ,
that such notice shall be given again in the event of any revision to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Triton Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that such subsequent seven (7) Business
Day notice period shall be shortened to the longer of three (3) Business Days
and the time remaining on the prior notice period if the only change to the
material terms of such Triton Superior Proposal is a change of price, (B)
prior to taking such action, if requested by TAL, Triton has, and has caused
its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with TAL in good faith to
enable TAL to propose in writing revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Triton Acquisition Proposal would no longer
constitute a Triton Superior Proposal and (C) following the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of Triton shall have considered in good faith
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by TAL, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, that notwithstanding such proposed changes, such
Triton Acquisition Proposal remains a Triton Superior Proposal.

 



 

(g) Triton shall notify TAL as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) of any Triton Acquisition
Proposal received after the date hereof by Triton or any of its
Representatives, orally and in writing, indicating, in connection with such
notice, the identity of such Person and the material terms and conditions of
any such Triton Acquisition Proposal (including an unredacted copy thereof if
in writing). Triton agrees that it will keep TAL promptly and reasonably
apprised, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of any discussions or
negotiations in respect thereof (including

 



      
 

 



 

whether the Triton Acquisition Proposal is withdrawn or rejected) and any
changes to the material terms and conditions of any such Triton Acquisition
Proposal, and in any event Triton shall provide TAL with written notice of any
material development with respect to any of the foregoing as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
receipt) after such development occurs. Triton also agrees to provide TAL with
any information, data or access that it provides to the third party making the
request therefor substantially contemporaneously with providing such
information to such third party, unless TAL has already been provided with
such information.

 



 

(h) Neither TAL nor Triton shall, and each of TAL and Triton shall cause each
of its respective Subsidiaries (and any of the employees or directors of it or
its respective Subsidiaries) not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, enter into any exclusivity or similar arrangements that would
prevent the other Party from entering into an agreement with respect to, or
consummating, a TAL Acquisition Proposal or a Triton Acquisition Proposal, as
the case may be.

to cause the Holdco Common Shares to be issued in the Mergers to, prior to
Closing, be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to (i) official notice
of issuance and (ii) in the case of the Holdco Common Shares to be issued in
the Triton Merger, the removal of any restrictive legends. If the Holdco
Common Shares to be issued in the Triton Merger are not approved for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance and the removal of any
restrictive legends, prior to the Closing, Holdco shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause such Holdco Common Shares to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to the removal of any restrictive legends, on or prior to the
six (6) month anniversary of the Closing.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, TAL and Triton
shall each take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
TAL Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to TAL Common
Stock) or acquisitions of Holdco Common Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to Holdco Common Shares) resulting from the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to TAL or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Holdco, immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Mergers are consummated,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such

Section 7.8 _Public Announcements_. Triton and TAL shall use reasonable best
efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all
press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan
and (c) except in respect of any announcement relating to any Change in TAL
Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement, as required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange in which it is impracticable to consult with
each other as contemplated by this _clause (c)_ , to consult with each other
and receive the written approval of the other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing _clause (c)_ ,
each of Triton and TAL may make any public statement in response to specific
questions posed by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls so long as such statements
are substantially similar to previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by Triton and TAL (or by any of them
individually, if approved by the other in advance as contemplated by this
_Section 7.8_).

 



 

Section 7.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest Holdco or the Surviving Corporations with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
either of the constituent corporations of the Mergers, the proper officers and
directors of each Party shall take all such necessary action.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Merger Tax Opinion_. Triton shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a tax opinion from Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP ("
_Triton Tax Counsel_ ") to Triton, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Triton (and any similar opinion to be
attached as an exhibit to the Form S-4), substantially to the effect that for
U.S. federal income tax purposes either (a) the Triton Merger will be treated
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (b)
the Triton Merger, together with the TAL Merger and the other transactions
described in this Agreement, will be treated as a contribution of property to
Holdco in exchange for shares therein as described in Section 351 of the Code
(the " _Merger Tax Opinion_ "). Each of the Merger Subs, Holdco, Triton and
TAL shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Triton Tax Counsel for
purposes of the Merger Tax Opinion a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of
the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date the Form S-4 shall
have been declared effective by the SEC), signed by an officer of the Merger
Subs, Holdco, Triton and TAL, as applicable, and containing representations of
the Merger Subs, Holdco, Triton and TAL, as applicable, in each case, as shall
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Triton Tax Counsel to render
its Merger Tax Opinion.

and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement
of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of TAL or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request
of TAL or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,

law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses

other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on

liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other
enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such person in any
such capacity and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts
or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Triton Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Triton Effective Time, in

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the TAL Effective Time, Holdco shall,

omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by TAL (the " _Existing TAL D andO
Policy_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) Holdco may, or may cause the TAL
Surviving Corporation to, substitute therefor a policy or policies with
limits, terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in the aggregate to
the insured; (ii) neither Holdco nor the TAL Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay annual premiums for the Existing TAL DandO Policy (or for any
substitute policy or policies) in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the annual premium paid by TAL with respect to the Existing TAL DandO Policy as
of the date hereof, which is set forth in _Section 7.13_ of the TAL
Disclosure Letter (the " _TAL Insurance Amount_ "); and (iii) if such premiums
for such insurance would at any time exceed the TAL Insurance Amount, then
Holdco shall maintain, or cause the TAL Surviving Corporation to maintain,
policies of insurance that, in Holdcos good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the TAL Insurance
Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, TAL may, at its option, purchase from one or
more insurers reasonably acceptable to TAL, a single payment, run-off policy
or policies of directors and officers liability insurance covering each TAL
Indemnified Party with respect to their acts or omissions as directors and
officers of TAL and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, occurring prior to the
TAL Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) on terms and conditions, including limits, no less
favorable in the aggregate than the terms and conditions contained in the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
TAL, such policy or policies to become effective at the Effective Time and
remain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the TAL Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate premium(s) for such policy or
policies shall not exceed the TAL Insurance Amount.

respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Triton
(the " _Existing Triton D andO Policy_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i)
Holdco may, or may cause the Triton Surviving Corporation to, substitute
therefor a policy or policies with limits, terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous in the aggregate to the insured; (ii) neither Holdco nor the
Triton Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay annual premiums for the
Existing Triton DandO Policy (or for any substitute policy or policies) in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by Triton
with respect to the Existing Triton DandO Policy as of the date hereof, which is
set forth in _Section 7.13_ of the Triton Disclosure Letter (the " _Triton
Insurance Amount_ "); and (iii) if such premiums for such insurance would at
any time exceed the Triton Insurance Amount, then Holdco shall maintain, or
cause the Triton Surviving Corporation to maintain, policies of insurance

foregoing, Triton may, at its option, purchase from one or more insurers
reasonably acceptable to Triton, a single payment, run-off policy or policies
of directors and officers liability insurance covering each Triton
Indemnified Party with respect to their acts or omissions as directors and

Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate premium(s) for such policy
or policies shall not exceed the Triton Insurance Amount.

 



 

(e) If Holdco or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.13_.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each TAL Indemnified Party and Triton
Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and Representatives and (ii) are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to

shareholder litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither TAL nor Triton
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives shall compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or

not to exceed the amount set forth on _Section 6.1(o)_ of the TAL Disclosure
Letter or _Section 6.2(p)_ of the Triton Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
and the only other form of relief granted is the modification of previous
disclosure, which modification shall be reasonably acceptable to the other
Party).

Time, of any "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code) from each person who has a right to any payments and/or benefits
as a result of, or in connection with, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon occurrence of any other
event) that would be deemed to constitute "excess parachute payments";

required, in its use of reasonable best efforts, to offer any additional
compensation to any person from whom a waiver is sought pursuant to this
_clause (i)_ ; and (ii) solicit the approval of the shareholders of Triton in

of the Code of all payments and/or benefits (including payments and benefits
waived pursuant to the preceding clause) that would, as a result of, or in
connection with, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

constitute "excess parachute payments." If required to comply with the
provisions of the preceding sentence, Triton shall

 



      
 

 



 

deliver, among other items, to its shareholders a disclosure statement
intended to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. TAL shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the waivers, solicitation of approval and disclosure
statement and any analysis with respect to the "excess parachute payments"
before the waivers and shareholder approval are sought. Not less than five (5)
days prior to the Effective Time, Triton shall provide TAL with copies of the
completed and executed waivers and shareholder approval documents, to the
extent obtained.

_provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) all of the conditions to Closing, other
than the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ and/or _Section 8.1(e)_
(solely with respect to matters addressed in _Section 8.1(a)_), shall have

the latest of any of which dates shall thereafter be deemed to be the End
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement

such date;

order, decree, ruling or Injunction permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting either or both of the Mergers, and such order, decree,
ruling or Injunction has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with

without the Required TAL Vote having been obtained;

 



 

(c) by Triton, if TAL shall have effected a Change in TAL Recommendation,

(e) by Triton, if there shall have been a breach by TAL or its Subsidiaries of
any of the covenants or agreements, or a failure to be true of any of the
representations or warranties, set forth in this Agreement on the part of TAL
or its Subsidiaries, which breach, or failure to be true, either individually
or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing, the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or
_Section 8.3(b)_ and which breach, or failure to be true, has not been cured
by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following written notice thereof to TAL
or (y) the End Date or, by its nature, cannot be cured within such time
period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(e)_ shall not be available if Triton is itself in
breach of its representations, warranties or covenants such as would result in
any of the closing conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section
8.2(b)_ not being satisfied;

 



 

(f) by TAL, if there shall have been a breach by Triton or its Subsidiaries of

representations or warranties, set forth in this Agreement on the part of
Triton or its Subsidiaries, which breach, or failure to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing
on the Closing, the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_Section 8.2(b)_ and which breach, or failure to be true, has not been cured
by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following written notice thereof to
Triton or (y) the End Date or, by its nature, cannot be cured within such time
period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement

Parties specifying with particularity the reason for such termination and the
Section or Sections of this Agreement under which such termination is being

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of any Party or its respective officers or directors,
except with respect to _Section 7.2_ (Access to Information;
Confidentiality), _Section 7.7_ (Fees and Expenses), this _Section 9.2_
(Effect of Termination), and _Article X_ (General Provisions), which shall
survive such termination, and except that no Party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages

 



      
 

 



 

(which the Parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement
of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and, in the case of liabilities or damages
payable by Triton and Holdco, would include the benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement lost by TALs stockholders, and, in the case of
liabilities or damages payable by TAL, would include the benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement lost by Tritons shareholders)
incurred or suffered by the other Party arising out of the Willful and
Material Breach of its covenants contained in this Agreement or fraud.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) (A) a third party shall have publicly made a TAL Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement, (B) this Agreement is subsequently
terminated by TAL or Triton pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ (but only if the
TAL Stockholders Meeting has not been held prior to the End Date) or _Section
9.1(b)(iii)_ and such TAL Acquisition Proposal was not publicly irrevocably
withdrawn at least three (3) Business Day prior to the date of the TAL
Stockholders Meeting, and (C) within nine (9) months of such termination of
this Agreement, TAL consummates any TAL Acquisition Proposal or enters into
any definitive agreement with respect to any TAL Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of _clause (C)_ of _Section
9.2(b)(i)_, the references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of TAL
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to fifty percent (50%);

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Triton pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_; or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by TAL pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_,

 



 

then TAL shall pay to Triton the sum of $19,484,275 (the " _TAL Termination
Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds (A) in the case of
_clause (i)_ above, no later than two (2) Business Days following the date of
the consummation of such transaction involving a TAL Acquisition Proposal or
entry into a definitive agreement with respect to a TAL Acquisition Proposal,
(B) in the case of _clause (ii)_ above, no later than two (2) Business Days
after the date of such termination, and (C) in the case of _clause (iii)_
above, prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; it being
understood that in no event shall TAL be required to pay the TAL Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Triton pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)_, then Triton shall pay to TAL the sum of $65,000,000 (the "
_Triton Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds
prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; it being
understood that in no event shall Triton be required to pay the Triton
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by TAL or Triton pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ (but only if the TAL Stockholders Meeting has not been held prior
to the End Date, other than if the failure by Triton, Holdco or the Merger
Subs to comply with any

 



      
 

 



 

provision of this Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of the
TAL Stockholders Meeting to have been held prior to the End Date) or _Section
9.1(b)(iii)_, TAL shall reimburse Triton, no later than two (2) Business Days
after presentation to TAL of an itemized invoice, for all documented out-of-
pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by Triton, Holdco, the Merger Subs
and their respective Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
aggregate amount of such expenses TAL is required to reimburse Triton shall
not exceed $3,500,000, (ii) if TAL becomes obligated to pay the TAL
Termination Fee after having made any payment pursuant to this _Section
9.2(d)_, then the amount of the TAL Termination Fee shall be reduced by the
amount of such payments pursuant to this _Section 9.2(d)_ and (iii) if TAL
has paid the TAL Termination Fee, then it shall have no obligation under this
_Section 9.2(d)_ from and after such payment.

 



 

(e) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are integral parts of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if TAL fails to pay all amounts due to Triton on the
dates specified in _Section 9.2(b)_ and/or _Section 9.2(d)_, then TAL shall
pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by
Triton in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of
any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with
interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such
time, as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus five percent (5%) from the
date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by
Triton, and if Triton fails to pay all amounts due to TAL on the dates
specified in _Section 9.2(c)_, then Triton shall pay all costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by TAL in connection with any
action or proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to
collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at
the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in The Wall
Street Journal, plus five percent (5%) from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by TAL. Each of the
Parties acknowledges that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 9.2_
is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the other Party in the circumstances in which such payments
are due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no payment of the TAL Termination Fee or the Triton Termination Fee shall
be considered in lieu of, or a replacement or substitution for, damages in the
event of any Willful and Material Breach or fraud.

 



 

(f) Except in the case of a Willful and Material Breach or fraud, each Party
agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) in
the event that the TAL Termination Fee becomes payable and is actually paid to
Triton in accordance with this _Section 9.2_, the payment of such TAL
Termination Fee (and any amounts payable under _Section 9.2(e)_) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Triton, Holdco, the Merger Subs, and their
respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees and Representatives against TAL or any of its Representatives or
Affiliates for and (B) in no event will Triton, Holdco or the Merger Subs or
their respective Subsidiaries seek to recover any other money damages or seek
any other remedy based on a claim at law or in equity with respect to, in

 



      
 

 



 

the case of each of _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , (1) any loss suffered, directly
or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated,
(2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations
arising under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or
relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement, and
(C) upon payment of any TAL Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section
9.2_ (and any amounts payable under _Section 9.2(e)_), neither TAL nor any of
its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or
obligation to Triton, Holdco, the Merger Subs or any of their respective
Subsidiaries relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(g) Except in the case of a Willful and Material Breach or fraud, each Party
agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) in
the event that the Triton Termination Fee becomes payable and is actually paid
to TAL in accordance with this _Section 9.2_, the payment of such Triton
Termination Fee (and any amounts payable under _Section 9.2(e)_) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of TAL and its Subsidiaries, stockholders,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives against Triton,
Holdco, the Merger Subs or any of their respective Representatives or
Affiliates for and (B) in no event will TAL or any of its Subsidiaries seek to
recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim at
law or in equity with respect to, in the case of each of _clauses (A)_ and
_(B)_ , (1) any loss suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the
failure of the Mergers to be consummated, (2) the termination of this
Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or
(4) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach,
termination or failure of or under this Agreement, and (C) upon payment of any
Triton Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.2_ (and any amounts
payable under _Section 9.2(e)_), neither Triton nor Holdco nor the Merger
Subs nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation to TAL or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information referred to has been made available by a Party to the Party whom
such information is to be made available. The phrases "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" shall be inclusive
and not exclusive. Any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neuter forms.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(including by electronic means), each of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and this Agreement shall become effective when a counterpart
signed by each Party shall be delivered to the other Party, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Shareholder Agreements, the Triton
Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (b)
is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder, except (i) the TAL Indemnified Parties and the Triton
Indemnified Parties as provided in _Section 7.13_ (which is intended for the
benefit of only the Persons specifically named therein) and (ii) following the
Effective Time, the rights of holders of TAL Common Stock, TAL Stock Options,
Restricted TAL Shares and Triton Common Shares, Triton Stock Options and
Restricted Triton Shares to receive the Merger Consideration or other
consideration, as applicable.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Mergers shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the Laws of any other jurisdiction that might be
applied because of the conflicts of Law principles of the State of Delaware
(except that provisions of this Agreement relating to the approval and effects
of the Triton Merger, the conversion of shares in the Triton Merger, and any
other matters relating to the internal corporate governance of Triton, Holdco
or the Triton Merger Sub, in each case to which mandatory provisions of the
law of Bermuda otherwise apply, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with such provisions of, the law of Bermuda, as the case may be).

 



 

Section 10.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement (other
than _Section 9.2_) that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or
unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of
the economic benefits of the Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining
therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any
of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement (other than _Section 9.2_) is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. In any such case, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a
mutually acceptable manner to the end that the terms of this Agreement are
able to be fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. For the avoidance of
doubt, the agreements contained in _Section 9.2_ are integral parts of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be severable.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties shall be assigned by either Party
(whether by operation of

 



      
 

 



 

law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party, and
any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or,
if the Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction, any court of the
State of Delaware or of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance
with the immediately following sentence, and irrevocably waive the defense of
an inconvenient forum or an improper venue to the maintenance of any such
action or proceeding. Any service of process to be made in such action or
proceeding shall be made by delivery of process in accordance with the notice
provisions contained in _Section 10.2_ or in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 10.9_
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
_Section 10.9_ and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the Parties. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. In
addition, each of the Parties agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary
damages) to seek (on behalf of themselves and the third-party beneficiaries of
this Agreement) (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an
injunction, restraining such breach or threatened breach. No Party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.10_, and each Party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY INVOLVING ANY MATTERS
(WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION

 



      
 

 



 

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (B) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (C) SUCH PARTY
MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with this
Agreement by the stockholders of TAL and the shareholders of Triton, but,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires
further approval by such stockholders or shareholders, as the case may be,
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. Neither Holdco
nor Triton nor TAL shall agree to any amendment, modification, or termination
of, or the granting of any waiver under, any of the Ancillary Agreements
without the prior written consent of both TAL and Triton.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors or similar governing body, may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of any other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of a Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any
waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or
other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

7. **Effect of Triton Merger on Share Capital**

 



 

7.1 At the Triton Effective, Time by virtue of the Triton Merger and without
any action on the part of Holdco, Bermuda Sub or Triton or the holder of any
share capital of Holdco, Triton or Bermuda Sub:

 



 

(a) each class A voting share of Triton, of par value US$0.01 per class A
voting share ( **Triton Class A Common Shares**) and each class B non-voting
share of Triton of par value US$0.01 per class B non-voting share ( **Triton
Class B Common Shares**, and together with the Triton Class A Common Shares,
**Triton Common Shares** ), issued immediately before the Triton Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) except as otherwise set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, each
Triton Common Share issued immediately prior to the Triton Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a number of fully
paid and non-assessable common shares of par value US$0.01 each in the capital
of Holdco ( **Holdco Common Shares** ) equal to the Triton Exchange Ratio
together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional Holdco Common Shares at the
rate determined under Section 3.2(g) of the Transaction Agreement (the
**Triton Merger Consideration** );

 



 

(ii) all Triton Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, converted into the right to receive the Triton
Merger Consideration, and any holder of Triton Dissenting Shares shall, in the
event that the fair value of a Triton Dissenting Share (as appraised by the
Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act (the
**Appraised Fair Value** )) is greater than the Triton Merger Consideration
shall be entitled to receive such difference from Triton by payment made
within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined
pursuant to such appraisal procedure;

 



 

(iii) all issued Triton Common Shares subject to vesting or other lapse
restrictions under any Triton Stock Plan immediately prior to the Triton
Effective Time shall cease to represent Triton Common Shares and shall be
cancelled and converted into a number of Holdco Common Shares equal to the
Triton Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole number) (each, a **Triton
Restricted Holdco Share** ), with such Triton Restricted Holdco Shares subject
to the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were
applicable to such Triton Restricted Holdco Shares immediately prior to the
Triton Effective Time (after taking into account any acceleration of vesting
that results from the Mergers); and

 



 

(iv) all issued Triton Common Shares held by Triton as treasury shares or that
are owned by Triton or Bermuda Sub, in each case immediately prior to the
Triton Effective Time, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist without any conversion thereof or any payment of capital in respect
thereof, and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor; and

 



 

(b) each common share in Bermuda Sub in issue immediately before the Triton
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled, without any further action on
the part of Bermuda Sub, and converted into one, fully paid and non-assessable
common share, par value US$0.01 per common share, of the Surviving Company.

 



 

For purposes of this Section 7.1, the **Triton Exchange Ratio** shall mean the
quotient obtained by dividing (a) the product of (i) 55/45 and (ii) 33,255,291
by (b) the **Triton Share Count** , which shall mean the sum of (a)
50,041,895.31 and (b) the number of Triton Common

 



      
 

 



 

Shares (including Restricted Triton Shares, other than any Restricted Triton
Shares issued by Triton in accordance with Section 6.2(d)(ii) of the
Transaction Agreement but only if and to the extent Triton is entitled to
issue Restricted Triton Shares under Section 6.2(d)(ii) of the Transaction
Agreement) issued to holders of Triton Stock Options following the execution
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time and (c) without duplication
of any Restricted Triton Shares included in clause (b) above, any Restricted
Triton Shares issued by Triton as contemplated by Section 6.2(d)(iii) of the
Transaction Agreement that have not been included in the number of Restricted
Triton Shares that may be issued pursuant to Section 6.2(d)(ii) of the
Transaction Agreement.

 



 

8. **Settlement of Merger Consideration**

 



 

8.1 Prior to the Effective Time, Triton shall designate Computershare Trust
Company, N.A to act as exchange agent ( **Exchange Agent** ) for the purpose
of exchanging the Triton Certificates and the Triton Book-Entry Shares for the
Triton Merger Consideration.

 



 

8.2 As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
Triton Common Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such holder representing such Former Shares, shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, or in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, for payment of the Triton Merger Consideration.

Section 1.2 _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Expiration Date, each Shareholder
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants to, and appoints, Triton and any
designee thereof as such Shareholders proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full
power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such
Shareholder, to vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written
consent, if applicable) the Shares owned by such Shareholder as of the
applicable record date in accordance with the Required Votes; _provided_ that
each Shareholders grant of the proxy contemplated by this _Section 1.2_
shall be effective if, and only if, such Shareholder has not delivered to
Triton prior to the meeting at which any of the matters described in _Section
1.1_ are to be considered a duly executed irrevocable instrument directing
that the Shares of such Shareholder be voted in accordance with the Required
Votes.

 



 

(b) Each Shareholder hereby represents that any proxies heretofore given in
respect of the Shares, if any, are revocable, and hereby revokes all such
proxies.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in
this _Section 1.2_, if it becomes effective, is given in connection with the
execution of the Transaction Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is
given to secure the performance of the duties of such Shareholder under this
Agreement. The parties hereby further affirm that the irrevocable proxy, if it
becomes effective, is coupled with an interest and is intended to be
irrevocable until the Expiration Date, at which time it will terminate
automatically. If for any reason any proxy granted herein is not irrevocable
after it becomes effective, then the Shareholder granting such proxy agrees,
until the Expiration Date, to vote its Shares in accordance with the Required
Votes. The parties agree that the foregoing is a voting agreement.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Restrictions on Transfers_. Absent the prior written consent of
TAL and Triton, each Shareholder hereby agrees that, from the date hereof

Transfer of any Shares, other than (A) (1) any Transfer made for estate
planning purposes or to a charitable institution for philanthropic purposes,
(2) any Transfer of any equity interest of a Shareholder or (3) any Transfer
to an Affiliate of such Shareholder [or to Tulip Growth PCC Limited or any of
its Affiliates],(1) [or to a Pritzker Transferee](2) but only if, in each
case, prior to the effectiveness of such Transfer, the transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the applicable terms hereof (unless such transferee is
a Shareholder or is party to any of the other Triton Voting Agreements) and
notice of such Transfer is delivered to TAL pursuant to _Section 4.3_, or (B)
a Transfer pursuant to any trust or will of such Shareholder or by the Laws of
intestate succession, (ii) deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter
into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy or power of attorney
with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement, or (iii) agree
(whether or not in writing) to take any of the actions prohibited by the
foregoing clause (i) or (ii). [As used in this Agreement, " _Pritzker
Transferee_ " shall mean (w) lineal descendants of Nicholas J. Pritzker,
deceased, and all spouses and adopted children of such descendants, (x) all
trusts for the benefit of any Person described in clause (w) and trustees of
such trusts, (y) all legal representatives of any Person described in clauses
(w) or (x), and (z) all partnerships, corporations, limited liability
companies or other entities controlling, controlled by or under common control
with any Person, trust or other entity described in clauses (w), (x) or (y),
it being understood that " _control_ ", for the purpose of this definition
only, means the ability to influence, direct or otherwise significantly affect
the major policies, activities or actions of any Person.](3) [Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.3_, no Transfer of Shares shall
be made by any Shareholder to Tulip Growth PCC Limited or any of its

Affiliates prior to the Expiration Date unless the definitions of "Change of
Control", "Change of Control Event" and "TCIL Change of Control" under each of
the debt agreements of Triton or any of its subsidiaries existing on the date
hereof have been amended such that a Transfer to such Person by any of the
Permitted Holders (as defined in such agreements), in and of itself, would not
trigger a "Change of Control", "Change of Control Event" or "TCIL Change of
Control" (as defined in such agreements), or all such debt agreements have
been terminated and have not been replaced with new debt agreements that
contain similar change of control provisions that would be triggered by a
transfer by any of the Permitted Holders.](4) Any purported Transfer of
Shares inconsistent with this _Section 1.3_ shall be null and void, and
Triton shall refuse to recognize any such Transfer for any purpose and shall
not, and shall cause Tritons corporate secretary not to, reflect in its
records any change in record ownership of Shares pursuant to any such
Transfer.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Inconsistent Agreements_. Each Shareholder hereby covenants and
agrees that, except for this Agreement, it (a) shall not enter into at any

trust with respect to the Shares that is inconsistent with this Agreement and
(b) shall not grant at any time while this Agreement remains in effect a
proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Shares that is

Agreement that has the effect of modifying any Other Shareholders voting

Shareholder with respect to the matters set forth in any Other Voting
Agreement, it will, concurrently with such consent or amendment, modification
or waiver consent to an amendment or modification of, or grant a waiver under,

right, notice right, drag-along right or other right against any Shareholder

TERMINATION

 



 

This Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or
effect on the earlier of (a) the consummation of the Mergers and (b) the
termination of the Transaction Agreement pursuant to and in compliance with

covenants set forth in _Section 2.3_ hereof in any material respect and such
breach has not been cured (if curable) within ten (10) business days following
such breach, or (ii) any Other Voting Agreement is terminated.](7) In the

injunction, restraining such breach or threatened breach. No party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 4.11_, and each party hereto

Section 4.18 _Trustee Exculpation_. When this Agreement is executed by a
trustee of a trust or by an attorney-in-fact on behalf of a trustee of a
trust, such execution is by or on behalf of the trustee, not individually, but
solely as trustee in the exercise of and under the power and authority
conferred upon and invested in such trustee, and it is expressly understood
and agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as
imposing any liability on any such trustee personally for breaches of any
representations or warranties made hereunder or to pay any amounts required to
be paid hereunder, or personally to perform any covenant, either express or
implied, contained herein. Any liability of a trust or trustee hereunder shall
not be a personal liability of any trustee, grantor or beneficiary thereof,

advancement of expenses provided by, or insurance obtained by, the Sponsor

Company, the Company hereby agrees that, with respect to its indemnification
and advancement obligations to such [Warburg Pincus Directors/Vestar Director]
under the Indemnification Agreements and/or any such other agreement or
arrangement, the Company (A) is the indemnitor of first resort ( _i.e_., its
obligations to indemnify the Director Indemnitee[s] are primary and any
obligation of the Fund Indemnitors or their insurers to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any
of the Director Indemnitee[s] is secondary and excess), (B) shall be required
to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by a Director Indemnitee and
shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties,
fines and amounts paid in settlement by a Director Indemnitee or on his or her
behalf to the extent legally permitted and as required by the Indemnification

their insurers, and (C) irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Fund
Indemnitors and such insurers from any and all claims against the Fund
Indemnitors or such insurers for contribution, by way of subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company

 



      
 

 



 

agrees that in the event that any Fund Indemnitor or its insurer should
advance any expenses or make any payment to a Director Indemnitee for matters
entitled to advancement or indemnification by the Company pursuant to an
Indemnification Agreement and/or any such other agreement or arrangement, the
Company shall promptly reimburse such Fund Indemnitor or insurer and that such
Fund Indemnitor or insurer shall be subrogated to all of the claims or rights
of such Director Indemnitee under the Indemnification Agreements and/or any
such other agreement or arrangement, including to the payment of expenses in
an action to collect. The Company agrees that any Fund Indemnitor or its
insurer not a party hereto shall be an express third party beneficiary of this
_Section 2.04(b)_, able to enforce such clause according to its terms as if
it were a party hereto. Nothing contained in the Indemnification Agreements
and/or any such other agreement or arrangement is intended to limit the scope

rights provided to any of the Sponsor Shareholders under this Agreement, each
of [the Sponsor Shareholders] and any successor thereof, and, at the written
request of a Sponsor Shareholder, each co-investor or Affiliate of a Sponsor
Shareholder that indirectly has an interest in the Company Securities through
such Sponsor Shareholder, in each case that is intended to qualify as a
"venture capital operating company" (a " _VCOC_ ") as defined in the U.S.
Department of Labor Regulations codified at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 that
beneficially owns a number of Company Shares representing at least one percent
(1%) of the number of Company Shares outstanding (as adjusted for any share
splits, share dividends, combinations, recapitalizations or the like (each, a
" _VCOC Investor_ "), may, upon the written request of such VCOC Investor,
enter into a management rights agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit I_ (each, a " _Management Rights Agreement_ "), between
the Company and each VCOC Investor, pursuant to which such VCOC Investor shall
have customary and appropriate VCOC rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company reserves the right to exclude such VCOC Investor from access to any
written materials prepared for distribution to members of the Board at
regularly scheduled Board meetings or meeting or portion thereof if the
Company believes that such exclusion is reasonably necessary to preserve the
attorney-client privilege, to protect confidential proprietary information, to
comply with regulatory restrictions, or for other similar reasons), and the
right to audited and unaudited financial statements; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall be under no obligation to provide the VCOC Investor
with any material non-public information with respect to future corporate
actions. The right of any Person to receive information or access pursuant to
a Management Rights Agreement shall be subject to such Person executing a
customary confidentiality agreement in favor of the Company and the related
Sponsor Shareholder shall, in addition to the Person executing such agreement,
be responsible for any breach thereof.

five percent (5%) of the Company Shares then issued and outstanding, each
member of the Sponsor Shareholder Group shall vote (i) 55.0% of its Company
Shares in the same proportion as the votes cast by the shareholders of the
Company who are not Sponsor Shareholders (or their Affiliates) in any election
or removal of directors (other than with respect to any contested election,
any election of a Warburg Pincus Director or a Vestar Director, any removal of
a Warburg Pincus Director or a Vestar Director or any replacement of such
directors in accordance with _Section 2.02(c)_) and (ii) all of its Company
Shares in the same proportion as the votes cast by shareholders of the Company
who are not Sponsor Shareholders (or their Affiliates) in any vote or consent
on any shareholder proposal or Extraordinary Transaction unless it is approved
by a majority of the directors on the Board and, in the case of an
Extraordinary Transaction, provides equal treatment of all Company Shares.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 2.07(a_), each member of the Sponsor Shareholder
Group agrees to take all Necessary Action, including by casting all votes to
which such Sponsor Shareholder is entitled in respect of its Company Shares,
whether at any annual or special meeting, by written consent or otherwise, so
as to cause the election, removal and replacement of directors in accordance
with _Section 2.02_ and to otherwise give the fullest effect possible to the
provisions of this _ARTICLE II_.

 



 

(c) The Company agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
applicable rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Company
Securities are listed, to include in the slate of nominees recommended by the
Board for election at any meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of
electing directors the Persons designated pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and to
nominate and recommend each such Person to be elected as a director as
provided herein, and to solicit proxies or consents in favor thereof, and take
all Necessary Action to otherwise give the fullest effect possible to the
provisions of this _ARTICLE II_.

 



 

ARTICLE III

Section 3.01. _Limitations on Transfer_.

 



 

(a) During the six (6) month period following the date of the Closing (the "
_Initial Holding Period_ "), none of the members of the Sponsor Shareholder
Group shall Transfer any of its Company Shares unless such Transfer is (i)
pursuant to or in connection with a Recommended Transaction or (ii) approved
by the Board.

 



 

(b) After the Initial Holding Period, for so long as the members of the
Sponsor Shareholder Group beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of the
Company Shares then issued and outstanding, no Sponsor Shareholder shall
Transfer any of its Company Shares unless:

applicable securities or "blue sky" Laws; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any of the following conditions is satisfied in connection with such
Transfer:

 



 

(A) to the knowledge of such Sponsor Shareholder, the Transferee of such
Company Shares (whether a Person or a "group", as defined under the Exchange
Act) would not, after completion of such Transfer, beneficially own more than
ten percent (10%) of the Company Shares then issued and outstanding or, if
such Transferee is, to the knowledge of such Sponsor Shareholder, a Passive
Institutional Investor, fifteen percent (15%) of the Company Shares then
issued and outstanding;

 



 

(B) such Transfer is pursuant to, or in connection with, a Recommended
Transaction;

 



 

(C) such Transfer is pursuant to an Underwritten Offering; or

 



 

(D) such Transfer is approved by the Board.

 



 

(c) For purposes of:

 



 

(i) the foregoing clauses _(a)(ii)_ and _(b)(ii)(D)_ , the Board shall act by
a majority of the members of the Board other than the Designated Sponsor
Directors; and

 



 

(ii) the foregoing clause _(b)(ii)(A)_ , "knowledge" means the actual
knowledge of the relevant Sponsor Shareholder, after review of the SECs EDGAR
system with respect to the Transferee if the identity of the Transferee is
known and (i) in no event shall (A) the knowledge of such Sponsor
Shareholders broker be imputed to such Sponsor Shareholder and (B) such
Sponsor Shareholder have any obligation to make inquiry or investigation as to
the identity of the Transferee and (ii) if such Sponsor Shareholder has actual
knowledge of the identity of the Transferee, such Sponsor Shareholder shall be
entitled to rely on information available on the SECs EDGAR system as to such
Transferees beneficial ownership of Company Shares.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.01_, from and
after the expiration of the Initial Holding Period, the first Transfer of
Company Shares made by any Sponsor Shareholder shall be pursuant to a
Qualified Public Offering unless (i) a Qualified Public Offering of Company
Shares has been completed prior thereto or (ii) the definitions of "Change of
Control", "Change of Control Event" and "TCIL Change of Control" under each of
the debt agreements of Triton or any of its subsidiaries existing on the date
hereof have been amended such that a Transfer by any of the Permitted Holders
(as defined in such agreements), in and of itself, would not trigger a "Change
of Control", "Change of Control Event" or "TCIL Change of Control" (as defined
in such agreements), or all such debt agreements have been terminated and have
not been replaced with new debt agreements that contain similar change of
control provisions that would be triggered by a transfer by any of the
Permitted Holders.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.01_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect a Qualified Public
Offering on or prior to the expiration of the Initial Holding Period (it being
understood that the size and manner of distribution of such Qualified Public
Offering shall be at the Companys discretion) unless the definitions of
"Change of Control", "Change of Control Event" and "TCIL Change of Control"
under each of the debt agreements of Triton or any of its subsidiaries
existing on the date hereof have been amended such that any Transfer of
Company Shares by ICIL Triton Holdings, L.P. or any of its Affiliates, in and
of itself, to Tulip Growth PCC Limited or any of its Affiliates would not
trigger a "Change of Control", "Change of Control Event" or "TCIL Change of
Control" (as defined in such agreements), or all such debt agreements have
been terminated and have not been replaced with new debt agreements that
contain similar change of control provisions that would be triggered by any
such transfer.

 



 

(f) Any purported Transfer of Company Shares by a Sponsor Shareholder other
than in accordance with this _Section 3.01_ shall be null and void, and the
Company shall refuse to recognize any such Transfer for any purpose and shall
not, and shall cause the Companys transfer agent not to, reflect in its
records any change in record ownership of Company Shares pursuant to any such
Transfer.

 



 

Section 3.02. _Transfers to Affiliates [and other Permitted Transferees]_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 3.01_, a Sponsor
Shareholder may Transfer any of its respective Company Shares to an Affiliate

be required, at the time of and as a condition to such Transfer, to become a
Party to this Agreement by executing and delivering a Joinder Agreement in the
form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (each, a " _Joinder Agreement_ ") and such other
documents as may be necessary to make such Person a Party hereto, whereupon
such Transferee will be treated as a Sponsor Shareholder for all purposes of
this Agreement.

completed prior thereto or (ii) the definitions of "Change of Control",
"Change of Control Event" and "TCIL Change of Control" under each of the debt
agreements of Triton or any of its subsidiaries existing on the date hereof
have been amended such that such Transfer of Company Shares, in and of itself,
would not trigger a "Change of Control", "Change of Control Event" or "TCIL
Change of Control" (as defined in such agreements), or all such debt
agreements have been terminated and have not been replaced with new debt
agreements that contain similar change of control provisions that would be
triggered by any such transfer.](4)

Company.

 



 

Section 4.03. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Sponsor Shareholders acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing Date and until the date that is eighteen (18) months

and that it and its Affiliates shall (x) use Confidential Information solely
in connection with its investment in the Company and not for any competitive
purpose or other purpose detrimental to the Company or its Subsidiaries and
(y) cause any of its Representatives to whom Confidential Information is
disclosed to not disclose any Confidential Information to any Person, except
that Confidential Information may be disclosed:

 



 

(i) to its Representatives in the normal course of the performance of such
Representatives duties; _provided_ , that such disclosing Sponsor Shareholder
shall be liable for any disclosure of such Representatives in violation of
this Agreement and such disclosing Sponsor Shareholder has directed its
Representatives to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this
Agreement;

 



 

(ii) to the extent required by applicable Law, rule or regulation, including
complying with any oral or written questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process to which the relevant Sponsor Shareholder is subject; _provided_ ,
that such

 



      
 

 



 

Sponsor Shareholder gives the Company prompt notice of such requests or
requirements, to the extent practicable, so that the Company may seek an
appropriate protective order or similar relief at the Companys sole expense
(and the Sponsor Shareholder shall cooperate with such efforts by the Company,
and shall in any event make only the minimum disclosure required by such Law,
rule or regulation);

 



 

(iii) to any regulatory authority to which the relevant Sponsor Shareholder or
any of its Affiliates is subject or which it has regular dealings with, as
long as such disclosure is made pursuant to routine examinations or requests
and such authority is advised of the confidential nature of such information;

 



 

(iv) to any other Sponsor Shareholder who is bound by the provisions of this
_Section 4.03(a_); or

 



 

(v) if the prior written consent of the Company shall have been obtained.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) a Sponsor Shareholder is contemplating a Transfer of
its Company Shares, and (ii) the Person to whom such Sponsor Shareholder is
contemplating to Transfer its Company Shares (the " _Prospective Transferee_
") seeks to receive access to Confidential Information for due diligence
purposes in connection with such contemplated Transfer, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the relevant Sponsor
Shareholder in making available such Confidential Information to the
Prospective Transferee; _provided_ , that the Prospective Transferee is
approved by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and the Prospective Transferee enters into a confidentiality
agreement with the Company on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause _(a)_ , from and
after the Closing and until the date that is eighteen (18) months following
the date when the Sponsor Shareholder Group is no longer entitled to designate
[any Warburg Pincus Director/the Vestar Director] (including as a result of a
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), each of the
Sponsor Shareholders shall establish appropriate procedures, in accordance
with its customary practice, to prevent the disclosure of Confidential
Information to any other Person employed by or affiliated with such Sponsor
Shareholder engaged in the due diligence, negotiation or evaluation of any
acquisition or investment of any Person that primarily operates in the
intermodal container leasing business (other than the Company).

 



 

(d) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the use (subject, to the extent
possible, to a protective order) of Confidential Information in connection
with the assertion or defense of any claim by or against the Company or any
Sponsor Shareholder.

 



 

Section 4.04. _Registration Rights_. The Sponsor Shareholders shall have the
registration and other rights on the terms set forth in _Exhibit G_, and the
Parties hereby agree to such terms.

(a) Such Party has the necessary legal capacity or power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder. To the
extent applicable, such Party is duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and the execution of this Agreement,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, have been
authorized by all necessary corporate or other action, and no other act or

accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law) and any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery by such Party of this Agreement and the
performance of its obligations hereunder do not and will not (i) conflict
with, or result in the breach of any provision of the constitutive documents
of such Party; (ii) result in any violation, breach, conflict, default or
event of default (or an event which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default or event of default), or give rise to any right of
acceleration or termination or any additional payment obligation, under the
terms of any material contract, agreement or permit to which such Party is a
party or by which such Partys assets or operations are bound or affected; or
(iii) violate, in any material respect, any Law applicable to such Party, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Other than any consents that have already been obtained, no consent,
waiver, approval, authorization, exemption, registration, license or
declaration is required to be made or obtained by such Party in connection
with (i) the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or (ii) the
consummation of any of the transactions currently contemplated herein,
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any transactions contemplated herein
solely as a result of one or more amendments to this Agreement following the
date hereof.

 



 

ARTICLE VI

Company Shares; _provided_ , in each case, that (A) the provisions of _Section
4.02_, _Section 4.03_, _ARTICLE VI_ and, as it relates to the foregoing
provisions, _ARTICLE I_, shall survive such termination and remain valid and

and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the

Section 6.06. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN

executed and delivered by the Party whose rights are waived; _provided_ that
any waiver by the Company of the obligations of a Sponsor Shareholder
hereunder shall require approval by a majority of the members of the Board
other than the Designated Sponsor Directors. No waiver of any breach shall be
deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of such breach or a waiver of any
other or subsequent breach. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no
failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder, or otherwise available in respect hereof at
Law or in equity, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.09. _Corporate Opportunity_. For so long as the Sponsor Shareholder
Group is entitled to designate [any Warburg Pincus Director/the Vestar

deemed to be an Affiliate of the Company, the Company shall not seek or
consent to any amendment to section 26.7 of the Bye-laws without the consent
of the Sponsor Shareholder Group.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Sponsor Shareholder Group_. Whenever the Sponsor Shareholder
Group is permitted or required to exercise any right (including any right to
consent or object to any action) or take any action under this Agreement, any
instrument in writing, executed by Sponsor Shareholders beneficially owning at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Company Shares beneficially owned by
the Sponsor Shareholder Group, shall constitute the valid exercise of such
right or taking of such action by the Sponsor Shareholder Group.

 



 

Section 6.11. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

provisions of this Agreement and those transactions.

provided in this Agreement, this Agreement does not create any rights, claims
or benefits inuring to any Person that is not a Party hereto, and it does not
create or establish any third party beneficiary hereto.

contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto; and no
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, shareholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any Party hereto (including any Person negotiating or
executing this Agreement on behalf of a Party hereto), unless party to this
Agreement, shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this
Agreement or with respect any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including a representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.16. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Company, the Sponsor Shareholders and their respective
heirs, legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors and
permitted assigns. The rights of the Sponsor Shareholders under this Agreement
shall not be assignable, except in connection with a Transfer of Company
Shares to an Affiliate thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.17. _Enforcement_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other Party hereto of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary
damages) to seek (on behalf of itself and the third-party beneficiaries of
this Agreement) (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an
injunction, restraining such breach or threatened breach. No Party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 6.17_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

Section 6.18. _Exculpation Among Sponsor Shareholders_. Each Sponsor
Shareholder acknowledges that it is not relying upon any other Person in
making its investment or decision to invest in the Company (other than the
Company pursuant to any written agreement). Each Sponsor Shareholder agrees
that no Sponsor Shareholder nor its respective Affiliates, controlling
persons, officers, directors, partners, agents or employees of any Sponsor
Shareholder shall be liable to any other Sponsor Shareholder for any action
heretofore or hereafter taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in
connection with their purchase or acquisition of any Company Shares, except
with respect to breaches hereof.

 



 

Section 6.19. _Subsequent Acquisition of Company Securities_. Any Company
Securities acquired subsequent to the date of the Closing by a member of the
Sponsor Shareholder Group shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.20. _Effectiveness_. This Agreement, and the Parties respective
rights and obligations hereunder, shall be of no force or effect until the
occurrence of the Closing. Upon the occurrence of the Closing, this Agreement,
and all of the Parties respective rights and obligations hereunder, shall
immediately and automatically become effective, without any further action on
the part of any Party or other Person. If the Transaction Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, this Agreement
shall terminate without any liability or obligation of any Party.

Section 2. _Demand Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Demand by Holders_.

 



 

(i) If, at any time after the six (6) month anniversary of the date of the
Closing, there is no currently effective Shelf Registration Statement on file
with the SEC and the Company shall have received a request, subject to
_Section 17_, from any Qualified Shareholder (the " _Requesting Shareholder_
") that the Company effect the registration

 



      
 

 



 

under the Securities Act of all or any portion of such Requesting
Shareholders Registrable Securities (x) on Form S-1 or any similar long-form
Registration Statement (a " _Long-Form Registration_") or (y) on Form S-3 or
any similar short-form Registration Statement (a " _Short-Form
Registration_") if the Company qualifies to use such short form Registration
Statement (any such requested Long-Form Registration or Short-Form
Registration, a " _Demand Registration_ "), and specifying the kind and
aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and the intended
method of disposition thereof, then the Company shall promptly, but in no
event later than eleven (11) Business Days prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement relating to such Demand Registration, give notice of
such request (a " _Demand Notice_ ") to the other Holders, specifying the
number of Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Shareholder has
requested registration under this _Section 2(a)_. During the ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of a Demand Notice, all Holders (other than the
Requesting Shareholder) may provide a written request to the Company,
specifying the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities held by such Holders
requested to be registered as part of such Demand Registration and the
intended method of distribution thereof.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall file such Registration Statement with the SEC within
ninety (90) days of such request, in the case of a Long-Form Registration, and
thirty (30) days of such request, in the case of a Short-Form Registration,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement
to be declared effective under the Securities Act and the "blue sky" Laws of
such jurisdictions as any Participating Shareholder or any underwriter, if
any, reasonably requests, as expeditiously as possible, all to the extent
necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods
thereof) of the Registrable Securities so to be registered.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2(a_), (A)
the Company shall not be obligated to effect more than two (2) Long-Form
Registrations over any three (3) year period at the request of any Holder, (B)
from and after the time the Company becomes eligible for a Short-Form
Registration, the Holders shall be entitled to effect two (2) Short-Form
Registrations per calendar year in the aggregate in addition to the Long-Form
Registrations to which they are entitled (which Long-Form Registrations, at
the election of the Requesting Shareholder, may be effected as Short-Form
Registrations, in which case they will count as Long-Form Registrations for
purposes of the preceding clause _(A)_ ) and (C) the Company shall not be
obligated to effect a Demand Registration unless the aggregate proceeds
expected to be received from the sale of the Registrable Securities requested
to be included in such Demand Registration equals or exceeds fifty million
dollars ($50,000,000) if pursuant to a Long-Form Registration, or twenty-five
million dollars ($25,000,000) if pursuant to a Short-Form Registration.

 



 

(b) _Demand Withdrawal_. A Participating Shareholder may withdraw its
Registrable Securities from a Demand Registration at any time prior to the
effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a
notice from all of the Participating Shareholders to such effect, the Company
shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement, and such registration shall nonetheless be deemed a Demand

 



      
 

 



 

Registration for purposes of _Section 2(a)_ unless (i) the withdrawing
Participating Shareholders shall have paid or reimbursed the Company for their
pro rata share of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the registration of the
withdrawing Participating Shareholders withdrawn Registrable Securities
(based on the number of Registrable Securities such withdrawing Participating
Shareholders sought to register, as compared to the total number of Company
Securities included on such Registration Statement), (ii) the withdrawal is
made following the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change, because the
registration would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or
because the Company otherwise requests withdrawal or (iii) the withdrawal
arose out of the fault of the Company (in each such case the Company shall be
obligated to pay all Registration Expenses in connection with such revoked
request except to the extent otherwise paid pursuant to clause (i)).

 



 

(c) _Company Notifications_. Within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt
by the Participating Shareholders of the Demand Notice, the Company will
notify all Participating Shareholders of the identities of the other
Participating Shareholders and the number of Registrable Securities requested
to be included therein.

 



 

(d) _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall be liable for and pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with any Demand Registration, regardless
of whether such registration is effected, subject to reimbursement pursuant to
_Section 2(b)(i)_, if applicable.

 



 

(e) _Effective Registration_. A Demand Registration shall be deemed to have
occurred if the Registration Statement relating thereto (i) has become
effective under the Securities Act and (ii) has remained effective for a
period of at least 180 calendar days (or such shorter period in which all
Registrable Securities of the Participating Shareholders included in such
registration have actually been sold thereunder or withdrawn) or, if such
Registration Statement relates to an Underwritten Offering, such longer period
as, in the opinion of counsel for the underwriter or underwriters, a
prospectus is required by Law to be delivered in connection with sales of
Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer (the applicable period, the
" _Demand Period_ "); _provided_ , that a Demand Registration shall not be
deemed to have occurred if, (A) during the Demand Period, such Registration
Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or
requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court, (B) the
conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered
into in connection with such registration are not satisfied other than by
reason of a wrongful act, misrepresentation or breach of such applicable
underwriting agreement by any Requesting Shareholder or (C) the Maximum
Offering Size (as defined below) is reduced in accordance with _Section 2(g)_
such that less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Registrable Securities
that the Requesting Shareholder sought to be included in such registration are
included.

 



 

(f) _Underwritten Offerings_. If any Participating Shareholder that is a
Qualified Shareholder so requests, an offering of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten
Offering.

 



 

(g) _Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand Registrations_. If
the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering
advise the Board (or, in the case of a Demand Registration not being
underwritten, the Board determines in its

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable discretion) that, in its view, the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration (including any securities that
the Company proposes to be included that are not Registrable Securities)
exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without being likely to
have an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such
shares can be sold, or the market for the securities offered, (the " _Maximum
Offering Size_ "), the Company shall include in such registration, in the
priority listed below, up to the Maximum Offering Size:

 



 

(i) first, all Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the
Participating Shareholders who requested registration under _Section 2(a)_
(allocated, if necessary for the offering not to exceed the Maximum Offering
Size, pro rata among such Participating Shareholders on the basis of the
relative number of Registrable Securities owned by the Participating
Shareholders; _provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to a
Participating Shareholder that exceed such Participating Shareholders request
shall be reallocated among the remaining Participating Shareholders in like
manner), and

 



 

(ii) second, and only if all the securities referred to in clause (i) have
been included, any securities proposed to be registered by the Company or any
securities proposed to be registered for the account of any other Persons
(including the Company), with such priorities among them as the Company shall
determine.

 



 

(h) _Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration_. If the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of a
Demand Registration at any time would require the Company to make an Adverse
Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action
to the Participating Shareholders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness
of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement (a " _Demand Suspension_
"); _provided_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Demand
Suspension (i) more than twice during any 12-month period or (ii) for a period
exceeding sixty (60) days on any one occasion; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in the event of a Demand Suspension, if a Participating Shareholder has
not sold any Company Securities under such Registration Statement, it shall be
entitled to withdraw Registrable Securities from such Demand Registration and,
if all Participating Shareholders so withdraw, such Demand Registration shall
not be counted for purposes of the limit on Long-Form Registrations requested
by such Participating Shareholders in _Section 2(a)_. In the case of a Demand
Suspension, the Participating Shareholders agree to suspend use of the
applicable prospectus and any issuer free writing prospectuses in connection
with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable
Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall
immediately notify the Participating Shareholders upon the termination of any
Demand Suspension, amend or supplement the prospectus and any issuer free
writing prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and furnish to the Participating
Shareholders such numbers of copies of the prospectus and any issuer free
writing prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Participating
Shareholders may reasonably request. The Company agrees, if necessary, to
supplement or make amendments to the applicable Registration Statement if
required by the registration form used by the Company for the applicable
Demand Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration
form or by the Securities Act or the rules or

 



      
 

 



 

regulations promulgated thereunder, or as may reasonably be requested by the
Participating Shareholder.

 



 

Section 3. _Shelf Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Filing_. At such time as the Company is eligible to file a registration
statement on Form S-3, within thirty (30) days of a request, subject to
_Section 17_, by a Qualified Shareholder (a " _Shelf Offering Request_ "),
the Company shall file with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement relating to
the offer and sale of all Registrable Securities by the Holders from time to
time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders
and set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and, as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act (or if the Company qualifies to do so, it shall file an
automatic Shelf Registration Statement in response to any such request). If,
on the date of any such Shelf Offering Request, the Company does not qualify
to file a Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act, the
provisions of this _Section 3_ shall not apply, and the provisions of
_Section 1_ shall apply instead. In no event shall the Company be required to
file a registration statement on Form S-1 to satisfy the requirements of this
_Section 3_.

 



 

(b) _Continued Effectiveness_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts (if the Company is not eligible to use an automatic Shelf Registration
Statement at the time of filing) to keep such Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act in order to permit the
prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by Holders until the earlier of
(i) the date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to
the Shelf Registration Statement or another Registration Statement filed under
the Securities Act (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to
in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) and (ii) the
date as of which each of the Holders is permitted to sell its Registrable
Securities without Registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act
without volume limitation or other restrictions on transfer thereunder (such
period of effectiveness, the " _Shelf Period_ "). Subject to _Section 3(e_),
the Company shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable best efforts to
keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Period if the
Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would
result in Holders of Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to
offer and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration
Statement during the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is required
by applicable Law or is in connection with a Shelf Suspension.

 



 

(c) _Shelf Notice_. Promptly upon receipt of any request to file a Shelf
Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 3(b)_ (but in no event more than
five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice
of any such request to all other Holders.

 



 

(d) _Suspension of Registration_. If the continued use of such Shelf
Registration Statement at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving at least 10 calendar days
prior written notice of such action to the Holders, suspend use of the Shelf
Registration Statement (a " _Shelf Suspension_ "); _provided_ , that the
Company shall not be permitted to exercise a Shelf Suspension (i) more than
twice during any 12-month period, or (ii) for a period exceeding sixty (60)
days on any one occasion. In the case

 



      
 

 



 

of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable
prospectus and any issuer free writing prospectus in connection with any sale
or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon
receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify
the Holders upon the termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement
the prospectus and any issuer free writing prospectus, if necessary, so it
does not contain any untrue statement or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of the prospectus
and any issuer free writing prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the
Holders may reasonably request. The Company agrees, if necessary, to
supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, if required
by the registration form used by the Company for the Shelf Registration or by
the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act
or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be
requested by the Holders.

 



 

(e) _Underwritten Offering_. For any offering of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement for which the value of
Registrable Securities proposed to be offered is at least fifty million
dollars ($50 million), if any Participating Shareholder that is a Qualified
Shareholder so elects, such offering shall be in the form of an Underwritten
Offering, and the Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration
Statement for such purpose. The provisions of _Section 2(g)_ shall apply to
any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 3(e_).

 



 

(f) _Payment of Expenses for Shelf Registrations_. The Company shall be
liable for and pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any Shelf
Registration, regardless of whether such registration is effected.

 



 

Section 4. _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Participation_. If the Company at any time proposes to file a
Registration Statement with respect to any offering of its securities for its
own account or for the account of any other Persons (other than (i) a
Registration Statement under _Section 2_ (it being understood that this
clause (i) does not limit the rights of Holders to make written requests
pursuant to _Section 2(a)_), (ii) a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8
or any successor form to such forms, (iii) a registration of securities solely
relating to an offering and sale to employees or directors of the Company
pursuant to any employee share plan or other employee benefit plan
arrangement, or (iv) a registration in connection with a direct or indirect
acquisition by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries of another Person or a
similar business combination transaction, however structured)) then, as soon
as practicable (but in no event less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the
proposed date of filing such Registration Statement), the Company shall give
written notice of such proposed filing to the Holders, and such notice shall
offer the Holders the opportunity to register under such Registration
Statement such number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may
request in writing (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to _Section
4(b)_ and _Section 4(c)_, the Company shall include in such Registration
Statement all such Registrable Securities that are requested to be included
therein within five (5) calendar days after the receipt by such Holders of any
such notice; _provided_ , that if at any time after giving written notice of
its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of
the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, the
Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration, the Company
shall give written notice of such determination to each Holder and, thereupon,
(A) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
registration (but not from its obligation to pay the Registration Expenses in
connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of the
Holders to request that such registration be effected as a Demand Registration
(subject to the provisions governing withdrawal set forth in _Section 2(b)_),
and (B) in the case of a determination to delay registering, in the absence of
a request for a Demand Registration, shall be permitted to delay registering
any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering
such other securities; _provided_ , that if such registration involves an
underwritten Public Offering, all such Holders requesting to be included in
the Companys registration must sell their Registrable Securities to the
underwriters selected as provided in _Section 7(j)_ on the same terms and
conditions as apply to the Company or the Holder requesting such registration,
as applicable, and the Company shall make arrangements with the managing
underwriter so that each such Holder may participate in such Underwritten
Offering.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Registrations Pursuant to a Piggyback Registration_. If a
Piggyback Registration involves an underwritten Public Offering (other than
any Demand Registration, in which case the provisions with respect to priority
of inclusion in such offering set forth in _Section 2(g)_ shall apply) and
the managing underwriter advises the Board (or, in the case of a Piggyback
Registration not being underwritten, the Board determines in its sole
discretion) that, in its view, the number of Company Shares that the Company
and such Holders intend to include in such registration exceeds the Maximum
Offering Size, the Company shall include in such registration, in the
following priority, up to the Maximum Offering Size:

 



 

(i) first, so much of the Company Securities proposed to be registered for
the account of the Company (or for the account of such other initiating
Person) as would not cause the offering to exceed the Maximum Offering Size,

 



 

(ii) second, and only if all of the securities referred to in clause (i) have
been included, all Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by any Holders pursuant to this _Section 4_ or Section 4 of
Exhibit G to the [Warburg Pincus Shareholders Agreement/Vestar Shareholders
Agreement] or by any holders of Registrable Securities under Section 4 of
Exhibit B to any of the Pritzker Lock-Up Agreements (allocated, if necessary
for the offering not to exceed the Maximum Offering Size, pro rata among such
Holders and such other holders of Registrable Securities on the basis of the
relative number of Registrable Securities owned by such Holders and such other
holders; _provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that
exceed such Holders request shall be reallocated among the remaining Holders
and other holders in like manner), and

 



 

(iii) third, and only if all of the securities referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii) have been included, any securities proposed to be registered for the
account of any other Persons with such priorities among them as the Company
shall determine.

 



 

(c) _Piggyback Withdrawal_. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or
part of its Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time
prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Subject to _Section 17_, no
registration effected under this _Section 4_ shall relieve the Company of its
obligations to effect a Demand Registration to the extent required by _Section
2_.

 



 

(d) _Payment of Expenses for Piggyback Registrations_. The Company shall pay
all Registration Expenses in connection with each Piggyback Registration,
regardless of whether such registration is effected.

 



 

Section 5. _Lock-Up Agreements_.

 



 

(a) In connection with each Public Offering, neither the Company nor any
Holder shall effect any public sale or distribution of any Company Securities
or other security of the Company (except as part of such Public Offering)
during the period beginning on the date that is estimated by the Company, in
good faith and provided in writing to such Holder, to be the seventh (7th)
calendar day prior to the effective date of the applicable Registration
Statement until the earlier of (i) such time as the Company and the lead
managing underwriter shall agree and (ii) ninety (90) calendar days after the
effective date of the applicable Registration Statement; _provided_ , that the
lead managing underwriter may extend such period as necessary to comply with
applicable FINRA rules.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect a public sale or
distribution of securities of the type described above and during the periods
described above if such sale or distribution is made pursuant to registrations
on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such forms or as part of any
registration of securities for offering and sale to employees or directors of
the Company pursuant to any employee share plan or other employee benefit plan
arrangement. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from each holder of restricted securities of the Company which securities are
the same as or similar to the Registrable Securities being registered, or any
restricted securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
of such securities, an agreement not to effect any public sale or distribution
of such securities during any such period referred to in this paragraph,
except as part of any such registration, if permitted.

 



 

Section 6. _Other Registration Rights_ (a). The Company represents and
warrants that it is not a party to, or otherwise subject to, any agreement
(other than as provided herein) granting registration rights to any other
Person with respect to any securities of the Company, other than pursuant to
the Vestar Shareholders Agreement, the Warburg Pincus Shareholders Agreement
and each of the Pritzker Lock-Up Agreements. The Company shall not grant to
any Person the right, other than as set forth herein, and except to employees
of the Company with respect to registrations on Form S-8, to request the
Company to register any Company Securities except such rights as are not more
favorable than or inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders and that
do not violate the rights or adversely affect the priorities of the Holders
set forth herein.

 



 

Section 7. _Registration Procedures_ (a). In connection with any registration
pursuant to _Section 2_, _Section 3_ or _Section 4_, subject to the
provisions of such Sections:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Prior to filing a Registration Statement covering Registrable Securities
or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Company shall, if
requested, furnish to each Participating Shareholder and each underwriter, if
any, of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter
the Company shall furnish to such Participating Shareholder and underwriter,
if any, without charge such number of copies of such Registration Statement,
each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits
thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus
included in such Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus
and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 or
Rule 430A under the Securities Act and such other documents as such
Participating Shareholder or underwriter may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Participating Shareholder. Each Participating Shareholder shall have the right
to request that the Company modify any information contained in such
Registration Statement, amendment and supplement thereto pertaining to such
Participating Shareholder and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
comply with such request; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have any
obligation to so modify any information if the Company reasonably expects that
so doing would cause the prospectus to contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

 



 

(b) In connection with any filing of any Registration Statement or prospectus
or amendment or supplement thereto, the Company shall cause such document (i)
to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and (ii) with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion in the
Registration Statement, to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly notify each Holder of such Registrable
Securities and the underwriter(s) and, if requested by such Holder or the
underwriter(s), confirm in writing, when a Registration Statement has become
effective and when any post-effective amendments and supplements thereto
become effective.

 



 

(d) The Company shall furnish counsel for each underwriter, if any, and for
the Holders of such Registrable Securities with copies of any written comments
from the SEC or any state securities authority or any written request by the
SEC or any state securities authority for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional information generally.

 



 

(e) After the filing of the Registration Statement, the Company shall (i)
cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus
supplement, and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under
the Securities Act, (ii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the Participating Shareholders set forth in
such Registration Statement or supplement to such prospectus and (iii)
promptly notify each Participating Shareholder holding Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement of any stop

 



      
 

 



 

order issued or threatened by the SEC or any state securities commission and
use commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of such stop
order or to remove it if entered.

 



 

(f) The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to (i) register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
under such securities or "blue sky" Laws of such jurisdictions in the United
States as any Participating Shareholder holding such Registrable Securities
reasonably (in light of such Participating Shareholders intended plan of
distribution) requests and (ii) cause such Registrable Securities to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities
as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Company
and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable such Participating Shareholder to consummate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Participating
Shareholder; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to (A)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this _Section 7(f)_, (B) subject
itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general service
of process in any such jurisdiction.

 



 

(g) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide a transfer
agent, registrar and CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities not
later than the effective date of such Registration Statement.

 



 

(h) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
Holder and the underwriter or managing underwriter, if any, to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable
Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such
Registrable Securities to be in such denominations (consistent with the
provisions of the governing documents thereof) and registered in such names as
each Holder or the underwriter or managing underwriter, if any, may reasonably
request at least three (3) Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable
Securities.

 



 

(i) The Company shall immediately notify each Participating Shareholder
holding such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement, at
any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of
a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered
to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading and promptly prepare and make available to each such
Participating Shareholder and file with the SEC any such supplement or
amendment subject to any suspension rights contained herein.

 



 

(j) The Company shall have the right to select an underwriter or underwriters
in connection with any underwritten Public Offering resulting from the
exercise of a Demand Registration or in connection with any other underwritten
Public Offering; _provided_ , that in connection with any Demand Registration,
the Company will consult with the Holders before selecting the lead
underwriter; _provided_ , _further_ , that in connection with any Demand
Registration, the Holder requesting such Demand Registration shall have the
right to select two (2) co-managers reasonably acceptable to the Company. In
connection with any Public Offering, the Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including an underwriting agreement in

 



      
 

 



 

customary form) and take all other actions as are reasonably required and
customary in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in any such Public Offering, including the engagement
of a "qualified independent underwriter" in connection with the qualification
of the underwriting arrangements with FINRA.

 



 

(k) Upon execution of confidentiality agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall make available
during regular business hours for inspection by any Participating Shareholder
and any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to a
Registration Statement being filed by the Company pursuant to this _Section
7_ and any attorney, accountant or other professional retained by any such
Participating Shareholder or underwriter (collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "),
all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties
of the Company (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall be reasonably
necessary or desirable to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys officers, directors and employees to
supply all information reasonably requested by any Inspectors in connection
with such Registration Statement. Records that the Company determines, in good
faith, to be confidential and that it notifies the Inspectors are confidential
shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such
Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such
Registration Statement or (ii) the release of such Records is required
pursuant to applicable Law or regulation or judicial process. Each
Participating Shareholder agrees that information obtained by it as a result
of such inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it
or its Affiliates as the basis for any market transactions in the Company
Securities unless and until such information is made generally available to
the public. Each Participating Shareholder further agrees that, upon learning
that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, it shall give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at
its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the
Records deemed confidential.

 



 

(l) The Company shall furnish to each Participating Shareholder and to each
such underwriter, if any, a signed counterpart, addressed to such
Participating Shareholder or underwriter, of (i) an opinion or opinions of
counsel to the Company and (ii) a comfort letter or comfort letters from the
Companys independent certified public accountants, each in customary form and
covering such matters of the kind customarily covered by opinions or comfort
letters, as the case may be, as the managing underwriter therefor reasonably
requests.

 



 

(m) The Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions to ensure that
any free-writing prospectus utilized in connection with any Demand
Registration or Piggyback Registration hereunder complies in all material
respects with the Securities Act, is filed in accordance with the Securities
Act to the extent required thereby, is retained in accordance with the
Securities Act to the extent required thereby and, when taken together with
the related prospectus, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(n) The Company shall otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
available to its security

 



      
 

 



 

holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement or such
other document that shall satisfy the provisions of _Section 11(a)_ of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

 



 

(o) The Company may require each such Participating Shareholder promptly to
furnish in writing to the Company such information regarding the distribution
of the Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably
request and such other information as may be legally required or the Company
may deem reasonably advisable in connection with such registration and shall
not have any obligation to include a Participating Shareholder on any
Registration Statement if such information is not promptly provided;
_provided_ , that, prior to excluding such Participating Shareholder on the
basis of its failure to provide such information, the Company must furnish in
writing a reminder to such Participating Shareholder requesting such
information at least three (3) days prior to filing the applicable
Registration Statement.

 



 

(p) Each such Participating Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any
notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
_Section 7(i)_, such Participating Shareholder shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
covering such Registrable Securities until such Participating Shareholders
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by _Section 7(i)_, and, if so directed by the Company, such Participating
Shareholder shall deliver to the Company all copies, other than any permanent
file copies then in such Participating Shareholders possession, of the most
recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt
of such notice. If the Company shall give such notice, the Company shall
extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained
effective (including the period referred to in _Section 7(a)_) by the number
of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice
pursuant to _Section 7(i)_ to the date when the Company shall make available
to such Participating Shareholder a prospectus supplemented or amended to
conform with the requirements of _Section 7(i)_.

 



 

(q) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to list all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement on any
securities exchange or quotation system on which any of the Registrable
Securities are then listed or traded.

 



 

(r) In connection with an Underwritten Offering, the Company shall have
appropriate officers of the Company (i) prepare and make presentations at any
"road shows" and before analysts and rating agencies, as the case may be, (ii)
otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate as reasonably
requested by the underwriters in the offering, marketing or selling of the
Registrable Securities, including, by executing customary underwriting
agreements and (iii) otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Holders in the marketing of the
Registrable Securities.

 



 

Section 8. _Indemnification by the Company_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Participating
Shareholder holding Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement, each member, trustee, limited or general partner thereof, each
member, trustee, limited or general partner of each such member, limited or
general partner, each of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
stockholders, shareholders, employees, advisors and agents, each Person, if
any, who

 



      
 

 



 

controls such Person within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of their Representatives from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) (" _Damages_ ") caused by or relating to (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) any
Registration Statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities
(as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments
or supplements thereto), any preliminary prospectus or any "issuer free
writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act) or (B) any
application or other document or communication executed by or on behalf of the
Company or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify any securities covered
by such registration under the securities Laws thereof, (ii) any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii)
any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any
other similar federal or state securities Laws or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such registration,
qualification or compliance, except in all cases insofar as such Damages are
caused by or related to any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission so made based upon or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Participating
Shareholder expressly for use therein or by such Participating Shareholders
failure to deliver a copy of the prospectus, the issuer free writing
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the Company has
furnished such Participating Shareholder with a sufficient number of copies of
the same.

 



 

(b) The Company also agrees to indemnify any underwriters of the Registrable
Securities, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
underwriters within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification of the Participating Shareholders provided in this _Section
8_ or otherwise on commercially reasonable terms negotiated on an arms length
basis with such underwriters.

 



 

Section 9. _Indemnification by Participating Shareholders_ (a). Each
Participating Shareholder holding Registrable Securities included in any
Registration Statement agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors and agents and each Person,
if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
indemnity from the Company contained in _Section 8(a)(i)_ and _Section
8(a)(ii)_ to such Participating Shareholder, but only with respect to
information furnished in writing by such Participating Shareholder or on such
Participating Shareholders behalf expressly for use in any Registration
Statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, any preliminary prospectus or any "issuer
free writing prospectus." Each such Participating Shareholder also agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless any underwriters of the Registrable Securities,
their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification of the Company provided in this _Section 9_. As a condition
to including Registrable Securities in any Registration Statement filed in
accordance herewith, the Company may require that it shall have received an

 



      
 

 



 

undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any underwriter to indemnify
and hold it harmless to the extent customarily provided by underwriters with
respect to similar securities. No Participating Shareholder shall be liable
under this _Section 9_ for any Damages in excess of the gross proceeds
realized by such Participating Shareholder in the sale of Registrable
Securities of such Participating Shareholder to which such Damages relate.

 



 

Section 10. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_ (a). If any proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 8_ or
_Section 9_, such Person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify
the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") in writing and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense
thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all fees and expenses;
_provided_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent and only to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. In any such
proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of such counsel,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such
claim or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party representation
of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case
of any such separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be
designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there be a final
judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold
harmless such Indemnified Parties from and against any loss or liability (to
the extent stated above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. Without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Indemnifying Party shall effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such proceeding.

 



 

Section 11. _Survival_ (a). _Section 8_, _Section 9_, _Section 10_ and
_Section 12_ hereto will remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer,
director or controlling Person of such Indemnified Party and will survive the
transfer of securities.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12. _Contribution_.

 



 

(a) If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable to the
Indemnified Parties in respect of any Damages, then each such Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Damages
(i) as between the Company and the Participating Shareholders holding
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement on the one hand and
the underwriters on the other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative benefits received by the Company and such Participating
Shareholders on the one hand and the underwriters on the other, from the
offering of the Registrable Securities, or if such allocation is not permitted
by applicable Law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and such
Participating Shareholders on the one hand and of such underwriters on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
Damages, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, and (ii) as
between the Company on the one hand and each Participating Shareholder on the
other, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Company and of each Participating Shareholder in connection with such
statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and
Participating Shareholders on the one hand and such underwriters on the other
shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the
offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting
expenses) received by the Company and Participating Shareholders bear to the
total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such underwriters, in
each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the prospectus. The
relative fault of the Company and Participating Shareholders on the one hand
and of such underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Company and Participating Shareholders
or by such underwriters. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and
of each Participating Shareholder on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission.

 



 

(b) The Company and the Participating Shareholders agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 12_ were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as
one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified
Party as a result of the Damages referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 12_, no Participating
Shareholder shall be required to contribute any amount for Damages in excess
of the gross proceeds realized by Participating Shareholder in the sale of
Registrable Securities of Participating Shareholder to which such Damages
relate. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person

 



      
 

 



 

who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Each Participating
Shareholders obligation to contribute pursuant to this _Section 12_ is
several in the proportion that the net proceeds of the offering received by
Participating Shareholder bears to the total net proceeds of the offering
received by all such Participating Shareholders and not joint.

 



 

Section 13. _Participation in Public Offering_ **.**

 



 

(a) No Person may participate in any Public Offering hereunder unless such
Person (i) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided in
any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to
approve such arrangements ( _provided_ , that no Holder of Registrable
Securities will be required to sell more than the number of Registrable
Securities that such Holder has requested the Company include in any
Registration Statement) and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and the
provisions set forth herein in respect of registration rights.

 



 

(b) Each Person that is participating in any registration hereunder agrees
that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any
event of the kind described in _Section 7(i)_ above, such Person shall
immediately discontinue the disposition of its Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement until such Persons receipt of the copies of a
supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by _Section 7(i)_. In the
event the Company has given any such notice, the applicable time period during
which a Registration Statement is to remain effective shall be extended (
_provided_ , that the Company shall not cause any Registration Statement to
remain effective beyond the latest date allowed by applicable Law) by the
number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of
such notice pursuant to this paragraph to and including the date when each
Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall
have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by _Section 7(i)_.

 



 

Section 14. _Compliance with Rule 144 and Rule 144A_(a). At the request of
any Holder who proposes to sell securities in compliance with Rule 144 of the
Securities Act, the Company shall (i) cooperate, to the extent commercially
reasonable, with such Holder, (ii) forthwith furnish to such Holder a written
statement of compliance with the filing requirements of the SEC as set forth
in Rule 144, as such rule may be amended from time to time, (iii) make
available to the public and such Holders such information, and take such
action as is reasonably necessary, to enable the Holders of Registrable
Securities to make sales pursuant to Rule 144, and (iv) use its reasonable
best efforts to list such Holders Company Shares on the NYSE. Unless the
Company is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company
will provide to the holder of Registrable Securities and to any prospective
purchaser of Registrable Securities under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, the
information described in Rule 144A(d)(4) of the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 15. _Foreign Registration_ (a). The Parties agree that, with respect
to the rights to register Registrable Securities set forth herein, all Holders
of Registrable Securities shall have comparable rights to register such
Registrable Securities on any non-U.S. securities exchange on which the
Company is listed or traded, if any; _provided_ , that the exercise of any

 



      
 

 



 

such rights to register Registrable Securities shall be governed by the same
limitations set forth herein (including, for the avoidance of doubt, that any
requests that are comparable to Long-Form Registrations, Short-Form
Registrations or requests to file a Shelf Registration Statement shall be
aggregated with any other such requests pursuant hereto for purposes of the
limitations set forth herein).

 



 

Section 16. _Selling Expenses_. All Selling Expenses relating to the offer and
sale of Registrable Securities registered under the Securities Act pursuant to
this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the Holders of such Registrable
Securities, in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities included in
such registration for each such Holder.

 



 

Section 17. _Prohibition on Requests_. No Holder shall, without the Companys
consent, be entitled to deliver a request for a Demand Registration or a Shelf
Offering Request if less than 90 calendar days have elapsed since (A) the
effective date of a prior Registration Statement in connection with a Demand
Registration, Shelf Registration or Piggyback Registration, (B) the date of
withdrawal by the Participating Shareholders of a Demand Registration or (C)
the pricing date of any Underwritten Offering effected by the Company;
_provided_ , in each case, that such Holder has been provided with an
opportunity to participate in the prior offering and has not been cut back to
less than 50% of the Registrable Securities requested to be included.

Re: _Project Ocean  Lock-Up_

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

Triton International Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited
liability under the laws of Bermuda (the " _Company_ "), Triton Container
International Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability
under the laws of Bermuda (" _Triton_ "), TAL International Group, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _TAL_ "), Ocean Delaware Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Delaware Sub_ "), and Ocean Bermuda Sub Limited an exempted
company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of Bermuda ("
_Bermuda Sub_ "), have entered into a Transaction Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof. Certain capitalized terms used in this letter agreement (this "
_Agreement_ ") are used as defined in _Exhibit A_ hereto and capitalized
terms used but not defined herein are used as defined in the Transaction
Agreement.

 



 

Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, on the Closing Date, (i) Bermuda Sub
will merge with and into Triton, with Triton surviving such merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) Delaware Sub will merge with
and into TAL, with TAL surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company (collectively, the " _Closing_ ").

 



 

In connection with the execution of the Transaction Agreement by the Company,
the Company and the undersigned (the " _Shareholder_ ") agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Lock-Up_. During the six (6) month period following the Closing Date (the " _Initial Holding Period_ "), the Shareholder shall not Transfer any of its Company Shares unless such Transfer is (i) pursuant to or in connection with a Recommended Transaction or (ii) approved by the Board.

 



 

2. _Transfers to Pritzker Transferees_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 1_, the Shareholder may Transfer any of its Company Shares to a Pritzker Transferee at any time, _provided_ that any such Pritzker Transferee shall be required, at the time of and as a condition to such Transfer, to execute a counterpart to this Agreement and such other documents as may be necessary to make such Person a party hereto, whereupon such Transferee will be treated as a Shareholder for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

3. _First Transfer_. From and after the expiration of the Initial Holding Period, the first Transfer of Company Shares made by the Shareholder shall be pursuant to a Qualified Public Offering unless (i) a Qualified Public Offering of Company Shares has been completed prior thereto or (ii) the definitions of "Change of Control", "Change of Control Event" and "TCIL Change of Control" under each of the debt agreements of Triton or any of its subsidiaries existing on the date hereof (the " _Debt Agreements_ ") have been amended such that a Transfer by any of the Permitted Holders (as defined in such Debt Agreements), in and of itself, would not trigger a "Change of Control", "Change of Control Event" or "TCIL Change of Control" (as defined in such Debt Agreements), or all such Debt Agreements have been terminated and have not

 



      
 

 



 

been replaced with new debt agreements that contain similar change of control
provisions that would be triggered by a transfer by any of the Permitted
Holders.

 



 

4. _Registration Rights_. The Shareholder shall have the registration and other rights on the terms set forth on _Exhibit B_, and the parties hereby agree to such terms.

 



 

5. _Legends_.

 



 

a. Each book entry position or certificate representing Company Shares issued
to the Shareholder pursuant to the Transaction Agreement shall bear a notation
or legend on the reverse side thereof substantially in the following form in
addition to any other legend determined by the Company or as required by
applicable Law or by agreement with the Company:

 



 

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE " _SECURITIES ACT_ "), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD, UNLESS IT
HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE (AND, IN SUCH CASE, AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUESTED BY THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT
SUCH OFFER OR SALE IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT).

 



 

THIS SECURITY MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OTHER
TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN A LETTER AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 9,
2015 (AS MAY BE AMENDED OR RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME), A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE
OBTAINED FROM THE COMPANY AT ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES.

 



 

b. Upon the permitted sale in accordance with this Agreement of any such
Company Shares (i) in a public offering and sale of equity securities of the
Company for cash pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (ii) in compliance with Rule 144 or Rule 144A under the
Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to another exemption from registration under
the Securities Act, or upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, upon the written request of the holder of such Company Shares,
any certificates representing such Company Shares shall be replaced, at the
expense of the Company, with certificates or instruments not bearing the
legends required by _Section 5.a_; _provided_ , that the Company may
condition any replacement of certificates pursuant to clause (ii) of this
_Section 5.b._ on the receipt of an opinion of legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (which opinion shall be at the expense of the
holder of such Company Shares) stating that such Company Shares are freely
transferable under the Securities Act.

 



 

c. In the event that any Company Shares shall cease (as reasonably determined
by the Company) to be subject to any or all of the restrictions described in
the restrictive

 



      
 

 



 

legends required by _Section 5.a._, the Company shall, upon the written
request of the holder thereof and without expense to such party (other than
applicable transfer taxes and similar government charges, if any), issue to
such holder a new certificate representing such Company Shares without the
inapplicable restrictive legend or legends, as applicable.

 



 

6. _Sponsor Shareholders Agreements_

 



 

a. The Company hereby represents to the Shareholder that all Company Shares to
be received by the Sponsor Parties as Merger Consideration will be subject to
shareholders agreements substantially in the form attached to the Transaction
Agreement as Exhibit C-1 (each, a " _Sponsor Shareholders Agreement_ ");

 



 

b. The Company covenants and agrees that if (i) it (or the Board) consents to
an amendment or modification of, or grants any waiver or consent under, any
Sponsor Shareholders Agreement that has the effect of permitting a Transfer of
Company Shares held by a Sponsor Party that would have otherwise been
restricted or limited by such Sponsor Shareholders Agreement and (ii) a
similar restriction or limitation is also contained in this Agreement, the
Company (or the Board) will concurrently with such consent or amendment
consent to an amendment or modification of, or grant a waiver or consent
under, this Agreement, so as to permit a Transfer by the Shareholder of a
proportionate number of Company Shares (measured as a percentage calculated by
dividing the total number of Company Shares held by such Sponsor Party that
are subject to a Sponsor Shareholders Agreement by the number of Company
Shares subject to such waiver or consent (the "Percentage"); in such case a
waiver or consent shall also apply to the Percentage of the shares held by the
Shareholder that are subject to this Agreement). The Company further agrees
that neither it nor its subsidiaries will seek or obtain any amendments or
modifications of, or waivers or consents pursuant to, the Debt Agreements that
have the effect of benefitting any Sponsor Party unless the Shareholder
benefits to the same degree as such Sponsor Party. In the event of any
amendment, waiver, consent or other action contemplated by this _Section
6.b._ the Company shall promptly provide written notice thereof to the
Shareholder.

 



 

7. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate at such time as the Shareholder no longer holds any Company Shares; _provided_ , that such termination shall not relieve any party from any liability with respect to breaches of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

8. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, or by facsimile, upon confirmation of receipt and (b) on the first (1st) Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered the next Business Day by a recognized next-day courier service. All notices hereunder shall be delivered as set forth below, or pursuant to such other instructions as may be designated in writing by the party to receive such notice.

The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or

suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. In
addition, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court.

 



 

12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY INVOLVING ANY MATTERS (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

13. _Interpretation_. The meanings of defined terms are equally applicable to the singular and plural forms of the defined terms. A reference to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit is a reference to an Article or Section of, or Exhibit to, this Agreement, and references to this Agreement include any recital in or Exhibit to this Agreement. The Exhibits and Schedules form an integral part hereof. Headings, captions and the Table of Contents are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, the words " _hereof_ " and " _herein_ ", and words of similar meaning refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or clause. The term " _including_ " is not limiting and means " _including without limitation_." Unless the context otherwise requires, the word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive. Whenever the context requires, any pronouns used herein shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intention or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

14. _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party hereto of any covenant or

 



      
 

 



 

obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it,
including monetary damages) to seek (on behalf of itself and the third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement) (a) a decree or order of specific performance
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and
(b) an injunction, restraining such breach or threatened breach. No party or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 14_, and each party hereto irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

15. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

16. _Waivers_. No waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless such waiver is made expressly in writing and executed and delivered by the party whose rights are waived. No waiver of any breach shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of such breach or a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder, or otherwise available in respect hereof at Law or in equity, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

17. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement does not create any rights, claims or benefits inuring to any Person that is not a party hereto, and it does not create or establish any third party beneficiary hereto.

 



 

18. _No Third Party Liability_. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named parties hereto. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may be made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto; and no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, trustee, shareholder representative, affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto (including any Person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party hereto), unless party to this Agreement, shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or tort) that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

 



 

19. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 



 

20. _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

shall have the same effect as original signatures.

 



 

21. _Effectiveness_. This Agreement, and the parties respective rights and obligations hereunder, shall be of no force or effect until the occurrence of the Closing. Upon the occurrence of the Closing, this Agreement, and all of the parties respective rights and obligations hereunder, shall immediately and automatically become effective, without any further action on the part of any party or other Person. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall terminate without any liability or obligation of any party.

 



 

22. _Transfers in Violation of this Agreement_. Any purported Transfer of Company Shares inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement shall be null and void, and the Company shall refuse to recognize any such Transfer for any purpose and shall not, and shall cause the Companys transfer agent not to, reflect in its records any change in record ownership of Company Shares pursuant to any such Transfer.

 



 

23. _Trustee Exculpation_.

which amended certain provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 5, 2005. This Third
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which amends and restates
the provisions of the Corporations Second Amended and Restated Certificate of

 **ARTICLE EIGHT**

 



 

The directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the stockholders

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE NINE**

 



 

The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval
or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of
the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or
contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the
vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
(provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person
or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon
all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every
stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would
otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interest or for any
other reason.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE TEN**

 



 

In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly
conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such
powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the

State of Delaware, of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (this " _Certificate_ ") and of any Bylaws from time to time

Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, indemnify all
persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto.

employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
against any liability, expense or loss asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the
obligation to indemnify such person against such liability, expense or loss
under the provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation or the Delaware General
Corporation Law. To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or
policies providing such insurance, each such person shall be covered by such
policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent
of the coverage thereunder for any such person.

 



 

 **ARTICLE THIRTEEN**

 



 

To the fullest extent permitted by Section 122(17) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, the Corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries,
renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation and its subsidiaries
in, or in being offered an opportunity to

 



      
 

 



 

participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to
any of (i) Vestar Capital Partners, Inc. and its affiliated funds, or (ii)
Warburg Pincus LLC and its affiliated funds, or any of their respective
officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and
subsidiaries (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries), even if the

be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted
the opportunity to do so and no such person shall be liable to the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a
director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person
pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business
opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity,
or information regarding such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its
subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or
officer of the Corporation, such business opportunity is expressly offered to
such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation. Any person purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in any shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this _Article
Thirteen_. Neither the alteration, amendment or repeal of this _Article
Thirteen_ nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate inconsistent
with this _Article Thirteen_ shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this
_Article Thirteen_ in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of
action, suit or claim that, but for this _Article Thirteen_, would accrue or
arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption.

 



 

 **ARTICLE FOURTEEN**

 



 

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law shall not apply to the
Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE FIFTEEN**

 



 

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and
its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within
the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the
Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of
any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under § 291 of Title 8
of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of
any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under § 279 of Title 8
of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the
case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a
majority in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on the Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE SIXTEEN**

 



 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders,

The Common Shares shall, subject to the other provisions of these Bye-Laws,
entitle the holders thereof to the following rights:

 



 

3.2.1 as regards dividend:

 



 

after making all necessary provisions, where relevant, for payment of any
preferred dividend in respect of any preference shares in the Company then in
issue, the Company shall apply any profits or reserves which the Board

rata to the number of Common Shares held by each of them;

generally and to Bye-Law 3.4 in particular, shall be as follows:

 



 

3.3.1 each Undesignated Share shall have attached to it such preferred,
qualified or other special rights, privileges and conditions and be subject to
such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, return of capital,
redemption, conversion into Common Shares or voting or otherwise, as the Board
may determine on or before its allotment;

 



 

3.3.2 the Board may allot the Undesignated Shares in more than one series and,
if it does so, may name and designate each series in such manner as it deems
appropriate to reflect the particular rights and restrictions attached to that
series, which may differ in all or any respects from any other series of
Undesignated Shares;

 



 

3.3.3 the particular rights and restrictions attached to any Undesignated
Shares shall be recorded in a resolution of the Board. The Board may at any
time before the allotment of any Undesignated Share by further resolution in
any way amend such rights and restrictions or vary or revoke its designation.
A copy of any such resolution or amending resolution for the time being in
force shall be annexed as an appendix to (but shall not form part of) these
Bye-Laws; and

 



 

3.3.4 the Board shall not attach to any Undesignated Share any rights or
restrictions which would alter or abrogate any of the special rights attached
to any other class of series of shares for the time being in issue without
such sanction as is required for any alteration or abrogation of such rights,
unless expressly authorised to do so by the rights attaching to or by the
terms of issue of such shares.

 



 

3.4 Without limiting the foregoing and subject to the Companies Acts, the
Company may issue preference shares (including any preference shares created
pursuant to Bye-Law 3.3) which:

 



      
 

 



 

3.4.1 are liable to be redeemed on the happening of a specified event or
events or on a given date or dates and/or;

 



 

3.4.2 are liable to be redeemed at the option of the Company and/or, if
authorised by the Memorandum of Association of the Company, at the option of
the holder.

 



 

3.5 The terms and manner of the redemption of any redeemable shares created
pursuant to Bye-Law 3.3 shall be as the Board may by resolution determine
before the allotment of such shares and the terms and manner of redemption of
any other redeemable preference shares shall be either:

 



 

3.5.1 as the Shareholders may by Resolution determine; or

 



 

3.5.2 insofar as the Shareholders do not by any Resolution determine, as the
Board may by resolution determine, in either case, before the allotment of
such shares. A copy of any such Resolution or resolution of the Board for the
time being in force shall be attached as an appendix to (but shall not form
part of) these Bye-Laws.

 



 

3.6 The terms of any redeemable preference shares (including any redeemable
preference shares created pursuant to Bye-Law 3.3) may provide for the whole
or any part of the amount due on redemption to be paid or satisfied otherwise
than in cash, to the extent permitted by the Companies Acts.

 



 

3.7 Subject to the foregoing and to any special rights conferred on the
holders of any share or class of shares, any share in the Company may be
issued with or have attached thereto such preferred, deferred, qualified or
other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend,
voting, return of capital or otherwise, as the Company may by Resolution
determine or, if there has not been any such determination or so far as the
same shall not make specific provision, as the Board may determine.

 



 

3.8 The Board may, at its discretion and without the sanction of a Resolution,
authorise the purchase by the Company of its own shares, of any class, at any
price (whether at par or above or below par), and any shares to be so
purchased may be selected in any manner whatsoever, upon such terms as the
Board may in its discretion determine, provided always that such purchase is
effected in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts. The whole or
any part of the amount payable on any such purchase may be paid or satisfied
otherwise than in cash, to the extent permitted by the Companies Acts.

 



 

3.9 The Board may, at its discretion and without the sanction of a Resolution,
authorise the acquisition by the Company of its own shares, of any class, at
any price (whether at par or above or below par), and any shares to be so
purchased may be selected in any manner whatsoever, to be held as treasury
shares, upon such terms as the Board may in its discretion determine, provided
always that such acquisition is effected in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Acts. The whole or any part of the amount payable on any such
acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

may be paid or satisfied otherwise than in cash, to the extent permitted by
the Companies Acts. The Company shall be entered in the Register as a
Shareholder in respect of the shares held by the Company as treasury shares
and shall be a Shareholder of the Company but subject always to the provisions
of the Companies Acts and for the avoidance of doubt the Company shall not
exercise any rights and shall not enjoy or participate in any of the rights
attaching to those shares save as expressly provided for in the Companies Act.

 



 

4. **MODIFICATION OF RIGHTS**

 



 

4.1 Subject to the Companies Acts, all or any of the special rights for the
time being attached to any class of shares for the time being issued may from
time to time (whether or not the Company is being wound up) be altered or
abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than seventy
five percent (75%) of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of
a resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of such
shares voting in person or by proxy. To any such separate general meeting, all
the provisions of these Bye-Laws as to general meetings of the Company shall
mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be two (2) or
more persons holding or representing by proxy the majority of the shares of
the relevant class, that every holder of shares of the relevant class shall be
entitled on a poll to one vote for every such share held by him and that any
holder of shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may
demand a poll; provided, however, that if the Company or a class of
Shareholders shall have only one Shareholder, one Shareholder present in
person or by proxy shall constitute the necessary quorum.

 



 

4.2 For the purposes of this Bye-Law, unless otherwise expressly provided by
the rights attached to any shares or class of shares, those rights attaching
to any class of shares for the time being shall not be deemed to be altered
by:

 



 

4.2.1 the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them;

 



 

4.2.2 the creation or issue for full value (as determined by the Board) of
further shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of
the Company or otherwise in priority to them; or

 



 

4.2.3 the purchase or redemption by the Company of any of its own shares.

 



 

5. **SHARES**

 



 

5.1 Subject to the provisions of these Bye-Laws, the unissued shares of the
Company (whether forming part of the original capital or any increased
capital) shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may offer, allot, grant
options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at such times and
for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions as the Board may
determine.

 



 

5.2 Subject to the provisions of these Bye-Laws, any shares of the Company
held by the Company as treasury shares shall be at the disposal of the Board,
which may hold all or any of the

 



       
 

 



 

shares, dispose of or transfer all or any of the shares for cash or other
consideration, or cancel all or any of the shares.

 



 

5.3 The Board may in connection with the issue of any shares exercise all
powers of paying commission and brokerage conferred or permitted by law.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, any such commission or
brokerage may be satisfied by the payment of cash or by the allotment of fully
or partly paid shares or partly in one way and partly in the other.

 



 

5.4 Shares may be issued in fractional denominations and in such event the
Company shall deal with such fractions to the same extent as its whole shares,
so that a share in a fractional denomination shall have, in proportion to the
fraction of a whole share that it represents, all the rights of a whole share,
including (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing) the right to
vote, to receive dividends and distributions and to participate in a winding-
up.

 



 

5.5 Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by
law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon
trust and the Company shall not be bound by or required in any way to
recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future
or partial interest in any share or in any fractional part of a share or
(except only as otherwise provided in these Bye-Laws or by law) any other
right in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof
in the registered holder.

 



 

6. **CERTIFICATES**

 



 

6.1 No share certificates shall be issued by the Company unless, in respect of
a class of shares, the Board has either for all or for some holders of such
shares (who may be determined in such manner as the Board thinks fit)
determined that the holder of such shares may be entitled to share
certificates. In the case of a share held jointly by several persons, delivery
of a certificate to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery
to all.

 



 

6.2 If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced
without fee but on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and to
payment of the costs and out of pocket expenses of the Company or the
Companys transfer agent in investigating such evidence and preparing such
indemnity as the Board or the Companys transfer agent may think fit and, in
case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company.

 



 

6.3 All certificates for share or loan capital or other securities of the
Company (other than letters of allotment, scrip certificates and other like
documents) shall, except to the extent that the terms and conditions for the
time being relating thereto otherwise provide, be in such form as the Board
may determine and issued under the Seal or signed by a Director, the Secretary
or any person authorised by the Board for that purpose. The Board may by
resolution determine, either generally or in any particular case, that any
signatures on any such certificates need not be autographic but may be affixed
to such certificates by some mechanical means or may be printed thereon or
that such certificates need not be signed by any persons, or may determine
that a representation of the Seal may be printed on any such certificates. If
any person

 



      
 

 



 

holding an office in the Company who has signed, or whose facsimile signature
has been used on, any certificate ceases for any reason to hold his office,
such certificate may nevertheless be issued as though that person had not
ceased to hold such office.

 



 

6.4 Nothing in these Bye-Laws shall prevent title to any securities of the
Company from being evidenced and/or transferred without a written instrument
in accordance with regulations made from time to time in this regard under the
Companies Acts, and the Board or the Companys transfer agent shall have power
to implement any arrangements which it may think fit for such evidencing
and/or transfer which accord with those regulations.

 



 

7. **LIEN**

 



 

7.1 The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not
being a fully paid share) for all monies, whether presently payable or not,
called or payable, at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue
of such share in respect of such share, and the Company shall also have a
first and paramount lien on every share (other than a fully paid share)
standing registered in the name of a Shareholder, whether singly or jointly
with any other person, for all the debts and liabilities of such Shareholder
or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before
or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such
Shareholder, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same
shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are
joint debts or liabilities of such Shareholder or his estate and any other
person, whether a Shareholder or not. The Companys lien on a share shall
extend to all dividends payable thereon. The Board may at any time, either
generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare
any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Bye-Law.

 



 

7.2 The Company may sell, in such manner as the Board may think fit, any share
on which the Company has a lien but no sale shall be made unless some sum in
respect of which the lien exists is presently payable nor until the expiration
of fourteen (14) days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment
of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in
default of such payment, has been served on the holder for the time being of
the share.

 



 

7.3 The net proceeds of sale by the Company of any shares on which it has a
lien shall be applied in or towards payment or discharge of the debt or
liability in respect of which the lien exists so far as the same is presently
payable, and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or
liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale)
be paid to the person who was the holder of the share immediately before such
sale. For giving effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person
to transfer the share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be
registered as the holder of the share and he shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the share be
affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the
sale.

 



      
 

 



 

7.4 Subject to the rights conferred upon the holders of any class of shares,
nothing herein contained shall prejudice or affect any right or remedy which
any law may confer or purport to confer on the Company and as between the
Company and every such Shareholder as aforesaid, his estate representative,
executor, administrator and estate wheresoever constituted or situate, any
right or remedy which such law shall confer or purport to confer on the
Company shall be enforceable by the Company.

 



 

8. **CALLS ON SHARES**

 



 

8.1 The Board may from time to time make calls upon the Shareholders (for the
avoidance of doubt excluding the Company in respect of any nil or partly paid
shares held by the Company as treasury shares) in respect of any monies unpaid
on their shares (whether on account of the par value of the shares or by way
of premium) and not by the terms of issue thereof made payable at a date fixed
by or in accordance with such terms of issue, and each Shareholder shall
(subject to the Company serving upon him at least fourteen (14) days prior
notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company
at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares. A
call may be revoked or postponed as the Board may determine.

 



 

8.2 A call may be made payable by instalments and shall be deemed to have been
made at the time when the resolution of the Board authorising the call was
passed.

 



 

8.3 The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay
all calls in respect thereof.

 



 

8.4 If a sum called in respect of the share shall not be paid before or on the
day appointed for payment thereof the person from whom the sum is due shall
pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for the payment thereof to the
time of actual payment at such rate as the Board may determine, but the Board
shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.

 



 

8.5 Any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable on
allotment or at any date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue,
whether on account of the nominal amount of the share or by way of premium,
shall for all the purposes of these Bye-Laws be deemed to be a call duly made,
notified and payable on the date on which, by the terms of issue, the same
becomes payable and, in case of non-payment, all the relevant provisions of
these Bye-Laws as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply
as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

 



 

8.6 The Board may on the issue of shares differentiate between the allottees
or holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.

 



      
 

 



 

9. **FORFEITURE OF SHARES**

 



 

9.1 If a Shareholder fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day
appointed for payment thereof, the Board may at any time thereafter during
such time as any part of such call or instalment remains unpaid serve a notice
on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid,
together with any interest which may have accrued.

 



 

9.2 The notice shall name a further day (not being less than fourteen (14)
days from the date of the notice) on or before which, and the place where, the
payment required by the notice is to be made and shall state that, in the
event of non-payment on or before the day and at the place appointed, the
shares in respect of which such call is made or instalment is payable will be
liable to be forfeited. The Board may accept the surrender of any share liable
to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references in these Bye-Laws to
forfeiture shall include surrender.

 



 

9.3 If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with,
any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at any time
thereafter, before payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in
respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to
that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect
of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture.

 



 

9.4 When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be
served upon the person who was before forfeiture the holder of the share but
no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or neglect to
give such notice as aforesaid.

 



 

9.5 A forfeited share shall be deemed to be the property of the Company and
may be sold, re-offered or otherwise disposed of either to the person who was,
before forfeiture, the holder thereof or entitled thereto or to any other
person upon such terms and in such manner as the Board shall think fit, and at
any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be
cancelled on such terms as the Board may think fit.

 



 

9.6 A person whose shares have been forfeited shall thereupon cease to be a
Shareholder in respect of the forfeited shares but shall, notwithstanding the
forfeiture, remain liable to pay to the Company all monies which at the date
of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of the
shares with interest thereon at such rate as the Board may determine from the
date of forfeiture until payment, and the Company may enforce payment without
being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the shares
forfeited.

 



 

9.7 An affidavit in writing that the deponent is a Director of the Company or
the Secretary and that a share has been duly forfeited on the date stated in
the affidavit shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as
against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share. The Company may
receive the consideration (if any) given for the share on the sale, re-
allotment or disposition thereof and the Board may authorise some person to
transfer the share to the person to whom the same is sold, re-allotted or
disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the share
and shall not be bound to see to the application of the

 



      
 

 



 

purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the share be affected by any
irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the forfeiture,
sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share.

 



 

 **REGISTER OF SHAREHOLDERS**

 



 

10. **REGISTER OF SHAREHOLDERS**

 



 

10.1 The Register shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other
place in Bermuda as the Board may from time to time direct, in the manner
prescribed by the Companies Acts. Subject to the provisions of the Companies
Acts, the Company may keep one or more overseas or branch registers in any
place, and the Board may make, amend and revoke any such regulations as it may
think fit respecting the keeping of such registers. The Board may authorise
any share on the Register to be included in a branch register or any share
registered on a branch register to be registered on another branch register,
provided that at all times the Register is maintained in accordance with the
Companies Acts.

 



 

10.2 The Register or any branch register may be closed at such times and for
such period as the Board may from time to time decide, subject to the
Companies Acts. Except during such time as it is closed, the Register and each
branch register shall be open to inspection in the manner prescribed by the
Companies Acts between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon (or between such other times
as the Board from time to time determines) on every working day. Unless the
Board so determines, no Shareholder or intending Shareholder shall be entitled
to have entered in the Register or any branch register any indication of any
trust or any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or
any fractional part of a share and if any such entry exists or is permitted by
the Board it shall not be deemed to abrogate any of the provisions of Bye-Law
5.5.

 



 

 **REGISTER OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS**

 



 

11. **REGISTER OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS**

 **TRANSFER OF SHARES**

 



 

12. **TRANSFER OF SHARES**

 



 

12.1 Subject to the Companies Acts and to such of the restrictions contained
in these Bye-Laws as may be applicable, any Shareholder may transfer all or
any of his shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual common form, in
any other form which the Board may approve, or,

 



      
 

 



 

provided such shares are listed on an Appointed Stock Exchange, by any means
permitted by the rules of such exchange.

 



 

12.2 Subject to Bye-Law 12.1, any instrument of transfer of a share shall be
signed by or on behalf of the transferor and where any share is not fully-
paid, the transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of
the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in
respect thereof. All instruments of transfer when registered may be retained
by the Company. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without
assigning any reason therefor, decline to register any transfer of any share
which is not a fully-paid share. The Board may also decline to register any
transfer unless such shares are listed on an Appointed Stock Exchange or:

 



 

12.2.1 the instrument of transfer is duly stamped (if required by law) and
lodged with the Company or the Companys transfer agent, at such place as the
Board shall appoint for the purpose, accompanied by the certificate for the
shares (if any has been issued) to which it relates, and such other evidence
as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to
make the transfer,

 



 

12.2.2 the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share,

 



 

12.2.3 the instrument of transfer is in favour of less than five (5) persons
jointly; and

 



 

12.2.4 it is satisfied that all applicable consents, authorisations,
permissions or approvals of any governmental body or agency in Bermuda or any
other applicable jurisdiction required to be obtained under relevant law prior
to such transfer have been obtained.

 



 

12.3 Subject to any directions of the Board from time to time in force, the
Secretary or the Companys transfer agent may exercise the powers and
discretions of the Board under this Bye-Law.

 



 

12.4 If the Board declines to register a transfer it shall, within three (3)
months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to
the transferee notice of such refusal.

 



 

12.5 No fee shall be charged by the Company for registering any transfer,
probate, letters of administration, certificate of death or marriage, power of
attorney, order of court or other instrument relating to or affecting the
title to any share, or otherwise making an entry in the Register relating to
any share, (except that the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed on it in
connection with such transfer or entry).

 



      
 

 



 

 **TRANSMISSION OF SHARES**

 



 

13. **TRANSMISSION OF SHARES**

 



 

13.1 In the case of the death of a Shareholder, the survivor or survivors,
where the deceased was a joint holder, and the estate representative, where he
was sole holder, shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having
any title to his shares; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate
of a deceased holder (whether the sole or joint) from any liability in respect
of any share held by him solely or jointly with other persons. For the purpose
of this Bye-Law, estate representative means the person to whom probate or
letters of administration has or have been granted in Bermuda or, failing any
such person, such other person as the Board may in its absolute discretion
determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this
Bye-Law.

 



 

13.2 Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death of a
Shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law may, subject as
hereafter provided and upon such evidence being produced as may from time to
time be required by the Board as to his entitlement, either be registered
himself as the holder of the share or elect to have some person nominated by
him registered as the transferee thereof. If the person so becoming entitled
elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to the Company a
notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect
to have his nominee registered, he shall signify his election by signing an
instrument of transfer of such share in favour of his nominee. All the
limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Bye-Laws relating to the
right to transfer and the registration of transfer of shares shall be
applicable to any such notice or instrument of transfer as aforesaid as if the
death of the Shareholder or other event giving rise to the transmission had
not occurred and the notice or instrument of transfer was an instrument of
transfer signed by such Shareholder.

 



 

13.3 A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death of a
Shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law shall (upon such
evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the Board as
to his entitlement) be entitled to receive and may give a discharge for any
dividends or other monies payable in respect of the share, but he shall not be
entitled in respect of the share to receive notices of or to attend or vote at
general meetings of the Company or, save as aforesaid, to exercise in respect
of the share any of the rights or privileges of a Shareholder until he shall
have become registered as the holder thereof. The Board may at any time give
notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to
transfer the share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty (60)
days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends and other
monies payable in respect of the shares until the requirements of the notice
have been complied with.

 



 

13.4 Subject to any directions of the Board from time to time in force, the
Secretary may exercise the powers and discretions of the Board under this Bye-
Law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SHARE CAPITAL**

 



 

14. **INCREASE OF CAPITAL**

 



 

14.1 The Company may from time to time increase its capital by such sum to be
divided into shares of such par value as the Company by Resolution shall
prescribe.

 



 

14.2 The Company may, by the Resolution increasing the capital, direct that
the new shares or any of them shall be offered in the first instance either at
par or at a premium or (subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts) at a
discount to all the holders for the time being of shares of any class or
classes in proportion to the number of such shares held by them respectively
or make any other provision as to the issue of the new shares.

 



 

14.3 The new shares shall be subject to all the provisions of these Bye-Laws
with reference to lien, the payment of calls, forfeiture, transfer,
transmission and otherwise.

 



 

15. **ALTERATION OF CAPITAL**

 



 

15.1 The Company may from time to time by Resolution:

 



 

15.1.1 divide its shares into several classes and attach thereto respectively
any preferential, deferred, qualified or special rights, privileges or
conditions;

 



 

15.1.2 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of
larger par value than its existing shares;

 



 

15.1.3 sub-divide its shares or any of them into shares of smaller par value
than is fixed by its memorandum, so, however, that in the sub-division the
proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each
reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which
the reduced share is derived;

 



 

15.1.4 make provision for the issue and allotment of shares which do not carry
any voting rights;

 



 

15.1.5 cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the Resolution in
that behalf, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and
diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so
cancelled; and

 



 

15.1.6 change the currency denomination of its share capital.

 



 

15.2 Where any difficulty arises in regard to any division, consolidation, or
sub-division under this Bye-Law, the Board may settle the same as it thinks
expedient and, in particular, may arrange for the sale of the shares
representing fractions and the distribution of the net proceeds of sale in due
proportion amongst the Shareholders who would have been entitled to the
fractions, and for this purpose the Board may authorise some person to
transfer the shares representing fractions to the purchaser thereof, who shall
not be bound to see to the application of the

 



      
 

 



 

purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any
irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale.

 



 

15.3 Subject to the Companies Acts and to any confirmation or consent required
by law or these Bye-Laws, the Company may by Resolution from time to time
convert any preference shares into redeemable preference shares.

 



 

16. **REDUCTION OF CAPITAL**

 



 

16.1 Subject to the Companies Acts, its memorandum and any confirmation or
consent required by law or these Bye-Laws, the Company may from time to time
by Resolution authorise the reduction of its issued share capital or any share
premium account in any manner.

 



 

16.2 In relation to any such reduction, the Company may by Resolution
determine the terms upon which such reduction is to be effected including, in
the case of a reduction of part only of a class of shares, those shares to be
affected.

 



 

 **GENERAL MEETINGS AND RESOLUTIONS IN WRITING**

 



 

17. **GENERAL MEETINGS AND RESOLUTIONS IN WRITING**

 



 

17.1 The Board shall convene and the Company shall hold general meetings as
Annual General Meetings in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Acts at such times and places as the Board shall appoint. The Board may,
whenever it thinks fit, and shall, when requisitioned by Shareholders pursuant
to the provisions of the Companies Acts, convene general meetings other than
Annual General Meetings, which shall be called Special General Meetings, at
such time and place as the Board may appoint.

 



 

17.2 No action that is required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders
of the Company at any annual or special meeting of Shareholders may be
effected by written consent of Shareholders in lieu of a meeting of
Shareholders.

 



       
 

 



 

18. **NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS**

 



 

18.1 An Annual General Meeting shall be called by not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) clear days prior notice in writing and a Special General
Meeting shall be called by not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60)
clear days prior notice in writing. The notice shall specify the place, day
and time of the meeting, (including any satellite meeting place arranged for
the purposes of Bye-Law 19) and, the nature of the business to be considered.
Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner permitted by
these Bye-Laws to all Shareholders other than such as, under the provisions of
these Bye-Laws or the terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled
to receive such notice from the Company and to each Director, and to any
Resident Representative who or which has delivered a written notice upon the
Registered Office requiring that such notice be sent to him or it.

 



 

18.2 The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting or (in cases where
instruments of proxy are sent out with the notice) the accidental omission to
send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting or
such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall
not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

 



 

18.3 A Shareholder present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of
the Company or of the holders of any class of shares in the Company shall be
deemed to have received notice of the meeting and, where requisite, of the
purposes for which it was called.

 



 

18.4 The Board may cancel or postpone a meeting of the Shareholders after it
has been convened and notice of such cancellation or postponement shall be
served in accordance with these Bye-Laws upon all Shareholders entitled to
notice of the meeting so cancelled or postponed setting out, where the meeting
is postponed to a specific date, notice of the new meeting in accordance with
this Bye-Law.

 



 

19. **GENERAL MEETINGS AT MORE THAN ONE PLACE**

 



 

19.1 The provisions of this Bye-Law shall apply if any general meeting is
convened at or adjourned to more than one place.

 



 

19.2 The notice of any meeting or adjourned meeting may specify the Specified
Place and the Board shall make arrangements for simultaneous attendance and
participation in a satellite meeting at other places (whether adjoining the
Specified Place or in a different and separate place or places altogether or
otherwise) by Shareholders. The Shareholders present at any such satellite
meeting place in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be counted in
the quorum for, and shall be entitled to vote at, the general meeting in
question if the chairman of the general meeting is satisfied that adequate
facilities are available throughout the general meeting to ensure that
Shareholders attending at all the meeting places are able to:

 



 

19.2.1 communicate simultaneously and instantaneously with the persons present
at the other meeting place or places, whether by use of microphones, loud-
speakers, audio-visual or other communications equipment or facilities; and

 



      
 

 



 

19.2.2 have access to all documents which are required by the Companies Acts
and these Bye-Laws to be made available at the meeting.

 



 

19.3 The chairman of the general meeting shall be present at, and the meeting
shall be deemed to take place at, the Specified Place. If it appears to the
chairman of the general meeting that the facilities at the Specified Place or
any satellite meeting place are or become inadequate for the purposes referred
to above, then the chairman may, without the consent of the meeting, interrupt
or adjourn the general meeting. All business conducted at that general meeting
up to the time of such adjournment shall be valid.

 



 

19.4 The Board may from time to time make such arrangements for the purpose of
controlling the level of attendance at any such satellite meeting (whether
involving the issue of tickets or the imposition of some means of selection or
otherwise) as they shall in their absolute discretion consider appropriate,
and may from time to time vary any such arrangements or make new arrangements
in place of them, provided that a Shareholder who is not entitled to attend,
in person or by proxy, at any particular place shall be entitled so to attend
at one of the other places and the entitlement of any Shareholder so to attend
the meeting or adjourned meeting at such place shall be subject to any such
arrangements as may be for the time being in force and by the notice of
meeting or adjourned meeting stated to apply to the meeting.

 



 

19.5 If a meeting is adjourned to more than one place, notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given in the manner required by Bye-Law 18.

 



 

20. **PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS**

 



 

20.1 In accordance with the Companies Acts, a general meeting may be held with
only one individual present provided that the requirement for a quorum is
satisfied. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a
quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a
quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman,
which shall not be treated as part of the business of the meeting. Save as
otherwise provided by these Bye-Laws, at least two (2) Shareholders present in
person or by proxy and entitled to vote representing the holders of a majority
of the issued shares entitled to vote at such meeting shall be a quorum for
all purposes; provided, however, that if the Company or a class of
Shareholders shall have only one Shareholder, one Shareholder present in
person or by proxy shall constitute the necessary quorum.

 



      
 

 



 

20.2 If within five (5) minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the
meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a
quorum is not present or represented, the meeting, if convened on the
requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall
stand adjourned to such other day and such other time and place as (i) a
majority of the members of the Board, or (ii) the Shareholders present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereat, by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued shares
present, may determine. At such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be
present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
Shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 



 

20.3 A meeting of the Shareholders or any class thereof may be held by means
of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone, or by video
conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to
communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and
participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting. If it appears to the chairman of a general meeting that the Specified
Place is inadequate to accommodate all persons entitled and wishing to attend,
the meeting is duly constituted and its proceedings are valid if the chairman
is satisfied that adequate facilities are available, whether at the Specified
Place or elsewhere, to ensure that each such person who is unable to be
accommodated at the Specified Place is able to communicate simultaneously and
instantaneously with the persons present at the Specified Place, whether by
the use of microphones, loud-speakers, audio-visual or other communications
equipment or facilities.

 



 

20.4 Subject to the Companies Acts, a resolution may only be put to a vote at
a general meeting of the Company or of any class of Shareholders if:

 



 

20.4.1 it is proposed by or at the direction of the Board; or

 



 

20.4.2 it is proposed at the direction of the Court; or

 



 

20.4.3 it is proposed on the requisition in writing of such number of
Shareholders as is prescribed by, and is made in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the Companies Acts; or

 



 

20.4.4 the chairman of the meeting in his absolute discretion decides that the
resolution may properly be regarded as within the scope of the meeting.

 



 

20.5 In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be
properly brought before an Annual General Meeting by a Shareholder, such
Shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to
the Secretary of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

20.6 To be timely, a Shareholders notice to the Secretary must be delivered
to or be mailed and received at the Registered Office(1) of the Company not
less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior
to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual General Meeting;
provided, however, that in the event that the Annual General Meeting is called
for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such
anniversary date, notice by the Shareholder in order to be timely must be so
received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual General
Meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the Annual General
Meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or
postponement of an Annual General Meeting, or the public announcement of such
an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of a Shareholders notice as described above.

 



 

20.7 To be in proper written form, a Shareholders notice to the Secretary
must set forth the following information: (a) as to each matter such
Shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual General Meeting, a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the Annual General
Meeting and the proposed text of any proposal regarding such business
(including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, if such
business includes a proposal to amend these Bye-Laws, the text of the proposed
amendment), and the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual General
Meeting, and (b) as to the Shareholder giving notice and the beneficial owner,
if any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (i) the name and address
of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of the
Company which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any
affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder
of all shares of the Company owned beneficially but not of record by such
person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such
shares of the Company held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the
extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short
interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into
by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such
person, with respect to shares of the Company and (D) whether and the extent
to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding
(including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of the
Company) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or
associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being
to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of share price changes for,
such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or
decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or
any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to shares of the
Company; (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or
understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any
affiliates or associates of such person, and any other person or persons
(including their names) in connection with or relating to (A) the Company or
(B) the proposal, including any material interest in, or anticipated benefit
from the proposal to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such
person, (iv) a

  (1) _Note to Atlantic_ : If notices are to be given to the Secretary, then
they should be delivered to the Registered Office rather than the executive
offices.

 



      
 

 



 

representation that the Shareholder giving notice intends to appear in person
or by proxy at the Annual General Meeting to bring such business before the
meeting; and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be
required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be
made in connection with the solicitation of proxies by such person with
respect to the proposed business to be brought by such person before the
Annual General Meeting pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the **Exchange Act** ), and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



 

20.8 A Shareholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before
an Annual General Meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if
necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such
notice pursuant to this Bye-Law 20 shall be true and correct as of the record
date for determining the Shareholders entitled to receive notice of the Annual
General Meeting and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be
mailed and received by the Secretary at the Registered Office of the Company
not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining
the Shareholders entitled to receive notice of the Annual General Meeting.

 



 

20.9 No business shall be conducted at the Annual General Meeting except
business brought before the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Bye-Law 20; provided, however, that, once
business has been properly brought before the Annual General Meeting in
accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Bye-Law 20 shall be deemed to
preclude discussion by any Shareholder of any such business. If the chairman
of an Annual General Meeting determines that business was not properly brought
before the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures,
the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly
brought before the meeting and such business shall not be discussed or
transacted.

 



 

20.10 Nothing contained in this Bye-Law 20 shall be deemed to affect any
rights of Shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Companys
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (or any
successor provision of law).

 



 

20.11 No amendment may be made to a resolution, at or before the time when it
is put to a vote, unless the chairman of the meeting in his absolute
discretion decides that the amendment or the amended resolution may properly
be put to a vote at that meeting.

 



 

20.12 If the chairman of the meeting rules a resolution or an amendment to a
resolution admissible or out of order (as the case may be), the proceedings of
the meeting or on the resolution in question shall not be invalidated by any
error in his ruling. Any ruling by the chairman of the meeting in relation to
a resolution or an amendment to a resolution shall be final and conclusive.

 



 

20.13 The Resident Representative, if any, upon giving the notice referred to
in Bye-Law 18.1 above, shall be entitled to attend any general meeting of the
Company and each Director shall be entitled to attend and speak at any general
meeting of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

20.14 The Board may choose one of their number to preside as chairman at every
general meeting. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting the
chairman is not present within five (5) minutes after the time appointed for
holding the meeting, or is not willing to act as chairman, the Directors
present shall choose one of their number to act or if only one Director is
present he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is
present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the
persons present and entitled to vote on a poll shall elect one of their number
to be chairman.

 



 

20.15 The chairman of the meeting may, with the consent by resolution of any
meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the
meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time (or sine die) and from place
to place but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except
business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting from which
the adjournment took place. In addition to any other power of adjournment
conferred by law, the chairman of the meeting may at any time without consent
of the meeting adjourn the meeting (whether or not it has commenced or a
quorum is present) to another time and/or place (or sine die) if, in his
opinion, it would facilitate the conduct of the business of the meeting to do
so or if he is so directed (prior to or at the meeting) by the Board. When a
meeting is adjourned sine die, the time and place for the adjourned meeting
shall be fixed by the Board. When a meeting is adjourned for three (3) months
or more or for an indefinite period, not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) clear days prior notice shall be given of the adjourned meeting.
Save as expressly provided by these Bye-Laws, it shall not be necessary to
give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an
adjourned meeting.

 



 

21. **VOTING**

 



 

21.1 Save where a greater majority is required by the Companies Acts or these
Bye-Laws, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall
be decided on by a simple majority of votes cast.

 



 

21.2 Subject to Bye-Law 38.1 and to any rights or restrictions attached to any
class of shares, at any meeting of the Company, each Shareholder present in
person shall be entitled to one vote on any question to be decided on a show
of hands and each Shareholder present in person or by proxy shall be entitled
on a poll to one vote for each share held by him.

 



 

21.3 At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall
be decided on a show of hands or by a count of votes received in the form of
electronic records, unless (before or on the declaration of the result of the
show of hands or count of votes received as electronic records or on the
withdrawal of any other demand for a poll) a poll is demanded by:

 



 

21.3.1 the chairman of the meeting; or

 



 

21.3.2 at least three (3) Shareholders present in person or represented by
proxy; or

 



      
 

 



 

21.3.3 any Shareholder or Shareholders present in person or represented by
proxy and holding between them not less than one tenth (1/10) of the total
voting rights of all the Shareholders having the right to vote at such
meeting; or

 



 

21.3.4 a Shareholder or Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy
holding shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being shares on
which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth
(1/10) of the total sum paid up on all such shares conferring such right.

 



 

The demand for a poll may, before the poll is taken, be withdrawn but only
with the consent of the chairman and a demand so withdrawn shall not be taken
to have invalidated the result of a show of hands or count of votes received
as electronic records declared before the demand was made. If the demand for a
poll is withdrawn, the chairman or any other Shareholder entitled may demand a
poll.

 



 

21.4 Unless a poll is so demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a
declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands or count
of votes received as electronic records, been carried or carried unanimously
or by a particular majority or not carried by a particular majority or lost
shall be final and conclusive, and an entry to that effect in the minute book
of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the
number or proportion of votes recorded for or against such resolution.

 



 

21.5 If a poll is duly demanded, the result of the poll shall be deemed to be
the resolution of the meeting at which the poll is demanded.

 



 

21.6 A poll demanded on the election of a chairman, or on a question of
adjournment, shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question
shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time (being not
later than three (3) months after the date of the demand) and place as the
chairman shall direct and he may appoint scrutineers (who need not be
Shareholders) and fix a time and place for declaring the result of the poll.
It shall not be necessary (unless the chairman otherwise directs) for notice
to be given of a poll.

 



 

21.7 The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for
the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has
been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the
meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier.

 



 

21.8 On a poll, votes may be cast either personally or by proxy.

 



 

21.9 A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his
votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.

 



 

21.10 In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a
show of hands or count of votes received as electronic records or on a poll,
the chairman of such meeting shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote
and the resolution shall fail.

 



      
 

 



 

21.11 In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who
tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the
exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and for this purpose
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the
Register in respect of the joint holding.

 



 

21.12 A Shareholder who is a patient for any purpose of any statute or
applicable law relating to mental health or in respect of whom an order has
been made by any Court having jurisdiction for the protection or management of
the affairs of persons incapable of managing their own affairs may vote,
whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator
bonis or other person in the nature of a receiver, committee or curator bonis
appointed by such Court and such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other
person may vote on a poll by proxy, and may otherwise act and be treated as
such Shareholder for the purpose of general meetings.

 



 

21.13 No Shareholder shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be entitled
to vote at any general meeting unless all calls or other sums presently
payable by him in respect of shares in the Company have been paid.

 



 

21.14 If:

 



 

21.14.1 any objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter; or,

 



 

21.14.2 any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or
which might have been rejected; or,

 



 

21.14.3 any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted, the
objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or adjourned
meeting on any resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the
meeting or, as the case may be, the adjourned meeting at which the vote
objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs. Any objection
or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and shall only
vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides
that the same may have affected the decision of the meeting. The decision of
the chairman on such matters shall be final and conclusive.

 



 

22. **PROXIES AND CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES**

 



 

22.1 A Shareholder may appoint one or more persons as his proxy, with or
without the power of substitution, to represent him and vote on his behalf in
respect of all or some only of his shares at any general meeting (including an
adjourned meeting). A proxy need not be a Shareholder. The instrument
appointing a proxy shall be in writing executed by the appointor or his
attorney authorised by him in writing or, if the appointor is a corporation,
either under its seal or executed by an officer, attorney or other person
authorised to sign the same.

 



 

22.2 A Shareholder which is a corporation may, by written authorisation,
appoint any person (or two (2) or more persons in the alternative) as its
representative to represent it and vote on its

 



      
 

 



 

behalf at any general meeting (including an adjourned meeting) and such a
corporate representative may exercise the same powers on behalf of the
corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were
an individual Shareholder and the Shareholder shall for the purposes of these
Bye-Laws be deemed to be present in person at any such meeting if a person so
authorised is present at it.

 



 

22.3 Any Shareholder may appoint a proxy or (if a corporation) representative
for a specific general meeting, and adjournments thereof, or may appoint a
standing proxy or (if a corporation) representative, by serving on the Company
at the Registered Office, or at such place or places as the Board may
otherwise specify for the purpose, a proxy or (if a corporation) an
authorisation. Any standing proxy or authorisation shall be valid for all
general meetings and adjournments thereof or resolutions in writing, as the
case may be, until notice of revocation is received at the Registered Office
or at such place or places as the Board may otherwise specify for the purpose.
Where a standing proxy or authorisation exists, its operation shall be deemed
to have been suspended at any general meeting or adjournment thereof at which
the Shareholder is present or in respect to which the Shareholder has
specially appointed a proxy or representative. The Board may from time to time
require such evidence as it shall deem necessary as to the due execution and
continuing validity of any standing proxy or authorisation and the operation
of any such standing proxy or authorisation shall be deemed to be suspended
until such time as the Board determines that it has received the requested
evidence or other evidence satisfactory to it.

 



 

22.4 Subject to Bye-Law 22.3, the instrument appointing a proxy or corporate
representative together with such other evidence as to its due execution as
the Board may from time to time require, shall be delivered at the Registered
Office (or at such place or places as may be specified in the notice convening
the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in either case or the case
of a resolution in writing, in any document sent therewith) by 11:59p.m., New
York time, on the day prior to the date of the relevant meeting or adjourned
meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote (or such
other date and time as the Board may determine) or, in the case of a poll
taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, before the
time appointed for the taking of the poll, or, in the case of a resolution in
writing, prior to the effective date of the resolution in writing and in
default the instrument of proxy or authorisation shall not be treated as
valid.

 



 

22.5 Instruments of proxy or authorisation shall be in any common form or in
such other form as the Board may approve and the Board may, if it thinks fit,
send out with the notice of any meeting or any resolution in writing forms of
instruments of proxy or authorisation for use at that meeting or in connection
with that resolution in writing. The instrument of proxy shall be deemed to
confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll, to speak at the
meeting and to vote on any amendment of a resolution in writing or amendment
of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks
fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation shall, unless the contrary is
stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the
meeting to which it relates. If the terms of the appointment of a proxy
include a

 



      
 

 



 

power of substitution, any proxy appointed by substitution under such power
shall be deemed to be the proxy of the Shareholder who conferred such power.
All the provisions of these Bye-Laws relating to the execution and delivery of
an instrument or other form of communication appointing or evidencing the
appointment of a proxy shall apply, mutates mutandis, to the instrument or
other form of communication effecting or evidencing such an appointment by
substitution.

 



 

22.6 A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy or
authorisation shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or unsoundness
of mind of the principal, or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of the
corporate authority, provided that no intimation in writing of such death,
unsoundness of mind or revocation shall have been received by the Company at
the Registered Office (or such other place as may be specified for the
delivery of instruments of proxy or authorisation in the notice convening the
meeting or other documents sent therewith) at least one hour before the
commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or the taking of the poll,
or the day before the effective date of any resolution in writing at which the
instrument of proxy or authorisation is used.

 



 

22.7 Subject to the Companies Acts, the Board may at its discretion waive any
of the provisions of these Bye-Laws related to proxies or authorisations and,
in particular, may accept such verbal or other assurances as it thinks fit as
to the right of any person to attend, speak and vote on behalf of any
Shareholder at general meetings or to sign resolutions in writing.

23. **APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

23.1 Each Director shall (unless his office is vacated in accordance with
these Bye-Laws) serve initially until the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting of the Company held in the calendar year 20 [ ] and subsequently shall

meeting and is lost.

 



 

23.3 If the Company, at the meeting at which a Director (of any class) retires
by rotation or otherwise, does not fill the vacancy, the retiring Director

re-appointment of the Director is put to the meeting and lost.

 



 

23.4 Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Company.

General Meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred
twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding
Annual General Meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the Annual
General Meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days

notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to
being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.

supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or
required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Bye-Law 23 shall be

23.8 No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Company
unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bye-Law
23. If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made
in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the
meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall
be disregarded.

 



 

23.9 Except as otherwise authorised by the Companies Acts, the appointment of
any person proposed as a Director shall be effected by a separate Resolution.

 



 

23.10 All Directors, upon election or appointment, except upon re-election or

23.11 The number of Directors shall be not less than three (3) and not more
than fifteen (15) or such number in excess thereof as the Board by resolution
may from time to time determine. Any one or more vacancies in the Board not
filled at any general meeting shall be deemed casual vacancies for the
purposes of these Bye-Laws. Without prejudice to the power of the Company by
Resolution in pursuance of any of the provisions of these Bye-Laws to appoint
any person to be a Director, the Board, so long as a quorum of Directors
remains in office, shall have power at any time and from time to time, to
appoint any individual to be a Director so as to fill a casual vacancy. A
Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following Annual

 



      
 

 



 

General Meeting and shall not be taken into account in determining the

that his office is vacated;

 



 

24.1.3 if he becomes bankrupt under the laws of any country or compounds with
his creditors;

 



 

24.1.4 if he is prohibited by law from being a Director; or

Bye-Laws or is removed from office pursuant to Section 93 of the Companies Act
1981 (as amended) of Bermuda

 



 

25. **RESERVED**

 



 

26. **DIRECTORS  INTERESTS**

 



 

26.1 A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company
(except that of auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such
period and upon such terms as the Board may determine, and may be paid such
extra remuneration therefor (whether by way of salary, commission,
participation in profits or otherwise) as the Board may determine, and such
extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for by or
pursuant to any other Bye-Law.

 



 

26.2 A Director may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for
the Company (otherwise than as auditor) and he or his firm shall be entitled
to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director.

 



 

26.3 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, a Director may
notwithstanding his office be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any
transaction or arrangement with the Company or in which the Company is
otherwise interested; and be a director or other officer of, or employed by,
or a party to any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in,
any body

 



      
 

 



 

corporate promoted by the Company or in which the Company is interested. The
Board may also cause the voting power conferred by the shares in any other
company held or owned by the Company to be exercised in such manner in all
respects as it thinks fit, including the exercise thereof in favour of any
resolution appointing the Directors or any of them to be directors or officers
of such other company, or voting or providing for the payment of remuneration
to the directors or officers of such other company.

 



 

26.4 So long as, where it is necessary, he declares the nature of his interest
at the first opportunity at a meeting of the Board or by writing to the
Directors as required by the Companies Acts, a Director shall not by reason of
his office be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from
any office or employment to which these Bye-Laws allow him to be appointed or
from any transaction or arrangement in which these Bye-Laws allow him to be
interested, and no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be
avoided on the ground of any interest or benefit.

 



 

26.5 Subject to the Companies Acts and any further disclosure required
thereby, a general notice to the Directors by a Director or Officer declaring
that he is a director or officer or has an interest in a person and is to be
regarded as interested in any transaction or arrangement made with that
person, shall be a sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any
transaction or arrangement so made.

 



 

26.6 For the purposes of these Bye-Laws, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, a Director is deemed to have an interest in a transaction or
arrangement with the Company if he is the holder of or beneficially interested
in [ ] per cent or more of any class of the equity share capital of any body
corporate (or any other body corporate through which his interest is derived)
or of the voting rights available to members of the relevant body corporate
with which the Company is proposing to enter into a transaction or
arrangement, provided that there shall be disregarded any shares held by such
Director as bare or custodian trustee and in which he has no beneficial
interest, any shares comprised in a trust in which the Directors interest is
in reversion or remainder if and so long as some other person is entitled to
receive the income thereof, and any shares comprised in an authorised unit
trust in which the Director is only interested as a unit holder. For the
purposes of this Bye-Law, an interest of a person who is connected with a
Director shall be treated as an interest of the Director.

 



 

26.7 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and provided, where
required under the Companies Acts, the interested Director declares his
interest:

 



 

26.7.1 the Company, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any
interest or expectancy of the Company and its subsidiaries in, or in being
offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from
time to time presented to any of the Sponsor Shareholders or any of their
respective officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners,
affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the Company and its subsidiaries),
even if the opportunity is one that the Company or its subsidiaries might
reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had

 



      
 

 



 

the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so and no
such Person shall be liable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (for
breach of any duty or otherwise), as a director or officer or otherwise, by
reason of the fact that such Person pursues or acquires such business
opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another Person or fails to
present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business
opportunity, to the Company or its subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to any such Person who is a Director or officer of
the Company, if such business opportunity is expressly offered to such
Director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a Director or
officer of the Company. Any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in any shares of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this Bye-Law 26.7.1. Neither the alteration,
amendment or repeal of this Bye-Law 26.7.1 nor the adoption of any provision
of these Bye-Laws inconsistent with this Bye-Law 26.7.1 shall eliminate or
reduce the effect of this Bye-Law 26.7.1 in respect of any matter occurring,
or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Bye-Law 26.7.1, would
accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption;

 



 

26.7.2 the Company hereby waives any claim or cause of action against the
Sponsor Shareholders and their respective officers, directors, agents,
stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries that may from
time to time arise in respect of a breach by any such Person of any duty,
obligation, right or interest disclaimed under Bye-Law 26.7.1; and

 



 

26.7.3 the provisions of this Bye-Law 26.7, to the extent that they restrict
the liabilities of the Sponsor Shareholders and their respective officers,
directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and
subsidiaries otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Company
to replace such other liabilities of such Persons.

 



 

27. **POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD**

 



 

27.1 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, these Bye-Laws and to
any directions given by the Company by Resolution, the Board shall manage the
business of the Company and may pay all expenses incurred in promoting and
incorporating the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company. No
alteration of these Bye-Laws and no such direction shall invalidate any prior
act of the Board which would have been valid if that alteration had not been
made or that direction had not been given. The powers given by this Bye-Law
shall not be limited by any special power given to the Board by these Bye-Laws
and a meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present shall be competent to
exercise all the powers, authorities and discretions for the time being vested
in or exercisable by the Board.

 



 

27.2 The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company except those powers
that are required by the Companies Acts or these Bye-Laws to be exercised by
the Shareholders.

 



      
 

 



 

27.3 All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other
instruments, whether negotiable or transferable or not, and all receipts for
money paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or
otherwise executed, as the case may be, in such manner as the Board shall from
time to time by resolution determine.

 



 

28. **FEES, GRATUITIES AND PENSIONS**

 



 

28.1 The ordinary remuneration of the Directors office for their services
(excluding amounts payable under any other provision of these Bye-Laws) shall
be determined by the Board and each such Director shall be paid a fee (which
shall be deemed to accrue from day to day) at such rate as may from time to
time be determined by the Board. Each Director shall be paid his reasonable
travel, hotel and incidental expenses in attending and returning from meetings
of the Board or committees constituted pursuant to these Bye-Laws or general
meetings and shall be paid all expenses properly and reasonably incurred by
him in the conduct of the Companys business or in the discharge of his duties
as a Director. Any Director who, by request, goes or resides abroad for any
purposes of the Company or who performs services which in the opinion of the
Board go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director may be paid such extra
remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits
or otherwise) as the Board may determine, and such extra remuneration shall be
in addition to any remuneration provided for by or pursuant to any other Bye-
Law.

 



 

28.2 In addition to its powers under Bye-Law 28.1 the Board may (by
establishment of or maintenance of schemes or otherwise) provide additional
benefits, whether by the payment of gratuities or pensions or by insurance or
otherwise, for any past or present Director or employee of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or any body corporate associated with, or any business
acquired by, any of them, and for any member of his family (including a spouse
and a former spouse) or any person who is or was dependent on him, and may (as
well before as after he ceases to hold such office or employment) contribute
to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or provision of any such
benefit.

 



 

28.3 No Director or former Director shall be accountable to the Company or the
Shareholders for any benefit provided pursuant to this Bye-Law and the receipt
of any such benefit shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a
Director of the Company.

 



 

29. **DELEGATION OF THE BOARD S POWERS**

 



 

29.1 The Board may by power of attorney appoint any company, firm or person or
any fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by
the Board, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes
and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested
in or exercisable by the Board under these Bye-Laws) and for such period and
subject to such conditions as it may think fit, and any such power of attorney
may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons
dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Board may think
fit, and may also authorise any such attorney to sub-delegate all or any of
the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him.

 



      
 

 



 

Such attorney may, if so authorised by the power of attorney, execute any
deed, instrument or other document on behalf of the Company.

 



 

29.2 The Board may entrust to and confer upon any Director, Officer or,
without prejudice to the provisions of Bye-Law 29.3, other person any of the
powers, authorities and discretions exercisable by it upon such terms and
conditions with such restrictions as it thinks fit, and either collaterally
with, or to the exclusion of, its own powers, authorities and discretions, and
may from time to time revoke or vary all or any of such powers, authorities
and discretions but no person dealing in good faith and without notice of such
revocation or variation shall be affected thereby.

 



 

29.3 When required under the requirements from time to time of any stock
exchange on which the shares of the Company are listed, the Board shall
appoint an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the requirements of such
stock exchange. The Board also may delegate any of its powers, authorities and
discretions to any other committees, consisting of such person or persons
(whether a member or members of its body or not) as it thinks fit. Any
committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers, authorities and
discretions so delegated, and in conducting its proceedings conform to any
regulations which may be imposed upon it by the Board. If no regulations are
imposed by the Board the proceedings of a committee with two (2) or more
members shall be, as far as is practicable, governed by the Bye-Laws
regulating the proceedings of the Board.

 



 

30. **PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD**

 



 

30.1 The Board may meet for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise
regulate its meetings as it thinks fit. Questions arising at any meeting shall
be determined by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes, the
motion shall be deemed to have been lost. A Director may, and the Secretary on
the requisition of a Director shall, at any time summon a meeting of the
Board.

 



 

30.2 Notice of a meeting of the Board may be given to a Director by word of
mouth or in any manner permitted by these Bye-Laws. A Director may
retrospectively waive the requirement for notice of any meeting by consenting
in writing to the business conducted at the meeting.

 



 

30.3 The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the Board may
be fixed by the Board and, unless so fixed at any other number, shall be a
majority of the members of the Board. Any Director who ceases to be a Director
at a meeting of the Board may continue to be present and to act as a Director
and, subject to Bye-Law 30.14, be counted in the quorum until the termination
of the meeting if no other Director objects and if otherwise a quorum of
Directors would not be present.

 



 

30.4 A Director who to his knowledge is in any way, whether directly or
indirectly, interested in a contract or proposed contract, transaction or
arrangement with the Company and has complied

 



      
 

 



 

with the provisions of the Companies Acts and these Bye-Laws with regard to
disclosure of his interest shall be entitled to vote in respect of any
contract, transaction or arrangement in which he is so interested and if he
shall do so his vote shall be counted, and he shall be taken into account in
ascertaining whether a quorum is present.

 



 

30.5 The Resident Representative shall, upon delivering written notice of an
address for the purposes of receipt of notice to the Registered Office, be
entitled to receive notice of, attend and be heard at and to receive minutes
of all meetings of the Board.

 



 

30.6 If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board, the
Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present.

 



 

30.7 So long as a quorum of Directors remains in office, the continuing
Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in the Board but, if no such
quorum remains, the continuing Directors or a sole continuing Director may act
only for the purpose of calling a general meeting.

 



 

30.8 Meetings of the Board shall be presided over by the non-executive
chairman of the Board (the **Chairman** ), who shall be chosen by a majority
vote of the Board. In the absence of the Chairman, meetings of the Board shall
be presided over by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Chairman
shall not have any more votes than any other director, nor shall the Chairman
have a casting or tie-breaking vote.

 



 

30.9 The meetings and proceedings of any committee consisting of two (2) or
more members shall be governed by the provisions contained in these Bye-Laws
for regulating the meetings and proceedings of the Board so far as the same
are applicable and are not superseded by any regulations imposed by the Board.

 



 

30.10 A resolution in writing signed by all the Directors for the time being
entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Board or by an Alternate
Director, as provided for in these Bye-Laws or by all the members of a
committee for the time being shall be as valid and effectual as a resolution
passed at a meeting of the Board or, as the case may be, of such committee
duly called and constituted. Such resolution may be contained in one document
or in several documents in the like form each signed by one or more of the
Directors or members of the committee concerned.

 



 

30.11 A meeting of the Board or a committee appointed by the Board may be held
by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities
(including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or
by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to
communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and
participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group
of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or,
if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is.

 



      
 

 



 

30.12 All acts done by the Board or by any committee or by any person acting
as a Director or member of a committee or any person duly authorised by the
Board or any committee shall, notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered
that there was some defect in the appointment of any member of the Board or
such committee or person acting as aforesaid or that they or any of them were
disqualified or had vacated their office, be as valid as if every such person
had been duly appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a Director,
member of such committee or person so authorised.

 



 

30.13 The Company may by resolution suspend or relax to any extent, either
generally or in respect of any particular matter, any provision of these Bye-
Laws prohibiting a Director from voting at a meeting of the Board or of a
committee of the Board, or ratify any transaction not duly authorised by
reason of a contravention of any such provisions.

 



 

30.14 Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment
(including fixing or varying the terms of appointment) of two (2) or more
Directors to offices or employments with the Company or any body corporate in
which the Company is interested, the proposals may be divided and considered
in relation to each Director separately and in such cases each of the
Directors concerned (if not debarred from voting under the provisions of Bye-
Law 30.4) shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the quorum in respect of
each resolution except that concerning his own appointment.

 



 

30.15 If a question arises at a meeting of the Board or a committee of the
Board as to the entitlement of a Director to vote or be counted in a quorum,
the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the
chairman of the meeting and his ruling in relation to any Director other than
himself shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or
extent of the interests of the Director concerned have not been fairly
disclosed. If any such question arises in respect of the chairman of the
meeting, it shall be decided by resolution of the Board (on which the chairman
shall not vote) and such resolution will be final and conclusive except in a
case where the interests of the chairman have not been fairly disclosed.(2)

31. **OFFICERS**

 



 

31.1 The Officers of the Company, who may or may not be Directors, may be
appointed by the Board at any time, subject to Bye-Law 30.14. Any person
appointed pursuant to this Bye-Law shall hold office for such period and upon
such terms as the Board may determine and the Board may revoke or terminate
any such appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without
prejudice to any claim for damages that such Officer may have against the
Company or the Company may have against such Officer for any breach of any
contract of

(otherwise we suggest that it remain).

 



       
 

 



 

service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation
or termination. Save as provided in the Companies Acts or these Bye-Laws, the
powers and duties of the Officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are
determined from time to time by the Board.

 



 

31.2 The emoluments of any Director holding executive office for his services
as such shall be determined by the Board, and may be of any description, and
(without limiting the generality of the foregoing) may include admission to or
continuance of membership of any scheme (including any share acquisition
scheme) or fund instituted or established or financed or contributed to by the
Company for the provision of pensions, life assurance or other benefits for
employees or their dependants, or the payment of a pension or other benefits
to him or his dependants on or after retirement or death, apart from
membership or any such scheme or fund.

 



 

31.3 Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of these Bye-Laws as to the

apply to the resignation and disqualification of Officers.(3)

33. **SECRETARY AND RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

33.1 The Secretary (including one or more deputy or assistant secretaries)

at such remuneration (if any) and upon such terms as it may think fit and any
Secretary and Resident Representative so

  (3) _Note to Atlantic_ : Please provide rationale for deleting this provision
(otherwise we suggest that it remain).

 



      
 

 



 

appointed may be removed by the Board. The duties of the Secretary and the
duties of the Resident Representative shall be those prescribed by the
Companies Acts together with such other duties as shall from time to time be
prescribed by the Board.

 



 

33.2 A provision of the Companies Acts or these Bye-Laws requiring or
authorising a thing to be done by or to a Director and the Secretary shall not
be satisfied by its being done by or to the same person acting both as
Director and as, or in the place of, the Secretary.

 



 

 **THE SEAL**

 



 

34. **THE SEAL**

 



 

34.1 The Board may authorise the production of a common seal of the Company
and one or more duplicate common seals of the Company, which shall consist of
a circular device with the name of the Company around the outer margin thereof
and the country and year of registration in Bermuda across the centre thereof.

 



 

34.2 Any document required to be under seal or executed as a deed on behalf of
the Company may be

 



 

34.2.1 executed under the Seal in accordance with these Bye-Laws; or

 



 

34.2.2 signed or executed by any person authorised by the Board for that
purpose, without the use of the Seal.

 



 

34.3 The Board shall provide for the custody of every Seal. A Seal shall only
be used by authority of the Board or of a committee constituted by the Board.
Subject to these Bye-Laws, any instrument to which a Seal is affixed shall be
attested by the signature of:

 



 

34.3.1 a Director; or

 



 

34.3.2 the Secretary; or

 



 

34.3.3 any one person authorised by the Board for that purpose.

 



 

 **DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PAYMENTS**

 



 

35. **DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PAYMENTS**

 



 

35.1 The Board may from time to time declare dividends or distributions out of
contributed surplus to be paid to the Shareholders according to their rights
and interests, including such interim dividends as appear to the Board to be
justified by the position of the Company. The Board, in its discretion, may
determine that any dividend shall be paid in cash or shall be satisfied,
subject to Bye-Law 37, in paying up in full shares in the Company to be issued
to the Shareholders credited as fully paid or partly paid or partly in one way
and partly the other. The Board may also pay any fixed cash dividend which is
payable on any shares of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company quarterly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the
Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies such payment.

 



 

35.2 Except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any
share otherwise provide:

 



 

35.2.1 all dividends or distributions out of contributed surplus may be
declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of
which the dividend or distribution is paid, and an amount paid up on a share
in advance of calls may be treated for the purpose of this Bye-Law as paid-up
on the share;

 



 

35.2.2 dividends or distributions out of contributed surplus may be
apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the shares
during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend
or distribution is paid.

 



 

35.3 The Board may deduct from any dividend, distribution or other monies
payable to a Shareholder by the Company on or in respect of any shares all
sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of
calls or otherwise in respect of shares of the Company.

 



 

35.4 No dividend, distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in
respect of any share shall bear interest against the Company.

 



 

35.5 Any dividend, distribution or interest, or part thereof payable in cash,
or any other sum payable in cash to the holder of shares may be paid by cheque
or warrant sent through the post or by courier addressed to the holder at his
address in the Register or, in the case of joint holders, addressed to the
holder whose name stands first in the Register in respect of the shares at his
registered address as appearing in the Register or addressed to such person at
such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such
cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders otherwise direct,
be made payable to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders,
to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register in respect
of such shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the
cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good
discharge to the Company. Any one of two (2) or more joint holders may give
effectual receipts for any dividends, distributions or other monies payable or
property distributable in respect of the shares held by such joint holders.

 



 

35.6 Any dividend or distribution out of contributed surplus unclaimed for a
period of six (6) years from the date of declaration of such dividend or
distribution shall be forfeited and shall revert to the Company and the
payment by the Board of any unclaimed dividend, distribution, interest or
other sum payable on or in respect of the share into a separate account shall
not constitute the Company a trustee in respect thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

35.7 The Board may also, in addition to its other powers, direct payment or
satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of contributed surplus wholly
or in part by the distribution of specific assets, and in particular of paid-
up shares or debentures of any other company, and where any difficulty arises
in regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board may settle it as it
thinks expedient, and in particular, may authorise any person to sell and
transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions altogether, and may fix the
value for distribution or dividend purposes of any such specific assets and
may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Shareholders upon the
footing of the values so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution and
may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the
Board, provided that such dividend or distribution may not be satisfied by the
distribution of any partly paid shares or debentures of any company without
the sanction of a Resolution.

 



 

36. **RESERVES**

 



 

The Board may, before declaring any dividend or distribution out of
contributed surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper as reserves which
shall, at the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose of the
Company and pending such application may, also at such discretion, either be
employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as
the Board may from time to time think fit. The Board may also without placing
the same to reserve carry forward any sums which it may think it prudent not
to distribute.

 



 

 **CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS**

 



 

37. **CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS**

 



 

37.1 The Board may from time to time resolve to capitalise all or any part of
any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any reserve or fund
which is available for distribution or to the credit of any share premium
account and accordingly that such amount be set free for distribution amongst
the Shareholders or any class of Shareholders who would be entitled thereto if
distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions, on the footing
that the same be not paid in cash but be applied either in or towards paying
up amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares in the Company held by such
Shareholders respectively or in payment up in full of unissued shares,
debentures or other obligations of the Company, to be allotted and distributed
credited as fully paid amongst such Shareholders, or partly in one way and
partly in the other, provided that for the purpose of this Bye-Law, a share
premium account may be applied only in paying up of unissued shares to be
issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid.

 



      
 

 



 

37.2 Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under this Bye-
Law, the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient and, in particular,
may authorise any person to sell and transfer any fractions or may resolve
that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct
proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may
determine that cash payments should be made to any Shareholders in order to
adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Board. The
Board may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to
participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving
effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the
Shareholders.

 



 

 **RECORD DATE**

 



 

38. **RECORD DATE**

 



 

38.1 In order that the Company may determine the Shareholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment
thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of shares, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, a majority of the members of the Board may fix, in advance, a
record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten
(10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior
to any other action (the **record date** ). A determination of Shareholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
majority of the members of the Board may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

 



 

38.2 If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining Shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be at the
close of business on the day before the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day before the day on which
the meeting is held. The record date for determining Shareholders for any
other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which a majority
of the members of the Board adopts the resolution relating to such purpose.

 



 

38.3 As regards any shares, or shares of the relevant class, which are
registered in the name of a shareholder at the record date ( **record date
holder** ) but are not so registered at the meeting date ( **relevant shares**
), each holder of any relevant shares at the meeting date shall be deemed to
have irrevocably appointed that record date holder as his proxy for the
purpose of attending and voting in respect of those relevant shares at the
relevant meeting (with power to appoint, or to authorise the appointment of,
some other person as proxy), in such manner as the record date holder in his
absolute discretion may determine.

 



 

38.4 Accordingly, except through his proxy pursuant to Bye-Law 38.3 above, a
holder of relevant shares at the meeting date shall not be entitled to attend
or to vote at the relevant meeting, or to exercise any of the rights or
privileges of a Shareholder, or a Shareholder of the relevant class, in
respect of the relevant shares at that meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ACCOUNTING RECORDS**

 



 

39. **ACCOUNTING RECORDS**

 



 

39.1 The Board shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a
true and fair view of the state of the Companys affairs and to show and
explain its transactions, in accordance with the Companies Acts.

 



 

39.2 The records of account shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such
other place or places as the Board thinks fit, and shall at all times be open
to inspection by the Directors, PROVIDED that if the records of account are
kept at some place outside Bermuda, there shall be kept at an office of the
Company in Bermuda such records as will enable the Directors to ascertain with
reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company at the end of each
three (3) month period. No Shareholder (other than an Officer of the Company)
shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of
the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Board.

 



 

39.3 A copy of every balance sheet and statement of income and expenditure,
including every document required by law to be annexed thereto, which is to be
laid before the Company in general meeting, together with a copy of the
auditors report, shall be sent to each person entitled thereto in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Acts.

 



 

 **AUDIT**

 



 

40. **AUDIT**

 



 

Save and to the extent that an audit is waived in the manner permitted by the
Companies Acts, auditors shall be appointed and their duties regulated in
accordance with the Companies Acts, any other applicable law and such
requirements not inconsistent with the Companies Acts as the Board may from
time to time determine.

 



 

 **SERVICE OF NOTICES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS**

 



 

41. **SERVICE OF NOTICES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS**

 



 

41.1 Any notice or other document (including but not limited to a share
certificate, any notice of a general meeting of the Company, any instrument of
proxy and any document to be sent in accordance with Bye-Law 39.3) may be sent
to, served on or delivered to any Shareholder by the Company

 



 

41.1.1 personally;

 



 

41.1.2 by sending it through the post (by airmail where applicable) in a pre-
paid letter addressed to such Shareholder at his address as appearing in the
Register;

 



      
 

 



 

41.1.3 by sending it by courier to or leaving it at the Shareholders address
appearing in the Register;

 



 

41.1.4 where applicable, by sending it by email or facsimile or other mode of
representing or reproducing words in a legible and non-transitory form or by
sending an electronic record of it by electronic means, in each case to an
address or number supplied by such Shareholder for the purposes of
communication in such manner; or

 



 

41.1.5 by publication of an electronic record of it on a website and
notification of such publication (which shall include the address of the
website, the place on the website where the document may be found, and how the
document may be accessed on the website) by any of the methods set out in
paragraphs 41.1.1, 41.1.2, 41.1.3 or 41.1.4 of this Bye-Law, in accordance
with the Companies Acts.

 



 

In the case of joint holders of a share, service or delivery of any notice or
other document on or to one of the joint holders shall for all purposes be
deemed as sufficient service on or delivery to all the joint holders.

 



 

41.2 Any notice or other document shall be deemed to have been served on or
delivered to any Shareholder by the Company

 



 

41.2.1 if sent by personal delivery, at the time of delivery;

41.2.3 if sent by courier or facsimile, twenty-four (24) hours after sending;

 



 

41.2.4 if sent by email or other mode of representing or reproducing words in
a legible and non-transitory form or as an electronic record by electronic
means, twelve (12) hours after sending; or

 



 

41.2.5 if published as an electronic record on a website, at the time that the
notification of such publication shall be deemed to have been delivered to
such Shareholder,

 



 

and in proving such service or delivery, it shall be sufficient to prove that
the notice or document was properly addressed and stamped and put in the post,
published on a website in accordance with the Companies Acts and the
provisions of these Bye-Laws, or sent by courier, facsimile, email or as an
electronic record by electronic means, as the case may be, in accordance with
these Bye-Laws.

 



 

Each Shareholder and each person becoming a Shareholder subsequent to the
adoption of these Bye-Laws, by virtue of its holding or its acquisition and
continued holding of a share, as applicable, shall be deemed to have
acknowledged and agreed that any notice or other

 



      
 

 



 

document (excluding a share certificate) may be provided by the Company by way
of accessing them on a website instead of being provided by other means.

 



 

41.3 If any time, by reason of the suspension or curtailment of postal
services within Bermuda or any other territory, the Company is unable
effectively to convene a general meeting by notices sent through the post, a
general meeting may be convened by a notice advertised in at least one
national newspaper published in the territory concerned and such notice shall
be deemed to have been duly served on each person entitled to receive it in
that territory on the day, or on the first day, on which the advertisement
appears. In any such case the Company shall send confirmatory copies of the
notice by post if at least five (5) clear days before the meeting the posting
of notices to addresses throughout that territory again becomes practicable.

 



 

41.4 Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of these Bye-Laws as to
service of notices and other documents on Shareholders shall mutatis mutandis
apply to service or delivery of notices and other documents to the Company or
any Director, Alternate Director or Resident Representative pursuant to these
Bye-Laws.

 



 

 **WINDING UP**

 



 

42. **WINDING UP**

 



 

If the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a
Resolution of the Company and any other sanction required by the Companies
Acts, divide amongst the Shareholders in specie or kind the whole or any part
of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the
same kind or not) and may for such purposes set such values as he deems fair
upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such
division shall be carried out as between the Shareholders or different classes
of Shareholders. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or
any part of such assets in trustees upon such trust for the benefit of the
contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but
so that no Shareholder shall be compelled to accept any shares or other assets
upon which there is any liability.

 



 

 **INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE**

 



 

43. **INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE**

 



 

43.1 Subject to the proviso below, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified and held
harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss,
damage or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract,
tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all
reasonable legal and other costs and expenses properly payable) incurred or
suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in
the conduct of the Companys business or in the discharge of his duties and
the indemnity contained in this Bye-Law shall extend to any Indemnified Person
acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been
appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in
such appointment or

 



      
 

 



 

election PROVIDED ALWAYS that the indemnity contained in this Bye-Law shall
not extend to any matter which would render it void pursuant to the Companies
Acts.

 



 

43.2 No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for the acts,
defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person.

 



 

43.3 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, every Indemnified
Person shall be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all
liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or
omitted in the conduct of the Companys business or in the discharge of his
duties, in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, if any such
Indemnified Person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
unlawful and such expenses and liabilities are not found by a court of
competent jurisdiction upon entry of a final non-appealable judgment to be the
result of any such Indemnified Persons fraud and dishonesty.

 



 

43.4 To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an
indemnity pursuant to these Bye-Laws in respect of amounts paid or discharged
by him, the relevant indemnity shall take effect as an obligation of the
Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such
discharge.

 



 

43.5 Each Shareholder and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of
action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the
right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any action
taken by such Indemnified Person or the failure of such Indemnified Person to
take any action in the performance of his duties with or for the Company
PROVIDED HOWEVER that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of
action arising out of the fraud of such Indemnified Person or to recover any
gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not
legally entitled.

 



 

43.6 The Company shall advance all expenses incurred by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person in connection with any proceedings within ten (10) days
after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from such
Indemnified Person requesting such advance or advances from time to time,
whether prior to or after final disposition of such proceedings. Such
statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Person and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by an
undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay any expenses
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a final, non-appealable order
of the Supreme Court of Bermuda or other court of competent jurisdiction that
the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified against such
expenses. Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this Bye-Law 43.6
shall be unsecured and interest free and made without regard to any
Indemnified Persons financial ability to repay such expenses.

 



 

43.7 Without prejudice to the provisions of this Bye-Law, the Board shall have
the power to purchase and maintain insurance for or for the benefit of any
Indemnified Person or any persons who are or were at any time Directors,
Officers, employees of the Company, or of any

 



      
 

 



 

other company which is its holding company or in which the Company or such
holding company has any interest whether direct or indirect or which is in any
way allied to or associated with the Company, or of any subsidiary undertaking
of the Company or any such other company, or who are or were at any time
trustees of any pension fund in which employees of the Company or any such
other company or subsidiary undertaking are interested, including (without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) insurance against any liability
incurred by such persons in respect of any act or omission in the actual or
purported execution or discharge of their duties or in the exercise or
purported exercise of their powers or otherwise in relation to their duties,
powers or offices in relation to the Company or any such other company,
subsidiary undertaking or pension fund.

 



 

 **AMALGAMATION OR MERGER**

 



 

44. **AMALGAMATION OR MERGER**

 



 

Any resolution proposed for consideration at any general meeting to approve
the amalgamation or merger of the Company with any other company, wherever
incorporated, shall require the approval of:

 



 

44.1 the Board, by resolution adopted by a majority of Directors then in
office, and

 



 

44.2 the Shareholders, by resolution passed by a majority of votes cast at
such meeting and the quorum for such meeting shall be that required in Bye-Law
20.1.

outstanding Common Shares, unless the failure so to increase such annual rate
is approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; and

 



 

(iv) such Interested Shareholders shall not have become the beneficial owner
of any additional Capital Shares except as part of the transaction that
results in such Interested Shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder and
except in a transaction that, after giving effect thereto, would not result in

of any other class or series of Capital Shares retained by the holders of such
shares.

 



 

47.5 A majority of the Continuing Directors shall have power and duty to

47.6 Nothing contained in this Bye-Law shall be construed to relieve any
Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.

Combination or recommend its adoption or approval to the Shareholders of the
Company, nor shall such compliance limit, prohibit or otherwise restrict in
any manner the Board or any member thereof, with respect to evaluations of or
actions and responses taken with respect to such Business Combination.

 



 

47.8 A Proposed Action is presumed to have been proposed by, or on behalf of,
an Interested Shareholder or a person who thereafter would become such if

Interested Shareholder, would not qualify to serve as a Continuing Director or

percent [(66 2/3%)] vote shall not be required for, any amendment, repeal or
adoption unanimously recommended by the Board if all of the Directors on the
Board are persons who would be eligible to serve as Continuing Directors
within the meaning of Bye-Law 47.1.8.
