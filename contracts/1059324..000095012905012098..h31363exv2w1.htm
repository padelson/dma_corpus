STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of December 14, 2005, by and among Winwell Resources, Inc., a Louisiana corporation ("WRI"), the Shareholders of WRI entering into this Agreement (collectively, "Sellers" and individually a "Seller"), and Petrohawk Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"). 

  

RECITALS: 

   

 WHEREAS, Sellers own, in the aggregate, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, no par value per share (the "Shares"), of WRI; 

  

 WHEREAS, WRI owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of WSF, Inc., a Louisiana corporation ("WSF"); 

  

 WHEREAS, each Seller desires to sell the Shares held by such Seller to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase the same, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined shall have the meaning given such terms in _Article XII_; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the legal sufficiency of which is herby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 PURCHASE AND SALE 

   

 1.1 _Agreement to Sell and to Purchase_. 

  

 (a) On the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, each Seller shall transfer, sell, assign and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from each Seller, the Shares held by such Seller, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances. 

   

 (b) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of such sale and purchase ("Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wiener, Weiss and Madison, A Professional Corporation, 333 Texas Street, Suite 2350, Shreveport, Louisiana, on January 6, 2006; _provided, however,_ that Buyer shall have the right to extend (one or more times) the date for Closing to a date not later than February 10, 2006, by giving Sellers written notice at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date then scheduled for Closing. Title to, ownership of and control over the Shares shall pass to Buyer at Closing. At the Closing Sellers and Buyer shall deliver the items set forth in _Section 7.2 _and _Section 8.2_, respectively. Wiener, Weiss and Madison, A Professional Corporation, shall serve as closing agent under this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 1.2 _Purchase Price and Deposit_. 

  

 (a) In consideration of the transfer to Buyer of the Shares, and in accordance with this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Sellers ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($175,000,000.00), in the aggregate (the "Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation _Section 1.3_,  _Section 1.4_ and  _Section 1.5_ hereof. 

   

 (b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall make a deposit with AmSouth Bank ("Escrow Agent") in the amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000), to be held by Escrow Agent as the "Deposit" pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The Deposit shall be considered earnest money (as that term is defined in La. Civ. Code art. 2624), but as more specifically set forth hereinbelow. All fees payable to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne and paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. 

   

 (c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, then the Deposit and any interest earned thereon shall be distributed to Sellers and shall be considered as payment of a portion of the Purchase Price, and the Purchase Price payable by Buyer at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the Deposit and any interest earned thereon. 

   

 (d) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in _Article VII_ have been met and neither Sellers nor WRI are in material breach of any provisions of this Agreement; and (ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated solely because the conditions to Sellers obligation to close set forth in _Section 8.1_ and  _Section 8.2_ of this Agreement are not satisfied as of the Closing Date; then the Sellers shall have the option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_ and be paid the Deposit and any interest earned thereon as liquidated damages as their sole and exclusive remedy; and such payment to Sellers (i) shall be paid to Sellers in accordance with the _pro rata_  portion of the Purchase Price that would have been payable to each Seller, and (ii) shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages Sellers may have as a result of the transactions not being consummated in accordance with this Agreement. WRI, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to accomplish the foregoing. 

   

 (e) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Sellers set forth in _Article VIII_ have been met and Buyer is not in material breach of any provisions of this Agreement; and (ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated solely because the conditions to Buyers obligation to close set forth in _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ of this Agreement are not satisfied as of the Closing Date and Sellers have willfully and materially breached their covenants and agreements hereunder; then Buyer shall have the option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)_ and as its sole remedy have the Deposit any interest earned thereon returned to Buyer, plus have WRI pay (and WRI and Sellers shall be shall be obligated _in solido_ to pay) to Buyer an additional amount equal to the Deposit; and such remedy shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages Buyer may have as a result of the transactions not being consummated in accordance with this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) If this Agreement is terminated under any circumstance other than as described in  _Section 1.2(d)_ or _Section 1.2(e)_, then Buyer shall be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit and any interest earned thereon, free of any claims by Sellers with respect thereto. In such event, WRI, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to accomplish the foregoing. Buyer, WRI and Sellers shall thereupon have the rights and obligations set forth in _Section 11.2_. 

   

 (g) At Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Agent in cash in immediately available funds by wire transfer (a) the Purchase Price, adjusted as set forth in _Section 1.3 and Section 1.4_, less the Deposit (and any interest earned thereon) and less the Warranties Escrow, the Title/Environmental Escrow and the WC Adjustment Escrow, to be disbursed at Closing to the Sellers as shall be directed in writing by WRI on behalf of Sellers, (b) the Warranties Escrow for the Escrow Agent to hold pursuant to this Agreement and the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement, (c) the WC Adjustment Escrow for the Escrow Agent to hold pursuant to this Agreement and the WC Adjustment Escrow Agreement, and (d) the Title/Environmental Escrow for the Escrow Agent to hold pursuant to this Agreement and the Title/Environmental Escrow Agreement. 

   

 1.3 _Agreed Adjustments to Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: 

  

 (a) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted _upward_ by the following: 

   

 (i) to the extent not otherwise incorporated into the calculation of Net Working Capital, the value of all Hydrocarbons in storage or in transit owned by WRI above the pipeline connection at 7:00 a.m. Central Standard Time on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time"), and not previously sold by WRI or any of its Subsidiaries, that is credited to WRI, such value to be the contract price, or if no contract is in effect, the actual sales price, less severance and production taxes or gravity adjustments deducted by the purchaser of such oil or other liquids; 

  

 (ii) the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, if a positive figure; 

  

 (iii) the Final Adjusted Tax Liability, if a negative figure ( _e.g._ , a refund for overpaid taxes), provided, however, that in the case of a refund attributable to a net operating loss, the Purchase Price will only be adjusted upward to the extent that the net operating loss is eligible to be carried back and applied against WRIs prior years net income and will result in tax refunds for such prior years; and 

  

 (iv) any other amount agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers. 

  

 (b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted _downward_ by the following: 

   

 (i) the total amount of Outstanding Indebtedness, if any; 

  

 (ii) the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, if a negative figure; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) the Final Adjusted Tax Liability, if a positive figure; 

  

 (iv) all change of control, bonus payments or other similar payments that will be due and payable within 10 Business Days of the Closing and that are not paid at or prior to the Closing by WRI under the Incentive Payment Agreements (including, without limitation, the employer share of any employment related Taxes with respect to such payments), to the extent not accrued or included in the Net Working Capital calculated as of the Effective Time; 

  

 (v) all out-of-pocket expenditures incurred by WRI (including legal fees and brokers fees) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent not accrued or included in the Net Working Capital or otherwise paid at or prior to the Closing by WRI; 

  

 (vi) any adjustment agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, or determined by the Consultant, pursuant to _Section 7.1_; 

  

 (vii) any adjustments agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, or determined by the Title/Environmental Expert, pursuant to _Section 2.5_; 

  

 (viii) any amount paid to Buyers by the Escrow Agent out of the Title/Environmental Escrow pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ to the extent not already accounted for pursuant to item (vii) above; and 

  

 (ix) any other amounts agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers. 

  

 1.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price at Closing_. On or before five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, WRI, on behalf of Sellers, will prepare and deliver to Buyer, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and AMA-T, a proposed statement (the "Closing Adjustments Statement") setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price required under this Agreement and showing the calculation of adjustments, as estimated in good faith by Sellers, required pursuant to  _Section 1.3_, including an estimate of the Final Adjusted Tax Liability. In preparing the Closing Adjustments Statement, WRI shall communicate with Buyer and provide underlying data to Buyer relating to the Closing Adjustments Statement. Within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Closing Adjustments Statement, Buyer will deliver to Sellers a written report containing any proposed changes, together with an explanation of each change that Buyer proposes to be made to the Closing Adjustments Statement. The Closing Adjustments Statement, as mutually agreed upon by the parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing, provided if no agreement can be reached, Sellers adjusted Closing Adjustments Statement shall be used for Closing, subject to further adjustment as provided in paragraph 1.5 below. 

  

1.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price; Final Settlement_. 

   

 (a) _Determination of Adjustment_. Except with respect to adjustments to the Purchase Price for indemnification payments pursuant to _Article IX_, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers, in accordance with this Agreement and AMA-T, a proposed statement (the "Final Adjustments Statement") setting 

    ##### 

  

    

forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price required under this Agreement
[including the Tax Adjustment Amount determined pursuant to _Section
6.10(c)(ii)_] and showing the calculation of such adjustments and the
resulting final Purchase Price (as set forth in the Final Adjustments
Statement or otherwise determined pursuant to this _Section 1.5_, the "Final
Price"). The Final Adjustments Statement shall include an adjustment for the
value any accounts receivable shown on the Closing Adjustments Statement that
have not been collected as of the date of the Final Adjustments Statement;
provided, however, that such uncollected accounts receivable shall then
be assigned to Sellers. As soon as practicable, and in any event within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the preliminary Final Adjustments
Statement, Sellers shall return a written report containing any proposed
changes to the preliminary Final Adjustments Statement and an explanation of
any such changes and the reasons therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). If the Final
Price set forth in the Final Adjustments Statement is mutually agreed upon by
Sellers and Buyer, the Final Adjustments Statement and the Final Price, as
mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto. Failure of the Sellers to timely respond in writing to the
Final Adjustments Statement shall be deemed to constitute Sellers agreement
to such statement and the Final Price. 

   

 (b) _Disputes_. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Sellers shall within three (3) Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty-five pages or less and submit such summaries to the Shreveport, Louisiana office of KPMG, or such other party as the parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Adjustments Statement and any other documentation such party may desire to submit. Within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving the parties respective submissions but in no event later than three (3) days prior to the Final Settlement Date (defined below), the Accounting Arbitrator shall render in writing a decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position or a position in between those (but in no event higher or lower than the amounts proposed in the Final Adjustments Statement or the Dispute Notice) with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials described above and based upon the books and records of the Purchased Companies, and the Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to with such decision the calculation of the Final Price based on such decision. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. 

   

 (c) _Payment of Final Settlement_. Any difference in the Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Closing Adjustments Statement and the Final Price as determined pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) above shall be paid (the "Final Payment"): (i) if by Sellers, as an indemnification made out of the WC Adjustment Escrow pursuant to, and as limited by, _Section 1.5(d)_ ; and (ii) if by Buyer, one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date or the next Business Day if such date is not a Business Day (the "Final Settlement Date") by wire transfer or other immediately available funds to Escrow Agent, with such payments to be disbursed by Escrow Agent in accordance with the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Working Capital Escrow_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, should the transactions contemplated in this Agreement close (i) Sellers shall have no, and Buyer hereby waives and releases any, obligation or liability under this _Section 1.5_ with respect to the Final Payment in excess of the WC Adjustment Escrow, and (ii) the WC Adjustment Escrow shall be the sole source of funds available to Buyer from Sellers in connection with the Final Payment.

 (a) From and after the date hereof and up to and including the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement) but subject to the other provisions of this _Section 2.1_ and obtaining any required consents of Third-Parties, including Third-Party operators of the Core Assets (with respect to which consents Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Sellers shall afford to Buyer and its officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and other authorized representatives ("Buyers Representatives") full access during normal business hours to the Core Assets and all Records and other documents in the possession of the Purchased Companies relating to the Purchased Companies and their businesses. Sellers shall also make available to Buyer and Buyers Representatives, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, the Purchased Companies officers and employees having personal knowledgeable with respect to the assets and operations of the Purchased Companies in order that Buyer may make such diligence investigation as Buyer considers necessary or appropriate. All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall result from Buyers own independent review and judgment. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property assessment with respect to the Core Assets that satisfies the basic assessment requirements set forth under the current American Society for Testing and Material Standard Practice for Phase I environmental property assessments (Designation E1527-00) but, except as set forth below in this _Section 2.1(b)_ , such Phase I environmental property assessment shall not include on-site testing of any non-scope issues as such issues are described in Article 12 of such Standard Practice.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any environmental due diligence (including any Phase I environmental property assessments) with respect to any Core Assets where the Purchased Companies do not have the authority to grant access for such due diligence ( _provided, however_ , the Purchased Companies shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission from any Third Party to allow Buyer and Buyers Representatives such access). In the event that Buyers Phase I environmental property assessments identify actual or potential "recognized environmental concerns," then Buyer may request Sellers consent to conduct additional Phase II environmental property assessments, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The 

    ##### 

  

    

additional Phase II environmental property assessment procedures relating to
any additional investigation shall be submitted to WRI in a Phase II
environmental property assessment plan, and shall be reasonable based on the
recognized environmental concerns identified by the Phase I assessment.
Thereafter, WRI may, in its sole discretion, approve said Phase II
environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part, and Buyer shall
not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan until
such time that WRI has approved such plan in writing, provided, however, if
such plan is not approved, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and
such termination shall be considered a termination by mutual consent under
_Section 11.1(a)_ of this Agreement. Any such approved Phase II
environmental property assessment plan shall be performed in accordance with
this _Section 2.1_ and in compliance with all Laws. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall coordinate its environmental property assessments and physical inspections of the Core Assets to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by the Purchased Companies, the other operators and co-owners of the Core Assets, and surface owners.

Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold each of Seller Group, the Purchased Companies and the surface owners, operators and working interest owners of the Core Assets, and their owners, officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and representatives, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental property assessment, or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyers Representative with respect to the Core Assets, even if such Losses arise out of or result from the sole, active, passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of Law of or by a member of Seller Group, excepting only Losses actually resulting on the account of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a member of Seller Group. 

   

 (d) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Sellers and WRI, but in no less than five (5) days after receipt or creation, copies of all final reports and test results, prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyers Representatives and which contain data collected or generated from Buyers due diligence with respect to the Core Assets. Sellers shall not be deemed by their receipt of said documents or otherwise to have made representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Core Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein. 

   

 (e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Sellers or their Affiliates (i) close all bore holes from its environmental property assessment and any approved work with respect to a Phase II environmental property assessment in accordance with recognized industry standards, (ii) repair all damage done to the Core Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence, (iii) restore the Core Assets to the approximate same or better condition than it was prior to commencement of Buyers due diligence, and (iv) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Core Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence.

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) During all periods that Buyer, and/or any of Buyers Representatives are on the Core Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with its current insurers policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts that exist under Buyers current policies Upon request by WRI, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to WRI prior to entering upon the Core Assets.

Buyer acknowledges that such activities may have produced conditions regarded as environmentally adverse. In addition, some production equipment may contain asbestos or naturally occurring radioactive material (hereinafter referred to as "NORM"). In this regard, Buyer expressly understands and agrees that NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale or in other forms, and that said wells, materials and equipment located on the properties may contain NORM and that NORM-containing material may be buried or otherwise disposed of on the properties. Further, Buyer acknowledges that, as a result of the historic operations of these Core Assets, NORM may be present in air, water or soil on or near the sites and that Sellers may be unaware of the presence of some or all of such NORM. Effective upon the Closing, Buyer hereby releases, and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, each member of the Seller Group from any liability with respect to any adverse environmental condition related to or arising out of the ownership or operation at any time of the Core Assets, including, without limitation, any and all Environmental Defects and Environmental Claims. Buyer agrees that after the Closing it shall cause the Purchased Companies to store, transport, dispose of, discharge, remediate and otherwise handle all waste (including but not limited to produced water, crude oil, drilling fluids, NORM, solvents, asbestos and other waste) generated in connection with the ownership or operation of the Core Assets in accordance with all applicable Laws. 

  

 2.3 _Acknowledgment of Responsibility_  

   

 (a) Buyer acknowledges the Purchased Companies responsibilities following Closing, and hereby agrees, following Closing, to cause the Purchased Companies to plug and abandon each and every well included in the Core Assets for which any or all of the Purchased Companies has such responsibility and to reclaim and remediate the Core Assets for which any Purchased Company has such reclamation and/or remediation obligation in accordance with applicable Laws and as may be required under any Lease, contract or other agreement affecting the Core Assets (whether or not the plugging or reclamation obligation arose or relates to periods of time prior to or after the Effective Time). 

   

 (b) Except to the extent (and only to the extent) that Sellers are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Group pursuant to _Section 6.10_ and/or _Section 9.2_, Buyer expressly acknowledges that the Purchased Companies are responsible, and none of the Purchased 

     ##### 

  

    

Companies, Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall have recourse against
any member of the Seller Group, for the debts, liabilities, commitments,
duties and obligations of the Purchased Companies, including those arising
under, related to, or in connection with the ownership, operation or use
of the Core Assets or the business of WRI or its Subsidiaries and whether or
not such debts, liabilities, commitments, duties or obligations arise or
relate to periods of time prior to or after the Effective Time. 

   

 2.4 _Disclaimers_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement, none of Sellers or any Affiliate of a Seller makes any representation or warranty, express, statutory, implied or otherwise with respect to the Core Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement, each Seller, for itself and its/his Affiliates, hereby expressly disclaims any and all representations and warranties associated with the Core Assets, the Purchased Companies and the Shares, express, statutory, implied or otherwise, including any representation or warranty regarding: (a) title, (b) any costs, expenses, revenues, receipts, accounts receivable, or accounts payable, (c) any contractual, economic or financial information and data associated with the Core Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (d) the continued financial viability or productivity of the Core Assets or transportability of product, (e) the environmental or physical condition of the Core Assets, (f) any federal, state, local or tribal income or other Tax consequences associated with the Core Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (g) the absence of redhibitory, patent or latent defects, (h) the state of repair of the Core Assets, (i) merchantability or conformity to models, (j) fitness for a particular purpose, and (k) production rates, recompletion opportunities, drilling opportunities and locations, decline rates or the quality, quantity or volume of the reserves of hydrocarbons, if any, attributable to the Core Assets. Each Seller, for itself and its/his Affiliates, expressly disclaims any and all representations and warranties, except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ associated with the quality, accuracy, completeness or materiality of the information, data and materials furnished (whether electronically, orally, by video, in writing or any other medium, by compact disk, at the offices of the Purchased Companies, in any data room or otherwise) at any time to Buyer Group associated with transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, information, data or materials regarding: (a) title to the Core Assets, (b) costs, expenses, revenues, receipts, accounts receivable or accounts payable associated with the Core Assets, (c) contractual, economic or financial information associated with the Core Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (d) the continued financial viability or productivity of the Core Assets, or transportability of product, (e) the environmental or physical condition of the Core Assets, (f) federal, state, local or tribal income or other Tax consequences associated with the Core Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (g) the absence of redhibitory, patent or latent defects, (h) the state of repair of the Core Assets, (i) any warranty regarding merchantability or conformity to models, (j) any rights of any member of Buyer Group under appropriate Laws to claim diminution of consideration or return of the purchase price, (k) any warranty of freedom from patent, copyright or trademark infringement, (l) warranties existing under applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, (m) any warranty regarding fitness for a particular purpose, and (n) production rates, recompletion opportunities, decline rates, gas balancing information or 

   #####

attributable to the Core Assets. 

   

 2.5 _Title and Environmental Matters_. (a) After the execution hereof, Buyer shall have the right to conduct such title examination of the Core Assets as Buyer deems necessary or appropriate. If Buyer determines in good faith that any Title Defect and/or Environmental Defect exists, then Buyer may give Sellers written notice on or prior to the Defect Notice Date of any claimed Title Defect and/or Environmental Defect (each such Title Defect and Environmental Defect is referred to as a "Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect"). To be effective, each such notice shall set forth (a) a description of the matter constituting the claimed Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect, and (b) the proposed Purchase Price reduction for the cost of curing the Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect in question. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any claimed Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect on or before Closing. The parties shall reduce the Purchase Price to reflect the mutually agreed upon estimated cost of curing all Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defects not cured by Sellers prior to Closing (or if no cure is possible, the mutually agreed upon diminution of the value of the affected Core Assets from the Allocated Value of such Core Assets); _provided, however_ , that if the estimated costs to cure such Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defects and/or diminution in the value in the aggregate exceed the Materiality Threshold, either Buyer or Sellers may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to the other party prior to Closing; further provided, however, that Buyer shall have until Closing to notify Sellers that it waives such amount which exceeds the Materiality Threshold and in such event Sellers will no longer have an option to terminate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defects will be made unless the aggregate adjustments for all Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defects exceed $1,500,000 (the "Title/Environmental Threshold"), but if such Title/Environmental Threshold is met, the adjustment to the Purchase Price for such Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defects shall be from the first dollar of such defects. 

  

 (b) If Sellers and Buyer cannot agree on the existence of a Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect or the adjustment, if any, therefore on or before five (5) days prior to Closing then the dispute will be submitted to a title attorney selected by Sellers and Buyer (such title attorney hereinafter, "Title/Environmental Expert"). The Title/Environmental Expert will have expertise in title matters and/or environmental law, as applicable, in Louisiana and the costs of the Title/Environmental Expert will be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. The Title/Environmental Expert may engage the assistance of an environmental consultant to assist in evaluating any environmental issues; and the cost of such consultant shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. Sellers and Buyer will each present the Title/Environmental Expert a written statement of its position on the defect and/or adjustment in question not later than the third (3rd) day after the dispute has been submitted to the Title/Environmental Expert. By the third (3rd) day following the submission of a matter to a Title/Environmental Expert, the Title/Environmental Expert shall make a determination of the dispute, choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to each Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect, and issuing a final calculation of the purchase price reduction for all such defects; _provided, however_ , that the Title/Environmental Experts Purchase Price reduction shall not be higher than Buyers originally proposed Purchase Price reduction. The decision of 

     ##### 

  

    

the Title/Environmental Expert will be final, conclusive and binding on
Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the parties in any
court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (c) In addition to the procedures set forth in (a) and (b) above, Buyer and Sellers may agree to have any one or more uncured Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect be subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.5(c)_. If such election is made, then the portion of the Purchase Price equal to the value of the Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect (as determined in (a) and (b) above) (the "Title/Environmental Escrow") shall be paid over to the Escrow Agent and shall be subject to the Title/Environmental Escrow Agreement. Such amount shall no longer be considered a Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defect for purposes of the Materiality Threshold and shall be thereafter referred to as a "Post-Closing Defect." Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to cure all Post-Closing Defects as quickly as possible. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts (including, without limitation, promptly giving consents when necessary or desirable and entering into reasonable agreements curing such defects, including, without limitation, commingling agreements customary in the field in question) to assist Sellers in curing such defects. 

   

 The Title/Environmental Escrow Agreement shall provide that on the earlier of (i) the satisfaction of (i) the satisfaction of Post-Closing Defects comprising 50% of the Title/Environmental Escrow, as determined by Buyer in its reasonable discretion, or (ii) the thirtieth (30th) day following the Closing Date (the "Interim Release Date"), Buyer and Sellers shall instruct the Title/Environmental Escrow Agent to release from the escrow such portion of the Title/Environmental Escrow that is attributable to Post-Closing Defects that have been cured. Sellers shall have until 150 days from Closing (the "Final Release Date") to attempt to cure all Post-Closing Defects. The value of any remaining Post Closing Defects (and a determination of the amount of the Title/Environmental Escrow to be released to each of Sellers and Buyer) shall be resolved by using the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 for valuing Pre-Closing Title/Environmental Defects. Such amounts shall be paid to Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, promptly after the Final Release Date. Interest earned on the principal amount of the Post-Title/Environmental Escrow shall be distributed to the party that receives the principal upon which the interest is earned. The Escrow Agents fees under the Title/Environmental Escrow Agreement shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. 

  

 (d) The Purchase Price adjustment mechanism set forth in this _Section 2.5_ shall be the exclusive remedy for Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to any Title Defects and/or Environmental Defects, including Post-Closing Defects. Any Title Defect and/or Environmental Defect for which Buyer does not notify Sellers on or prior to the Defect Notice Date shall be deemed and is hereby waived by Buyer on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (including, post-Closing, the Purchased Companies). Nothing contained in this _Section 2.5(d) _shall be construed to be a waiver or release by Buyer or its Affiliates of Buyers remedies for a breach by Sellers of the representations contained in _Section 2.5_.

 6.10 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. The Buyer and the Purchased Companies shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with the Purchased Companies prior Tax Returns (except as otherwise required by law), all Tax Returns that (i) are required to be filed by, or with respect to, the Purchased Companies for Tax periods ending on or before the Effective Time, and for Tax periods that begin before and end after the Effective Time 

    ##### 

  

    

(the "Straddle Period") and (ii) are not filed as of the Effective Time. The
Buyer shall cause the Purchased Companies to timely file each such Tax
Return. Buyer shall cause the Purchased Companies to pay all Taxes due with
respect to the period covered by each such Tax Return. Buyer shall,
upon Sellers written request, promptly provide to Sellers a copy of any or
all tax returns prepared or filed by WRI (and/or any party consolidated with
WRI) and attributable to any portion of the Straddle Period. 

   

 (b) _Liability for Taxes_. Except as provided for in _Section 6.10(c)_, Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of and shall defend, indemnify and hold the Seller Group harmless from and against all Taxes of the Purchased Companies for all periods, whether related to dates and events occurring prior to and/or after the Effective Time, as well as any Losses arising out of, resulting from or attributable to such Taxes. 

   

 (c) _Adjustment to the Purchase Price for Pro Rata Straddle Period Tax Obligations_. 

   

 (i) _Determining Pro Rata Straddle Period Tax Obligations_. Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) above, Buyer shall within ninety (90) days after the Closing prepare and deliver to Sellers _pro forma_ federal and state income tax returns for WRI and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period computed as if the tax year for such Straddle Period ended as of the Effective Time (collectively, the "Straddle Period Returns"). The Straddle Period Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Purchased Companies prior Tax Return (including, without limitation, not treating Buyer as having made an IRC Section 338 election), except as would otherwise have been required by law had the transactions contemplated in this Agreement not closed. In addition, any payments or distributions made to employees of WRI by the Purchased Companies that are classified as "excess parachute payments" as defined in Code Section 280G shall be treated as non-deductible to the Purchased Companies for purposes of the Straddle Period Tax Returns. Sellers shall have fifteen (15) days thereafter to review the Straddle Period Returns and to either agree with such returns or deliver to Buyer written comments suggesting changes to such returns to make the returns a more accurate depiction of such fictitious tax period. Sellers failure to deliver written comments to Buyer within such fifteen (15) day period shall be deemed to be an agreement by Sellers to the Straddle Period Returns as proposed by Buyer. If the Sellers timely deliver written comments to such Straddle Period Returns, then Buyer shall have ten (10) days to review Sellers comments and either agree to such comments or disagree with such comments. If Buyer fails to timely respond to Sellers comments, then Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed to the Straddle Period Tax Returns, as adjusted pursuant to Sellers comments. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree to the Straddle Period Return in the manner set forth above, then each of Buyer and Sellers shall within fifteen (15) days after the running of the ten (10) day response period above summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty-five pages or less and submit such summaries to the Accounting Arbitrator, together with any other documentation such party may desire to submit. Within thirty (30) Business Days after receiving the parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to the outstanding issues regarding the Straddle Period Return, based on the materials described above and based upon the books and records of the Purchased Companies. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against any 

   ##### 

  

 

of the parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees of the
Account Arbitrator shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half
by Buyer. The amount of the tax liability (or overpayment) agreed to as
provided for above (whether by agreement, inaction or the determination of
the Tax Arbitrator) shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Final
Adjusted Tax Liability." 

   

 (ii) _Adjustment in Purchase Price for Straddle Period Tax Obligations_. In order to apportion appropriately among the parties the portion of the federal and state income Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Effective Time, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer (or the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the agreed amount (the "Tax Adjustment Amount") by which the Final Adjusted Tax Liability exceeds (or is less than) the estimated Final Adjusted Tax Liability used for the adjustment in the Purchase Price made at Closing pursuant to _Section 1.4_. The payment by the Sellers to the Buyer (or by the Buyer to the Sellers) under this _Section 6.10(c)(ii)_ shall be effected as part of the adjustment to the Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 1.5_ to determine the Final Price by incorporating the Tax Adjustment Amount into the Final Adjustments Statement. Such adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be Buyers and Sellers sole remedy for the obligations owed pursuant to this _Section 6.10(c)(ii)_. 

  

 (d) The covenants provided in this _Section 6.10_ are in addition to, but not in duplication of, the indemnities provided in _Article IX_. The provisions of _Article IX_ , including the limitations of _Section 9.2(b)_ shall apply to claims for indemnification and breaches of covenants and other payments under this _Section 6.10_;  _provided, however_ , that to the extent any procedural provisions of _Section 9.4_ are inconsistent with the procedural provisions of _Section 6.10_, such provisions of _Section 6.10_ shall apply. 

   

 6.11 _Post-Closing Assistance_. The Sellers who own the company that will employ WRIs employees after the closing and the Sellers who are WRI employees covenant and agree that for a period of sixty (60) days after the Closing, such employees will be allowed to, and shall, provide to Buyer reasonable assistance on an as-needed basis during normal business hours in order to help Buyer transfer management of the Purchased Companies to its control. In particular, such employees shall provide assistance in transferring and converting accounting systems, transferring records and knowledge and expertise of the historical operation of the Core Assets. In addition, whether during or after such sixty (60) day period, if it is determined that final short period federal or state income tax returns are required to be filed by the Purchased Companies, Sellers further agree that such employees will be allowed to and shall assist Buyer in the preparation of such return. Buyer shall pay to the employer of such employees the equivalent of the pro rated salaries such employees are earning during the periods so assisting Buyer. Sellers do not warrant, and Buyer waives any implied warranties, as to the quality of the assistance or opinions provided, except that such assistance and opinions shall be given in good faith. 

  

 In addition, Sellers agree that prior to Closing such employees shall co-operate with and reasonably provide assistance to, Buyer and Buyers accountants during normal business hours, but only to the extent such employees can provide such assistance and still complete the work expected of them by the Purchased Companies. In this regard, Sellers acknowledge that Buyers accountants will be auditing up to three (3) years of WRI financial statements and this process 

   ##### 

  

    

will begin prior to Closing. WRI shall make reasonable efforts to have its
accounting firm assist Buyer at Buyers expense.

The representations and warranties of Sellers contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representations and warranties are qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date, in each case with the same force and effect as though such representations and warranties had been made or given on and as of the Closing Date. Except with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in Article III (all of which shall be true and correct as set forth in the preceding paragraph without limitation) for purposes of the foregoing, it shall not be deemed to be a failure of a representation or warranty of Sellers contained in _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date if (a) such failure, together with all other failures of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in  _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date, would not result in a loss in excess of the Materiality Threshold, or (b) such failure would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 1.3_ of this Agreement (excluding _Section 1.3(b)(vi))_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement but subject to the preceding sentence, in the event that Buyer discovers and/or Sellers or the Purchased Companies disclose at or prior to Closing that any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in _Article III_ or  _IV_ of this Agreement will fail to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date and such failure (together with all other such failures) would not result in a loss in excess of the Materiality Threshold, then Buyer will notify Sellers of Buyers estimate of the loss in value due to such failure. Sellers and Buyer shall use their reasonable efforts to agree upon the amount of any such loss in value and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the agreed upon amount and Buyer and Sellers shall proceed with Closing. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree upon whether there is any failure of a representation or warranty made by Sellers contained in _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date or any adjustment therefor, then Sellers or Buyer shall within two (2) Business Days of the then proposed Closing Date submit the dispute to an attorney selected by Sellers and Buyer who is a Person familiar with mergers and acquisitions law in the State of Louisiana (the "Consultant") and the costs of such Consultant will be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. Sellers and Buyer will each present the Consultant a written statement of its position on the dispute in question not later than 

   ##### 

  

    

one (1) Business Day after the dispute has been submitted to the Consultant.
Within two (2) Business Days following the submission of a matter to the
Consultant, the Consultant shall make a determination of the
dispute, choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to
such dispute. The decision of the Consultant will be final, conclusive and
binding on Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the
parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to _Section 11.1(f)_

submitted to the Consultant for resolution.

 7.4 _No Litigation_. No preliminary or permanent injunction or other order of any Governmental Entity shall be in effect or threatened that prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation before any Governmental Entity shall have been commenced or threatened by any Person (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) seeking to prevent the sale of the Shares or asserting that the sale of all or a portion of the Shares would be unlawful. 

    ##### 

 

    

 7.5 _No Claim Regarding Share Ownership_. No written claim shall have been made by any Person asserting that such Person is the holder or the beneficial owner of, or has the right to acquire or to obtain beneficial ownership of, any stock of, or any other voting, equity, or ownership interest in, any of the Purchased Companies.

 _Article I_) at the time of such expiration: (1) the sum of all claims that
Buyer and Sellers agree are due to Buyershall be paid to Buyer by Escrow
Agent upon the written request of both Buyer and Sellers; (2) the sum of the
claimed amounts that would be payable if all of the outstanding claims were
determined in favor of Buyer, shall remain in escrow; (3) the remaining
balance of the Warranties Escrow after such retention will be so disbursed by
Escrow Agent (pursuant to joint written instructions by Sellers and Buyer) to
Sellers, _pro rata_ , in accordance with the _pro rata_ portion of the
Purchase Price received by Sellers; (4) as each such claim is resolved, any
amount retained with respect thereto that remains in escrow after such
resolution will be disbursed by Escrow Agent (pursuant to joint written
instructions by Sellers and Buyer) to Sellers, _pro rata_ , in accordance with
the _pro rata_  portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers or to the
Buyer in accordance with the determination of such claim; and (5) after all
such claims are determined, then, pursuant to joint written instructions by
Sellers and Buyer, the remaining balance of the Warranties Escrow will
be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Sellers, _pro rata_ , in accordance with
the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers. 

   

 (e) In the event of any conflict between _Section 9.3_ and _Section 9.4_, with respect to Sellers indemnification obligations, this _Section 9.3_ shall control. 

   

 9.4 _Indemnification Procedure_. 

  

 (a) If a claim arises (an "Indemnity Claim") for which a party may have an obligation of indemnity under this _Article IX_ or elsewhere under this Agreement (such party, the "Indemnitor"), the Person entitled to such indemnity (the "Indemnitee") shall give the Indemnitor written notice of such claim setting forth the particulars associated with the claim (including a copy of the written underlying claim of a Third Party, if any) as then known by the Indemnitee ("Indemnity Claim Notice"). Where the underlying claim involves a claim by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall, to the extent practicable, deliver an Indemnity Claim Notice to the Indemnitor within such time as will allow the Indemnitor a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond to the underlying claim; _provided, however_ , that failure to do so shall not affect an Indemnitees rights hereunder except for, and only to the extent of, any incremental increase in the cost of the Indemnity Claim resulting from the failure to give notice. The delivery of an Indemnity Claim Notice shall not extend the time period set forth in _Section 9.3_ or _Article X _(as applicable to the claim), but if an Indemnity Claim Notice is given to an Indemnitor within the applicable time period (if any) with respect to such claim set forth in _Section 9.3_ or _Article X_, such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be effective, subject to the other limitations in _Section 9.3_ (if applicable), as to costs and expenses incurred or suffered after the expiration of any such time period, with respect to the matter described in such Indemnity Claim Notice. 

   

 (b) Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice involving a Third Party Claim for which an Indemnitor believes it may have an obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall, if it so elects in accordance with this _Section 9.4_ (without prejudice to its right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement), assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnitor will not have the authority to subject the Indemnitee to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense. If any Third Party Claim 

    ##### 

  

    

involves a fact pattern wherein each Party may have an obligation to
indemnify the other Party, each Party may assume the defense of and hire
counsel for that portion of the Third Party Claim for which it may have
an obligation of indemnity. In all instances, the Indemnitee may employ
separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim;
_provided, however_ , if the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ and has agreed to indemnify the
Indemnitee, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee shall
be borne solely by the Indemnitee. If (a) the underlying Third Party Claim
plus all previously asserted Indemnity Claims have exceeded the Threshold
Amount, if applicable in the circumstances, and (b) the Indemnitor elects by
written notice to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, then (i) the
Indemnitor shall defend the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim, (ii)
the Indemnitor shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect to
such Third Party Claim, (iii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim that (A) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or
claimant in the matter releases the Indemnitee from all liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim, and (B) would restrict such Indemnitees
ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course, and (iv) the
Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors
prior written consent. If the Indemnitor has not elected to undertake the
defense of a Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnitor assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ but fails to diligently
defend against the Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days following
any written notice from such Indemnitee asserting such failure, then the
Indemnitee shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnitor (to the extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement), the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings.
In such instances, the Indemnitee shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings. The Indemnitor may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by an Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section
9.4_, and the Indemnitor shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section
9.4_, if the Indemnitor disputes its potential liability to the
Indemnitee under this _Section 9.4_ and if such dispute is resolved in favor
of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor shall not be required to bear the costs and
expenses of the Indemnitees defense pursuant to this _Section 9.4_. The
party controlling the defense of the proceedings agrees to afford the other
relevant party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at
conferences with all Persons, including Governmental Entities, asserting any
Indemnity Claim or conferences with representatives of or counsel for such
Persons. The Indemnitor shall pay to the Indemnitee in immediately available
funds any amounts to which the Indemnitee is entitled under this _Article IX_
as agreed to by the parties or as decided by arbitration pursuant to _Section
13.9_, such payment to be made within fifteen (15) days after any such
amounts are determined in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 9.5 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Each of the parties expressly waives and agrees not to seek, and to cause its Affiliates not to seek, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or damages for lost profits of any kind with respect to any dispute arising under, related to, or in connection with this Agreement ("Punitive Damages"), the breach hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any party or its/his Affiliate suffers such damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages) to a Third Party in connection with a claim by a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection 

  ##### 

  

    

with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision
as to the recovery hereunder. 

   

 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. If Closing occurs, the express indemnities set forth in _Article IX_ and elsewhere in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies for the parties for the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or any claim arising out of, resulting from or related to the transactions contemplated hereby, and, except for such remedies, each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby releases, waives and discharges, and covenants not to sue (and shall cause its Affiliates to release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue) the other party(ies) or its/their Affiliates and all such parties stockholders, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives with respect to, any cause of action or Losses, including claims under state or federal securities Laws and Claims available at common Law, in equity or by statute, whether known or unknown, which the releasing party(ies) or its/their respective Affiliates have, based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Companies or the Core Assets. 

  

 9.7 _Express Negligence_. Without limiting or enlarging the scope of the indemnification and release provisions set forth in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, such provisions shall be applicable regardless of whether the liabilities, Losses, costs, expenses and damages in question arise out of or result from the sole, active, passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of any Law or by any Indemnitee or released Person. 

  

 9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments pursuant to this _Article IX_ or _Article VI_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 13.7 _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement or the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement as applied to a particular occurrence or circumstance shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement or the other applicability of such provisions as the case may be.

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 1.5_, _Section 2.5(b)_, _Section 6.10_ and _Section 7.1_, any and all disputes among the parties to this Agreement (defined for purpose of this provision to include the signatory parties and their principals, agents and/or affiliates and/or successors and assigns) arising out of or in connection with the negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or nonperformance of this Agreement and the transaction contemplated herein, and any and all other disputes among these parties, including any dispute as to the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision and any dispute as to arbitrability or jurisdiction of the arbitrator, shall be solely and finally settled by arbitration, which shall be conducted in the metropolitan area of Dallas, Texas. Each party waives any right it may have under law to trial by jury with regard to any dispute it may have against the other. Each party waives any right it may have under law against the other to recover Punitive Damages. Each party waives any right it may have under law to recover any attorneys fees from the other. If the amount in controversy is less than $5,000,000, then a single arbitrator shall be selected by the parties. If the amount in controversy is $5,000,000 or more, then a panel of three arbitrators shall be selected by the parties. Each arbitrator shall be a lawyer familiar with business transactions of the type contemplated in this Agreement who shall not have been previously employed or affiliated with any of the parties hereto. If the parties fail to agree on the selection of the arbitrator or arbitrators within ten (10) days of the date one of them invokes this arbitration provision, either party may apply to the American Arbitration Association to make the appointment of the arbitrator(s), which shall endeavor to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators in number and with the qualifications set forth in the preceding sentences. The selection and appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators by the American Arbitration Association shall be a matter within its sole discretion, and its decision with respect to the qualification and selection of

an arbitrator or arbitrators (including its decision as to the requisite
number of arbitrators required by this Agreement) shall be final and not
subject to judicial review. 

   

 (b) Except as limited by this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) shall have the right to award any relief which the arbitrator(s) deems proper in the circumstances, including without limitation, money damages, interest on unpaid amounts from the date due, specific performance, injunctive relief, and costs; provided, however, that the arbitrator(s) shall not have the authority or right to award Punitive Damages against any party, same having been forever waived and relinquished by these parties, and the arbitrator(s) shall not award attorneys fees to either party as an element of relief except and unless otherwise provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or in another agreement signed by these parties. The parties agree to be bound by the provisions of any prescription or limitation on the period of time within which claims must be brought under applicable law or this Agreement, whichever expires earlier. The parties further agree that, in connection with any such arbitration proceeding, each must submit or file any claim which arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing partys claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the arbitrator(s) cannot acquire jurisdiction, and any such counterclaim (or reconventional demand) which is not submitted or filed shall be forever barred. The parties hereby renounce all recourse to litigation and agree that the award of the arbitrator (or arbitrators) shall be final and subject to no judicial review. The arbitrator(s) shall conduct the proceedings pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as now or hereafter amended. The arbitrator(s) shall decide the issues submitted (i) in accordance with the provisions and commercial purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) with all substantive questions of law determined under the laws of the State of Louisiana (without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws). The arbitrator(s) shall promptly hear and determine (after giving the parties due notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard) the issues submitted and shall render a decision in writing within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the arbitrator(s), or within such shorter or longer period as the arbitrator(s) deems appropriate, it being the parties intent that all disputes be resolved as quickly as feasible under the circumstances, but that the arbitrator(s) shall be the final authority as to the time within which any arbitration proceeding once invoked must be finally completed. 

   

 (c) Judgment on the award of the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction over the party against which enforcement is sought and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of any such court for the purpose of enforcing any such award. The arbitrator(s) shall divide all costs (other than fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in conducting the arbitration in the final award in accordance with what the arbitrator(s) deems just and equitable under the circumstances. 

   

 (d) It is the intent of the parties that this arbitration provision be applied broadly to all disputes now existing or hereafter arising between them, in a manner consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.
