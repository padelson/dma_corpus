money damages, interest on unpaid amounts from the date due, specific performance, injunctive
relief, and costs; provided, however, that the arbitrator(s) shall not have the authority or right
to award Punitive Damages against any party, same having been forever waived and relinquished by
these parties, and the arbitrator(s) shall not award attorneys&#146; fees to either party as an element
of relief except and unless otherwise provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or in another
agreement signed by these parties. The parties agree to be bound by the provisions of any
prescription or limitation on the period of time within which claims must be brought under
applicable law or this Agreement, whichever expires earlier. The parties further agree that, in
connection with any such arbitration proceeding, each must submit or file any claim which arises
out of the same transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party&#146;s claim
and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the arbitrator(s)
cannot acquire jurisdiction, and any such counterclaim (or reconventional demand) which is not
submitted or filed shall be forever barred. The parties hereby renounce all recourse to litigation

Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as now or hereafter amended. The
arbitrator(s) shall decide the issues submitted (i)&nbsp;in accordance with the provisions and
commercial purposes of this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;with all substantive questions of law determined
under the laws of the State of Louisiana (without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws).

reasonable opportunity to be heard) the issues submitted and shall render a decision in writing
within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the appointment of the arbitrator(s), or within such shorter or longer
period as the arbitrator(s) deems appropriate, it being the parties&#146; intent that all disputes be
resolved as quickly as feasible under the circumstances, but that the arbitrator(s) shall be the
final authority as to the time within which any arbitration proceeding once invoked must be finally
completed.

conducting the arbitration in the final award in accordance with what the arbitrator(s) deems just
