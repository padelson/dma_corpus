fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and as of the date hereof the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable

Commitments inaccurate in any material respect, and subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article&nbsp;III, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. Assuming the Financing is funded in
