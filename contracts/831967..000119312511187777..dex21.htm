NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and in consideration of the

intending to be legally bound hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

_Surviving Corporation_ ") as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of Article VII, the closing
of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00
a.m. local time, on the second (2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, date
and time as the Company and Parent shall agree. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended prior to
the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions),
then the Closing shall occur instead on the Business Day following the

Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period, or at such other place,
date and time as the Company and Parent shall agree. The date on which the

executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the TBOC. The Merger
shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas or at such later time
(or subsequent date and time) as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_
".

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the TBOC. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation without any transfer or
assignment having occurred and all claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations,
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

its entirety as the form of the certificate of formation of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, except that the

so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as
provided by applicable law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately

ARTICLE II

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether or not subject to restrictions) (" _Shares_ "),
other than any shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 2.1(b) and
any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive $68.50 in
cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable to the holder thereof, without
interest, in the manner provided in Section 2.5. All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and
the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. If, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is any change in the
number of outstanding Shares as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or
exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Shares,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted accordingly, without
duplication, to provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;

 



3 (b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock and each Share (or other
equity securities of the Company) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no
payment of Merger Consideration shall be made with respect thereto, and any
Shares owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company shall not represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall, at the election of
Parent, either (i) convert into shares of a class of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger or
(ii) be cancelled;

 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and, together with any Shares that were converted into
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section
2.1(b), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation; and

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, Shares
that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by
a shareholder who has not voted such Shares in favor of the Merger and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value of such Shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with (and has otherwise taken
all of the steps required by) Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC to
properly exercise and perfect such shareholders rights of dissent and
appraisal (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be deemed to have ceased to
represent any interest in the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
and shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter
H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that
a shareholder of the Company fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
any such right or remedy granted by the TBOC, the Shares held by such
shareholder shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration specified in Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notices to exercise
dissenters rights in respect of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
notices, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable law that are
received by the Company with respect to shareholders rights of dissent and
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment of
fair value under the TBOC. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle any such demands for payment of fair value under the TBOC.

Section 2.2  _Stock Options, Restricted Shares, RSUs_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed
between Parent and any individual holder, each then-outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any director or
employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable as of, and contingent
upon, the Effective Time, and shall thereupon be converted into the right to
receive, and cancelled in consideration for the payment, at or promptly after
the Effective Time, of, an amount in cash

 



4  equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option and
(ii) the number of Shares such holder had the right to purchase if such
Company Stock Options were fully vested and such holder had exercised such
Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any such
Company Stock Options that have an exercise price per Share which is greater
than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without further payment.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of
restricted Company Common Stock issued under the Company Stock Plans (each, a
" _Restricted Share_ ") shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and an individual holder, to the extent not previously earned and
vested, contingent upon the Effective Time, be deemed fully earned and vested,
and the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each grantee of each Restricted
Share, at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration for each such Restricted Share.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted
stock unit (" _RSU_ ") shall, to the extent not previously earned and vested,
contingent upon the Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and an individual holder, be deemed fully earned and vested as if the
applicable target performance goals had been met (with the balance of the then
unvested RSUs being cancelled), and the Surviving Corporation shall pay to
each grantee of each such vested RSU, at or promptly after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each such RSU;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
all amounts payable in respect of a RSU will be paid in accordance with
the terms of the Company Stock Plans and the applicable award agreement, to
the extent (A) necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional Taxes or
penalties in respect thereof pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or (B) required under a payment
election made by an individual award holder in respect of the applicable RSU.

 

(d) Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this Section 2.2
or is otherwise agreed to in writing between Parent and an individual holder,
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options,
Restricted Shares and RSUs the cash payments described in this Section 2.2
promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the second
(2nd) Business Day after the Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
applicable committee(s) administering the Company Stock Plans, as applicable,
shall use reasonable best efforts (including adopting any required
resolutions) to effect the provisions of this Section 2.2.

 

Section 2.3 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, in
accordance with the terms of the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (i) the
administrator thereof shall determine the date on which the then-current
offering period, if any, shall terminate; and (ii) accumulated payroll
deductions on such date shall be used to purchase the applicable number of
shares. The 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate immediately
following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Company shall take all further actions to ensure that a new
offering period does not begin following the date of this Agreement.

 



5 Section 2.4 _Treatment of Convertible Notes_. Pursuant to the terms of
the Convertible Notes Indenture, after the Effective Time, each holder of the
Convertible Notes, to the extent such holder has not exercised its right to
require the Surviving Corporation to repurchase such holders Convertible
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes and the
Convertible Notes Indenture, will be entitled to convert such holders
Convertible Notes into the right to receive an amount in cash for each $1,000
principal amount of Convertible Notes held by such holder equal to the
product of (a) the Merger Consideration and (b) 19.4764 (plus the increase in
the conversion rate as determined based on the make whole table set forth in
Section 15.03 of the Convertible Notes Indenture to the extent such
Convertible Notes are surrendered for conversion prior to the close of
business on the Business Day immediately prior to, the Fundamental Change
Purchase Date (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture)) (such amount,
the " _Convertible Note Consideration_ "). The Surviving Corporation
(directly or through the Paying Agent) shall pay to each holder of Convertible
Notes that so converts the Convertible Note Consideration as soon as
practicable following such conversion in accordance with the terms of the
Convertible Notes Indenture.

Section 2.5 _Exchange of Shares and Convertible Notes_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement (in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") of the
shareholders of the Company and the holders of Convertible Notes for (i) the
payment of the Merger Consideration to which the shareholders of the Company
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 and (ii) the payment of the
Convertible Note Consideration to which Convertible Note holders shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent an amount in
cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.4
(collectively, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article II
(or, in the event any holder of Convertible Notes surrenders Convertible Notes
for repurchase instead of conversion, to pay the related Fundamental Change
Purchase Price (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) pursuant to
Section 16.02 of the Convertible Notes Indenture), but the Payment Fund may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, _provided_
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this Article II or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of Company Common Stock or the amount of Convertible Note
Consideration payable to Convertible Note holders, and following any losses
Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent to add to the Payment Fund for the benefit of the shareholders of the
Company and Convertible Note holders in the amount of any such losses and (ii)
such investments shall be in short term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, short term
obligations guaranteed by the United States of America, commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively or money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
Parent directs.

 



6 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares, which have converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and such
Certificate shall then be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of
uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") a
check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry
Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York City time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after
the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
DTC Payment.

(d) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it or its designee any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares

 



7  and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have not been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such cash distribution in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates.

(e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting
Shares, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in, this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including making an affidavit to that effect
and, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

hereof there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is
a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing
that could adversely affect the availability of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on
or prior to the date hereof, and as of the date hereof the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to
the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no
fact or occurrence existing that would make any of the statements (including
assumptions) set forth in any of the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any
material respect, and subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party
thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. Assuming the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments and assuming satisfaction
of all of Parents and Merger Subs conditions to Closing, Parent and Merger
Sub will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate amounts to be paid to holders
of Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares, RSUs and the aggregate
Convertible Note Consideration, in each case, as provided in this Agreement,
(ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
Financing and (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of
the Company contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Commitments.
Except with respect to the persons set forth in Section 4.7 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
(for purposes of this Section 4.7, affiliates shall be deemed to include each
direct or indirect Investor in Parent) has entered into any Contract at the
direction or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub prior to the date hereof (i)
awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor
any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) prohibiting or seeking
to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing, from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial
advisory services to any person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. 

 



30 Section 4.8 _Operations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has been formed for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no
other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations
other than as contemplated herein or as incidental thereto. The authorized
capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which 10 shares are validly issued and outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect subsidiary of
Parent.

 

Section 4.9 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub (which shall have
occurred immediately following execution of the Agreement) is the only vote
or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger
Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.10 _Ownership of Shares_. None of Parent or Merger Sub, or any of
their respective subsidiaries beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section
13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder),
or will prior to the Closing Date (other than pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby) beneficially own, any Shares and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, or any of their respective subsidiaries holds any rights to acquire or
vote any Shares except as contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.11 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, (b) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality, "Material Adverse
Effect" or knowledge qualification) and compliance by the Company in all
material respects with the covenants contained in this Agreement and (c) any
estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its subsidiaries have
been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to
be reasonable, immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any Financings in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby), (i) Parent and its subsidiaries(on a
consolidated basis) will not have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay
such debts as they become absolute and matured, (ii) the then present
"fair salable value" (as such quoted term is generally determined in
accordance with applicable laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors) of the assets of Parent and its subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) will exceed the amount that will be required to pay their probable
liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities) and
their debts as they become absolute and matured and (iii) Parent and its
subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will not have unreasonably small
capital to carry on their business as presently conducted or as proposed to be
conducted following the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub are not (x)
causing a transfer of property or incurrence of an obligation in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) entering into the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company. For purposes of this Section 4.11, not having
"an unreasonably small capital to carry on their business as presently
conducted or as proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date" and not
having incurred debts "beyond their ability to pay such debts as they become
absolute and

 



31  matured" means that such persons will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet their obligations as they become absolute and matured.

Section 4.12 _No Competing Business_. To Parents knowledge as of the date
hereof (i) none of Parents affiliates are, in Parents good faith judgment,
engaged in any business which primarily engages in the discovery, development,
manufacture and marketing of wound therapy, advanced wound care and
regenerative medicine products and therapeutic support systems (" _Competing
Business_ ") and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its affiliates beneficially
owns any equity interests or voting securities (including any equity interests
or voting securities that may be acquired through the conversion or exchange
of securities or the exercise of options, warrants or other rights) in excess
of 10% of the outstanding capital stock of, in Parents good faith judgment,
any Competing Business or any person engaged in any Competing Business;
_provided_ that clauses (i) and (ii) shall only apply to Parents affiliates
or Parents or its affiliates ownership interests, respectively, to the
extent such affiliates or ownership interest would, in Parents good faith
judgment, be attributed to Parent or Merger Sub under the HSR Act or the EUMR.

Section 4.13 _Certain Arrangements_. As of the date hereof, there are no
contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or
understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates, on
the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Company Board,
in each case, in his or her individual capacity, on the other hand, relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the
Company after the Effective Time.

Section 4.14 _Investigation; No Other Representations or Warranties_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of
the businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Company and
its subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and Merger Sub has been
provided access to the properties, premises and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub has relied upon its own investigation and analysis, and each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article III, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other person on behalf of the

respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to any other
information provided to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
such employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose any
information or documents to the extent such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its subsidiaries

appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall have the right to:

any inquiry or the making of any proposals or offers that could constitute
Acquisition Proposals, including by way of providing access to non-public
information to any person and its Representatives, its affiliates and its
prospective equity and debt financing sources pursuant to (but only pursuant
to) a confidentiality agreement that contains terms that are not materially
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
prohibit the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal publicly or
privately) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that
the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub (through
an electronic data site or otherwise) any non-public information concerning
the Company or its subsidiaries that the Company provides to any person given
such access that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub;
_provided_ _further_ the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall withhold such portions of documents or information, or
provide pursuant to customary "clean-room" or other appropriate procedures,
to the extent relating to any pricing or other matters that are highly
sensitive or competitive in nature if the exchange of such information could
reasonably be likely to be harmful to the operation of the Company in any
material respect, and (ii) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any persons or groups of
persons and their Representatives, their affiliates and their prospective
equity and debt financing sources with respect to any Acquisition Proposals
or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or
attempt to 

 



38  make any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it and its
subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement or other
agreement with any person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with this Section 6.5.

 

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.5 (including Section 6.5(c)) and except as may relate to any

other Representatives to, (i) at 12:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the 41st
calendar day after the date of this Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start
Date_ ") immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations (or any other actions permitted by Section 6.5(a)) with any
persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and
request promptly thereafter that such persons return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries
provided by the Company or its subsidiaries or Representatives and (ii) from
the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, not (A)
initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (publicly or
otherwise) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or (B) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with respect to, or provide any non-public
information or data concerning the Company or its subsidiaries to any person
relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any
effort or attempt to make or effectuate an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the last sentence of this
Section 6.5(c), at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the
Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any person or group of
persons (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such person or
group of persons solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) the
Company and its Representatives may provide non-public information and
data concerning the Company and its subsidiaries to such person or group of
persons and their Representatives, their affiliates and their prospective
equity and debt financing sources if the Company receives from such person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company
shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub (through an electronic
data site or otherwise) any non-public information concerning the Company or
its subsidiaries that the Company made available to any such person or group
of persons and their Representatives, their affiliates and their prospective
equity and debt financing sources if such information was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_   _further_ the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall withhold such portions
of documents or information, or provide pursuant to customary "clean-room" or
other appropriate procedures, to the extent relating to any pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature if the exchange of
such information could reasonably be likely to be harmful to the operation of
the Company in any material respect and (iii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such person regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if prior to taking any
action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) above, the Company Board determines
in good

 



39  faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 6.5(a)
with respect to any Excluded Parties, including with respect to any amended
proposal that is more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and
submitted by any Excluded Parties following the No-Shop Period Start Date,
and the restrictions in Section 6.5(b) shall not apply with respect thereto;
_provided_ that the provisions of Sections 6.5(e), (g), (h) and (i) shall
apply.

 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person or group of persons other than Parent or one of its
subsidiaries for, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (A)
a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
an acquisition of the Company, (B) the acquisition in any manner, directly or
indirectly, of 20% or more of the equity securities (or securities convertible
into 20% or more of the equity securities) or consolidated total assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in any person, directly or indirectly,
beneficially owning 20% or more of the equity securities (or securities
convertible into 20% or more of the equity securities) of the Company or (D)
any combination of the foregoing, in each case other than the Merger.

 

(ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means any person or group of persons (including,
with respect thereto, their Representatives, their affiliates and their
prospective equity and debt financing sources) from whom the Company has
received during the Go-Shop Period a written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and
outside counsel, is, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that any such person or group of persons shall cease to
be an Excluded Party when the ultimate equityholder(s) of such person and the
other persons who were members of such group of persons, if any, as of the No-
Shop Period Start Date, cease to provide (directly or indirectly) in the
aggregate at least 50% of the equity financing (measured by voting power and
value) of such person or group at any time following the No-Shop Period Start
Date and the Company receives actual notice (or obtains actual knowledge (as
defined in Section 9.3)) thereof.

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%),
that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel (A)
is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof) and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal and (B)
would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys shareholders
from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account the conditionality and the timing and
likelihood of consummation as compared to the transactions

 



40  contemplated hereby and after giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.5(h)).

 

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as set forth in this Section 6.5(e), the Company Board shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) any
Acquisition Proposal, fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or recommendation
statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal (any such action, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); or

(ii) except if it concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.3(a) and immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination pays to
Parent or its designees in immediately available funds any fees required to be
paid pursuant to Section 8.5, cause or permit the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(c)) (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal or requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate, breach or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, so long as
none of the Company, its subsidiaries or their Representatives have breached
in any material respect this Section 6.5, the Company Board may (x) effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel) is a Superior Proposal (including any Superior
Proposal made by an Excluded Party) made after the date hereof (giving effect
to all of the adjustments to be offered to Parent pursuant to Section
6.5(h)), (y) terminate this Agreement under Section 8.3(a) if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement is a Superior Proposal or (z) effect a
Change of Recommendation if developments, circumstances or occurrences that
materially improve the financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of the Company or its subsidiaries that were neither known by the
Company as of the date hereof nor reasonably expected by the Company to occur
as of the date hereof and do not relate to (1) any Acquisition Proposal, (2)
any developments, circumstances or occurrences relating to the Investors,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates as a result of this Agreement,
(3) clearance of the Merger under the HSR Act or any Foreign Merger Control
Laws or (4) the fact, in each case in and of itself, that the Company meets or
exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its
revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations
for any period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after the date
of this Agreement in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common
Stock or the credit rating of the Company (provided, that the developments,
circumstances, facts or

 



41  occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such material improvement or
improvements may be taken into account in the determination under this clause
(4)) (an " _External Event_ ") become known and as a result of such
development, circumstance or occurrence that materially improves the financial
condition, results of operations or prospects of the Company or its
subsidiaries, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.5
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under United States federal or state
law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of the
Company); _provided_ that the Company publicly states that there has been no
change in the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

(g) _Notice_. Within two (2) Business Days following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number and identity of Excluded
Parties and provide Parent with a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal received from an Excluded Party that
was not in writing (which material terms and conditions pursuant to such oral
Acquisition Proposal shall include the identity of the person or group of
persons making such Acquisition Proposal) and, if applicable, copies of all
documents relating to any Acquisition Proposal received from an Excluded
Party. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that
it will promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify
Parent if any Acquisition Proposal is received by, any non-public information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers if such proposals or offers were not made in writing
(which material terms and conditions pursuant to such oral Acquisition
Proposal shall include the identity of the person or group of persons making
such Acquisition Proposal) and, if applicable, copies of all documents
relating thereto, including requests, proposals or offers and proposed
agreements and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any related discussions or negotiations.

(h) The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Recommendation
with respect to a Superior Proposal or to terminate this Agreement under
Section 8.3(a) unless (i) none of the Company, its subsidiaries or their
Representatives have breached in any material respect this Section 6.5, (ii)
the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_
") to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such action and,
if the Superior Proposal was not made in writing, a description of the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
such action and, if applicable, copies of all documents relating thereto
(including the identity of the person making such proposal) including any
related financing commitments, (iii) during the three (3) Business Day period
following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its

 



42  Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to
the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Commitments
so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and
(iv) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement and the Financing Commitments proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial terms
or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this Section 6.5(h); _provided_ , _however_ , that
references herein to the three (3) Business Day period shall be deemed to be
references to a two (2) Business Day period with respect thereto. The Company
shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to an
External Event unless (i) none of the Company, its subsidiaries or their
Representatives have breached in any material respect this Section 6.5, (ii)
the Company has provided a written notice (the " _Notice of External Event_ ")
to Parent and Merger Sub that it will take such action and describing in
detail such External Event, (iii) during the three (3) Business Day period
following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of External Event,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would
no longer be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable law and (iv) following the end of the three
(3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel, taking into account any changes to
this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in response to the notice,
that failure to make a Change of Recommendation with respect to such External
Event would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law. Any material change to the developments, circumstances or occurrences
relating to such External Event shall require a new Notice of External Event
and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of
this Section 6.5(h).

(i) The obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Shareholders Meeting shall not be affected by a Change of Recommendation
unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.3.

 

Section 6.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries
to maintain for Company Employees, for the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time: (i) annual
cash compensation levels (such term to mean (A) annual rate of cash base
salary and wage rates, as applicable and (B) target annual cash incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than such annual
rates of base salary and wage rates, as applicable and such target annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities maintained for and provided to
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) health
and welfare benefits and retirement benefits provided under

 



43  Company Plans (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity compensation),
that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, such health and welfare
benefits, and retirement benefits maintained for and provided to Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans, to the extent
this credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of
service), under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit
(including vacation but excluding for purposes of any equity incentive
compensation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the
benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its
subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees service
with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a "
_Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, regardless as to
whether or not such Parent Plan is subject to ERISA), Parent or its
subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by
the Company and its subsidiaries in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor the Company Plans in accordance with
their terms, including any severance and retention plans and agreements,
subject to the Parents ability to amend any provisions or terminate any
Company Plan consistent with the applicable Company Plan.

(d) This Agreement shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, executors
and legal representatives. Nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied,
(i) is intended to confer on any person (including any Company Employee) or
entity, other than the parties to this Agreement or their respective
successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement and (ii) shall constitute an amendment to any
Company Plan.

 

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any employment agreement or Company Plan as in effect on the date hereof and
which has previously been made available to Parent, from the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer and director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any employee who serves as
a fiduciary of a Company Plan) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
based on or arising out of, or pertaining to, in whole or in part, (x) the
fact that an Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or is or was

 



44  serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity,
(y) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby) or (z)
actions or omissions by an Indemnified Party taken at the request of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (A) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement
of expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred in the
defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.7, (B)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could
be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes a release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents and (C) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the extent permitted by law, contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
former or present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the
Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, with respect to
claims asserted arising from or related to facts, events, acts and/or
omissions which occurred or were committed or allegedly occurred or were
committed at or before the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained, at Parents option: (i) the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company; (ii) a directors
and officers liability "tail" or "runoff" insurance program, with an
aggregate coverage limit over the term of such program in an amount not to
exceed the unimpaired annual aggregate coverage limit under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability policy, and in all other respects
substantially comparable to such existing coverage or (iii) such other
policies of directors and officers liability insurance with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous as those set
forth in the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be
obligated to make a premium payment for such insurance to the extent such
premium exceeds 250% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance, which annual premiums paid are set forth on
Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such 250% amount, the "
_Base Premium_ "); _provided_ _further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot
be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at a premium in excess of the Base
Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors
and officers insurance reasonably available for an annual premium equal to
the Base Premium.

 



45 (d) If Parent does not elect to purchase a "tail" policy, the Company may, at
its option, prior to the Effective Time and in lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, purchase a six (6) year "tail" policy providing at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not, without Parents
consent, make a premium payment for such insurance to the extent such premium
exceeds the Base Premium.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation is made against any Indemnified Party on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and
benefits of this Section 6.7 shall continue in full force and effect until the
final disposition of such claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation.

 

(f) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.7;  _provided_
that such Indemnified Parties make an undertaking to repay such expenses if it
is determined that they were not entitled to indemnification or expense
reimbursement under this Section 6.7. The indemnification provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(g) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7.

 

Section 6.8 _Further Action; Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable (including
under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Merger Control Law, including in connection
with any filing relating to CFIUS, and including obtaining all approvals,
consents, waivers of any third party necessary, proper or advisable) to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, (ii) do all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including:
(A) causing the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices
required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the taking of such actions
as are necessary to obtain any requisite consent or approval, or expiration of
any applicable waiting period under, the HSR Act, any applicable Antitrust Law
or any applicable Foreign Merger Control Law or with respect to CFIUS and (B)
using reasonable best efforts to defend all lawsuits and other proceedings by
or before any

 



46  Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger and (iii) resolve any objection asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement under any Antitrust Law or
Foreign Merger Control Law raised by any Governmental Entity and to prevent
the entry of any court order, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any injunction, decree, ruling, order or other action of
any Governmental Entity that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated pursuant to this Agreement to,
and the Company shall not without the written consent of Parent, divest or
hold separate any assets or to take or commit to take any action which would
be reasonably likely to (i) materially adversely impact the benefits expected
to be derived by Parent, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) impose material limitations on Parents ownership or
operation (or that of any of Parents subsidiaries or affiliates) of all or a
material portion of the Companys business or assets.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 6.8(a),
each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
reasonably practicable, (A) and in any event by no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days from the date of this Agreement (i) an appropriate Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii) an appropriate notification form
pursuant to the requirements of the Canadian Competition Act, as amended and
(iii) an appropriate notification form pursuant to the requirements of Brazil
Antitrust Law of June 11, 1994, as amended, and any regulations and
resolutions promulgated in connection therewith, and (iv) any draft filings,
notifications or reports required under the EUMR and (B) to the extent
required, any initial filings, notifications or reports required under the
jurisdictions set forth on Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Parent shall pay all filing fees for the filings required under the HSR Act
by the Company and Parent.

(c) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of significant
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of
or clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

 

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Merger Control Law and
coordinating with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before
the relevant Governmental Entities and as to the contents of all material
communications with such Governmental Entities. In particular, to the extent
permitted by law or Governmental Entity, no party will make any material
notification to any Governmental Entity in relation to the transactions
contemplated hereunder without first providing the other party with a copy of
such notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account of
all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect;

(ii) furnishing, to the extent permitted by law, to the other party all
necessary information that the other party may reasonably request in

or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by law or Governmental
Entity that each of the parties is given the opportunity to attend any
meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Parent will, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, commence
discussions with the CFIUS staff regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and Parent and the Company will as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof cooperate to prepare the notice pursuant to the Exon-
Florio Amendment to be used if Parent deems such filing necessary. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company shall commence preparation of such
notice prior to receipt of or any guidance on a final determination, if any,
from the CFIUS staff, and, so long as the Company timely provides all
reasonable cooperation in connection therewith, including providing all
information reasonably necessary for the preparation of a draft joint
notice, Parent shall within twenty (20) Business Days of the date hereof
either (i) provide the initial draft joint notice pursuant to the Exon-Florio
Amendment to the CFIUS staff, if Parent deems such filing necessary or (ii)
notify the Company that it does not deem such filing necessary.

(e) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and copies
of any correspondence to or from the FDA, any Foreign Regulatory Entity or
Healthcare Governmental Entity containing substantive, factual or legal issues
that relate to the compliance status of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
and/or any of their respective products or otherwise provide the other party
with reasonable information or respond to reasonable requests for information
with respect to such matters. The Company shall give due consideration,
following reasonable prior notice to Parent, to any advice from Parent as to
how to respond to any material correspondence from the FDA, any Foreign
Regulatory Entity or Healthcare Governmental Entity or with respect to any
other material submissions to any of the foregoing. If the Company is invited
to participate in any meeting with the FDA with respect to the letter received
on May 5, 2011, any warning letter, untitled letter, notice of violation
letter, FDA establishment inspection close-out, recall, or any enforcement
action initiated by FDA, or invited to participate in any meeting with any
Foreign Regulatory Entity pertaining to similar matters, then the Company
shall give Parent reasonable prior notice of such meeting and invite one
outside representative of Parent (designated by Parent and who is qualified
as a subject matter expert reasonably acceptable to the Company) to attend
such meeting unless prohibited by the FDA or such Foreign Regulatory Entity.
The Company will (i) cooperate with, and provide reasonable access to,
Parents representative for purposes of reviewing and assessing the Companys
FDA and Healthcare Law compliance programs and procedures, (ii) give due
consideration to any resulting recommendations provided by Parents
representative and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to implement any such
recommendations that it considers, in its own good faith judgment, to be
advisable.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.8, commercially
and/or competitively sensitive information and materials of a party will be
provided to the other party on an outside counsel-only basis while, to the
extent feasible, making a version in which the commercial and/or competitively
sensitive information has been redacted available to the other party.

 



48 Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any
such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such
consultation except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.
Parent and the Company agree that the initial press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent
and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.9
shall limit the Companys or the Company Boards rights to make public
statements about its actions under Section 6.5 without prior consultation.

 

Section 6.10 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If the restrictive provisions of any
Anti-Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to this Agreement
(including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of
Parent, the Company and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors
shall grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

 

Section 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would reasonably be expected to cause
or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed
in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not (x) cure
any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement
or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. The
parties agree and acknowledge that the Companys, on the one hand, and
Parents on the other hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this
Section 6.11 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the condition referred to in Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.3(b),
respectively, shall have been satisfied.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any shareholder or
derivative suit, action, litigation or claim related to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought,
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, against the
Company and/or the members of the Company Board prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such suit, litigation or claim
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect to the defense
or settlement of any such suit, litigation or claim, and no settlement thereof
shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.

take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.13 _Treatment of Notes; Credit Agreement_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions
(i) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture dated as of April 21, 2008,

Indenture, and delivery of any supplemental indentures, legal opinions,
officers certificates or other documents or instruments required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and (ii) to facilitate the

terms thereof, including the provision that, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding Convertible Note shall no longer be convertible into shares of
Company Common Stock and shall be convertible solely into the Merger
Consideration and other payments under this Agreement that the holder of such
Convertible Note would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger if
such holder had converted such Convertible Note immediately prior to the
Effective Time in connection with a "Fundamental Change" and/or "Make-Whole
Fundamental Change" (as such terms are defined in the Convertible Notes
Indenture).

 

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver
to Parent copies of a payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged
by Parent), in commercially reasonable form, from the administrative agent
under the Credit Agreement and shall make arrangements for the release of all
Liens and other security over the Companys and its subsidiaries properties
and assets securing its obligations under the Credit Agreement, together with

Agreement, Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all documented reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and the fees of any dealer manager,
information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with this
Agreement) incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and its subsidiaries contemplated by this
Section 6.13. Without duplication of any amounts to be reimbursed by Parent
pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence, if the Closing does not occur,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and
their respective officers, advisors and 

 



50  Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with their cooperation with Parent as contemplated
by this Section 6.13.

respective obligations under this Agreement.

Section 6.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligations to
consummate the Closing are not subject to a financing condition under Article
VII.

(b) Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under the Debt Financing Commitments
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to
consummate the Merger and repay or refinance the debt contemplated in this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments including all fees and expenses related
in each case thereto or (y) impose new or additional conditions to the
receipt of the Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected to (1) expand
in any material respect the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding at Closing or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (2) materially adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Financing Commitments ( _provided_ , that, subject to
Section 6.15(d), for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may
replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, if the
addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the
availability of the financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in
or contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitments, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments (including by consummating the
financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments) and
otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements being referred to
as the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or terms
and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub
(in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms and conditions in the
Debt Financing Commitments), (iv) in the event that all conditions in the
Debt Financing Commitments (other than the availability or funding of any
Equity Financing) have been satisfied, consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing
Commitments and (vi) in the event that all conditions in the Debt Financing
Commitments (other than the availability or funding of any Equity Financing)
have been satisfied, cause the lenders and other persons providing Debt
Financing to fund on the Closing

 



51  Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall (x) furnish to the Company
complete, correct and executed copies of the Debt Financing Agreements, (y)
give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of any of
the Financing Commitments or the Debt Financing Agreements of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) upon the
Companys request, otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of Parents and Merger Subs efforts to arrange the Financing (or any
replacement thereof). If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) or from sources contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative
debt financing from alternative debt sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon terms and
conditions not less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (in
the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those in the Debt Financing
Commitments as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
including using reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any
Investor be required to provide any financing other than equity financing,
which equity shall in no event exceed the amount set forth in its respective
Equity Financing Commitments, and in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required to (i) seek or obtain equity financing other than the Equity
Financing or (ii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments, or agree to any "market flex" term less favorable to
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation than such corresponding
market flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions
contained therein or otherwise). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing
Period_ " shall mean the first period of twenty (20) consecutive Business Days
throughout which (x) Parent shall have all of the Required Financial
Information and during which period such information shall remain compliant
in all material respects at all times with the applicable provisions of
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, provided, that if
the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has provided the
Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice
(stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the
Company shall be deemed to have complied with clause (x) above unless Parent
in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed the delivery
of the Required Financial Information (or Parent cannot confirm whether the
Company has completed the delivery of the Required Financial Information) and
within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the
Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating, to
the extent reasonably practicable, which Required Financial Information the
Company has not delivered) and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1
and 7.2(c) shall be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing) and nothing has occurred
and no condition exists that would cause any of the other conditions set
forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be satisfied, assuming that the Closing Date
were to be scheduled for any time during such twenty (20) consecutive Business
Day period; _provided_ that if all the conditions set forth in the foregoing
clauses (x) and (y) have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied
throughout the twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period), except that the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) has not been satisfied because the
Shareholders Meeting has not yet been held, then the Marketing Period shall
commence on the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date of
the Shareholders Meeting (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not end prior
to the date that is twenty (20) consecutive Business Days following the

 



52  commencement of such Marketing Period) provided that there have been no
Acquisition Proposals publicly announced (and not publicly withdrawn) as of
such time; _provided_ _further_ that if the Marketing Period would not end on
or prior to August 19, 2011, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier
than September 6, 2011; _provided_ _further_ that if the Marketing Period
would not end on or prior to December 20, 2011, the Marketing Period shall
commence no earlier than January 2, 2012; _provided_ _further_ that the
Marketing Period will not be deemed to have commenced if prior to the
completion of the Marketing Period, (w) the Companys auditors shall have
withdrawn their audit opinion contained in the SEC Reports or the Required
Financial Information, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed
to commence unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with
respect thereto by the Companys auditors or another independent public
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent, (x) the financial statements
included in the Required Financial Information that is available to Parent on
the first day of the Marketing Period would not be sufficiently current on any
day during such period to satisfy the requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation
S-X to permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period, in which case
the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the receipt by
Parent of updated Required Financial Information that would be required under
Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such
financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of
such new twenty (20) consecutive Business Day period, (y) the Company issues a
public statement indicating its intent to restate any historical financial
statements of the Company or that any such restatement is under consideration
or may be a possibility, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be
deemed to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and
the relevant SEC Report or SEC Reports have been amended or the Company has
announced that it has concluded that no restatement shall be required in
accordance with GAAP or (z) the Company shall have been delinquent in filing
any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in which case the Marketing Period will not
be deemed to commence unless and until all such delinquencies have been cured;
_provided_ that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is
the date on which the Debt Financing is obtained.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall and shall cause its subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its respective
Representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole
expense, all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that
is necessary in connection with the Financing, including (i) furnishing
Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries and the related statements
of income, change in equity and cash flows as of the end of any quarterly
period ending after the execution of this Agreement all Company information,
financial statements and financial data of the type required in registration
statements on Form S-1 by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act and of a type and form customarily included in private
placements pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act for financings
similar to the Financing and subject to exceptions customary for
such financings (including, to the extent applicable with respect to such
financial statements, the report of the Companys auditors thereon and
including customary "Risk Factors", "Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
Financial Information", "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data",
"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations", "Business", "Management" and "Certain Relationships and Related

document) and including audited financial statements as of December 31, 2009
and 2010, and for each of the fiscal years 

 



53  in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010) and including the other
financial data and financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries
that are required under Sections 9 and 10 of Exhibit E to the Debt Financing
Commitment, and customary pro forma financial statements (information required
to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as, the "
_Required Financial Information_ "), (ii) participating in a reasonable
number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties
acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers
of, the Financing and senior management and Representatives, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, of the Company), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Financing, (iii) assisting with the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda, offering documents, private placement memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with the Financing (including requesting any
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation
letters), (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort
letters and legal opinions as reasonably requested by Parent and facilitate
the pledging of collateral in connection with the Financing, including,
executing and delivering any customary pledge and security documents
(including security documents to be filed with the United States Copyright
Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register
copyrights, patents and trademarks, as applicable, of the Company and its
subsidiaries to the extent required in connection with the Financing),
currency or interest hedging arrangements or other definitive financing
documents or other certificates, legal opinions, surveys, title insurance and
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of
the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters
as of the Closing, on a pro forma basis), (v) causing the taking of corporate
actions (subject to the occurrence of the Closing) by the Company and its

_however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its subsidiaries. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action that would subject it to actual or
potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other liability or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or
any of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, unless such action is
contingent upon the Closing. If the Closing does not occur, Parent

 



54  shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and the
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.15(c)) and any

information relating to the Company or its subsidiaries or other information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries). Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall from time to time, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with
this Section 6.15(c). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the

or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

(d) In no event shall Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (for
purposes of this Section 6.15(d), affiliates shall be deemed to include each
direct or indirect investor in Parent) taking action on behalf of or at the
direction of any Investor, Parent or Merger Sub, enter into any agreement from
and after the date hereof to (i) award any agent, broker, investment banker
or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in
connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii)

_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate

7.3(a) or 7.3(b) not to be capable of being satisfied.

Section 8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect with no liability to any person on the part of any party hereto (or
of any of its subsidiaries, officers or directors or any Parent Related
Party); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, that (i) except as otherwise provided herein and subject to
Section 8.5(d) (including the limitation on liability set forth therein), no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for damages
to the other party hereto resulting from willful and intentional breach of
this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 6.13(c), Section
6.15(c), this Section 8.5 and Article IX, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Equity Financing Commitments (to the extent set forth therein) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"willful and intentional breach" shall mean a material breach that is a
consequence of an omission by, or act undertaken by or caused by, the
breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the omission
or taking or causing of such act would, or would reasonably be expected to,
cause a breach of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that:

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a), Section
8.2(b) or Section 8.4(c), (y) any person shall have publicly announced or
otherwise communicated (which communication, for purposes of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) of the preceding clause (x) only, shall be public)
to the Company Board or the Companys shareholders an Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement but prior to such termination, which

 



59  Acquisition Proposal had not been publicly withdrawn prior to (1) the
termination of this Agreement (in connection with a termination pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.4(c) of the preceding clause (x)) or (2) the
Shareholders Meeting (in connection with a termination pursuant to Section
8.2(b) of the preceding clause (x)), and (z) prior to or within twelve (12)
months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or consummated any
Acquisition Proposal (in each case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is
the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (y)) ( _provided_ that
for purposes of this Section 8.5(b)(i), the references to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%");

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or
8.4(b) (or is terminated by the Company at a time when this Agreement was
terminable pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or 8.4(b)); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

then the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) above, concurrently with
the occurrence of the applicable event, (B) in the case of clause (ii) above,
no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination and
(C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or concurrently
with such termination, pay Parent or its designee the Termination Fee (as
defined below) by wire transfer of immediately available funds (it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion). " _Termination Fee_ " shall
mean (1) an amount equal to $51,800,000 if the Termination Fee becomes payable
in connection with the Company entering into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with an Excluded Party and (2) an amount equal to
$155,400,000 in all other circumstances.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(x) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, at such time, all of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 have been and continue to be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot
be satisfied other than at Closing) and Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement when the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, or (y) by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(c), then Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company an amount
equal to $317,200,000 (the " _Parent Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required
to pay the Parent Fee on more than one occasion).

It is agreed that the Parent Fee is liquidated damages and not a penalty,
and the payment of the Parent Fee in the circumstances specified herein is
supported by due and sufficient consideration.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay the

 



60  amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amount set forth in Section 8.5(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment
against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parents or Merger Subs designee, on the
one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (x) the Companys right to terminate this
Agreement and receive the Parent Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5 (including
the right to enforce the Equity Financing Commitments with respect thereto)
shall, upon full payment to the Company of the Parent Fee, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and its affiliates against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Investors, the financing sources under the Debt Financing Commitments
and any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, affiliates,
affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, employees, representatives, assignees
or agents (" _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of
any breach of any representation, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith (
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the
foregoing with respect to oral representations in no way limits Section 3.27
or 9.5), in each case, in any circumstance in which the Company is permitted
to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Fee pursuant to this
Section 8.5 and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except that such parties shall remain obligated for, and the
Company and its subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement and any reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 8.5(d)), the Equity Financing
Commitments or in respect of oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge that the foregoing with respect to oral
representations in no way limits Section 3.27 or 9.5), whether (to the extent
valid under applicable law) in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (y) in connection with any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith (
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the
foregoing with respect to oral representations in no way limits Section 3.27
or 9.5), in each case, other than in a circumstance in which the Company is
permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.5, the Company agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of
Parent and Merger Sub shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Parent Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek to recover any money
damages in excess of such amount (except that such parties shall remain
obligated for, and the Company and its subsidiaries may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement). In no event shall
the Company seek to recover monetary damages from any Parent Related Party
(other than Parent and Merger Sub). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, (i) Parent shall not be entitled to specific performance
under Section 9.10 if the Company has previously paid in full, and Parent

 



61  or Merger Sub has elected to accept and has accepted, the Termination Fee
and (ii) each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees on behalf of
itself and its affiliates that if the Termination Fee becomes payable
pursuant to Section 8.5 and is paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.5 and
Parent or Merger Sub has elected to accept and has accepted the Termination
Fee, the right to receive the Termination Fee, together with reimbursement of
any applicable reimbursement obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 8.5(d), shall constitute each of Parents and Merger Subs and
each of their affiliates sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement,
and, in such case, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages and not a penalty (and the payment of the Termination Fee
in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration) for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub and each of their affiliates and any other person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination and
none of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective affiliates or any other person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against the Company or any affiliate of the Company arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any
matters forming the basis for such termination.

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
including Section 6.13, Section 6.15 and the first sentence of Section 8.5(d),
each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Expenses incurred in connection with
the printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement shall be borne by the
Company.

Section 8.7  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no
amendment may be made which by law requires the further approval of the
shareholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto.

 

Section 8.8 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby and references
this Section 8.8 or a waiver under this Agreement. The failure of any party to
assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or
remedies.

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 9.6  _Parties in Interest_. Except as provided in Section 6.7 and
this Section 9.6, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and

 



68  covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein other than,
if the Effective Time occurs, the right of (a) the Companys shareholders to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article II and (b) the holders of
Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs to receive the amounts
specified in Section 2.2. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under Section 6.7 shall not arise unless and until

Financing Commitments and their respective affiliates shall be considered
third party beneficiaries with respect to Section 8.5(a), Section 8.5(c),
Section 8.5(d), Section 9.4, Section 9.11 and Section 9.13 and Parent Related
Parties shall be considered third party beneficiaries with respect to Section
8.5(d) and Section 9.14. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.8 without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles
thereof), except to the extent that the provisions of the TBOC are applicable,
in which case the TBOC shall apply.

Section 9.8 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.9  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile, ".pdf," or other electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled

 



69  at law or in equity; _provided_ that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance as a third party beneficiary of Parents rights against
the Investors under the Equity Financing Commitments that relate to the
equity commitment relating to a portion of the Merger Consideration, subject
to the terms thereof, and to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to draw down the
full proceeds of the Equity Financing and to cause Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the
Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, if, but only if: (A) all conditions in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (C) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative
financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.15, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (D) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged
and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to enforce, including against anticipatory breach,
the obligations of the lenders to fund the Debt Financing under the Debt
Financing Commitment, but only in the event that each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), and Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 1.2 and (ii) all of the conditions to the consummation of
the financing provided by the Debt Financing Commitment (or, if alternative
financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.15, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing).
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the
Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the aggregate amount of
the Parent Fee.

Section 9.11 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, of any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) except as set
forth below, agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the Delaware state or federal courts within the State of
Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to service being made through
the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.2. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice
or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in
Section 9.2 shall be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding
in connection

 



70  with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
hereby further agree that New York state or United States Federal courts
sitting in the borough of Manhattan, City of New York shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over any action brought against any financing source under the
Debt Financing Commitments or any of their respective affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.12 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

 

Section 9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING THE
FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES) OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF AND
THEREOF.

 

Section 9.14 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto and no other Parent Related Party that is not a party
hereto (other than the Investors to the extent set forth in the Equity
Financing Commitments) shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether (to the
extent valid under applicable law) in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge that the foregoing with respect to oral representations in no way
limits Section 3.27 or 9.5). In no event shall the Company or any of its
affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its controlled
affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from,
any Parent Related Party not a party to this Agreement (other than to the
extent set forth in the Equity Financing Commitments).
