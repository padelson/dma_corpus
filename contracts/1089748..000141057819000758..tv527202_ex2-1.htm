Interests; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) _Transferred Assets; Transferred Equity Interests_. Pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, (i) Seller will, and will cause the Asset Selling Companies and any

Closing, as applicable, an assignment and assumption agreement and bill of
sale in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the " _General Assignment and Assumption
Agreement_ "), an agreement with respect to Buyer's post-closing use of

Assumed Liabilities and shall agree to satisfy and discharge when due the
liabilities and obligations of Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to the

doubt, Buyer shall not be released from any liability or obligation hereunder

as and when due, the Assumed Liabilities. Buyer shall promptly reimburse

Liability the performance of which by, or on behalf of, Buyer or any of its

lawful rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of Huntsman
International (India) Private Limited, the assumption of Assumed Liabilities
of Huntsman International (India) Private Limited shall be undertaken by the
relevant Buyer Assignee from and after the Closing, but effective on the India

the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Equity Interests or the Employees or
any assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in each territory set forth on
_Annex A_ (which annex may be updated or modified from time to time by
agreement of Buyer and Seller) at the Closing (or, in the case of a Deferred
Transfer, at the closing of such Deferred Transfer). The Business Transfer
Documents shall be in form and substance reasonably agreed to by the Parties

reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by either Buyer or Seller under

Section 2.2   _Deposit; Purchase Price at Closing_.

  



  

(a) Prior to or substantially concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Buyer has deposited with the Deposit Escrow Agent, to be held
in escrow by the Deposit Escrow Agent, by bank wire transfer of immediately
available funds, a deposit in the amount of Fifty Million U.S. Dollars
$50,000,000 (the " _Deposit_ "). The Deposit shall not be subject to any
Encumbrance, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of Buyer. Buyer shall obtain and post the Qualifying Letter of
Credit and deliver such Qualifying Letter of Credit to Seller prior to 5:00
p.m. New York local time on September 4, 2019. Buyer's failure to comply with
the obligation set forth in the foregoing two sentences shall be deemed a
material breach of this Agreement by Buyer. Solely upon delivery to Seller of
the Qualifying Letter of Credit, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a Disbursement
Request (as defined in the Deposit Escrow Agreement) signed by Seller,
whereupon Buyer shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally authorized to
countersign and deliver such Disbursement Request to the Deposit Escrow Agent
and obtain a return of the Deposit. Buyer and Seller hereby agree that the
Qualifying Letter of Credit may be drawn by Seller upon satisfaction of the
Draw Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the proceeds of the
Qualifying Letter of Credit nor the amount of the Deposit shall in any case
be the sole or exclusive remedy for any Losses or damages incurred by Seller
or limit or waive the right of Seller to pursue its remedies of specific
performance set forth in _Section 13.16_ or any other legal or equitable
remedies under this Agreement. If the Closing occurs, (i) Buyer shall be
entitled to the entire Escrow Fund (as defined in the Deposit Escrow
Agreement) free of any offset, defense or counterclaim by Seller and (ii) if
the Qualifying Letter of Credit remains undrawn, it shall be immediately
returned by Seller to Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
or otherwise, Seller shall be responsible for all costs, fees and expense,
including attorneys' fees and related costs, associated with obtaining such
Qualifying Letter of Credit, up to an aggregate amount of Two Million U.S.
Dollars ($2,000,000).

  



  

(b) As an inducement to Seller to enter into this Agreement, Buyer
Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
due and punctual observance and performance of each and every obligation
(including all performance and payment obligations) undertaken by Buyer in
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer Guarantor consents and
agrees to be held jointly liable with Buyer with respect to any of Buyer's
obligations contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. This
guarantee is an irrevocable guaranty of payment and shall continue in effect
notwithstanding any extension or modification of the terms of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 13.2_. Buyer Guarantor hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require
any proceeding first against Buyer, any Buyer Assignee or the Business, as
applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the
performance of its obligations set forth in this _Section 2.2(b)_. Buyer
Guarantor has sufficient cash on hand or other sources of immediately
available funds to enable it to guarantee all amounts payable by Buyer under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay (or shall cause one or more of
its Affiliates as Buyer may designate to pay), on behalf of Buyer and any
applicable Buyer Assignees, to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as
Seller may designate), on behalf of Seller and the other Selling Companies,
an amount equal to Two Billion U.S. Dollars ($2,000,000,000) (the " _Purchase
Price_ "), which amount shall be payable as set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_
and adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_. The Purchase Price shall be paid
in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a U.S. bank account in
accordance with written instructions delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of Huntsman International
(India) Private Limited, payment shall be made by the Buyer Assignee to
Huntsman International (India) Private Limited in India on the Closing Date
(or Deferred Closing Date, if applicable). Following the Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be subject to further adjustment as provided for in _Section
2.3_.

  



  

(d) On or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "
_Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth good faith estimates of the following
amounts: (i) Funded Indebtedness and Cash Equivalents of the Transferred
Companies, the Intercompany Payable Amount, and the Intercompany Receivable
Amount, in each case as of the Closing Date, (ii) based on the estimates
described in _clause (i)_ , the Net Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Net Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Inventory, Accounts Receivable (other
than Retained Business Allocated Accounts Receivable), Other Current Assets
and Accounts Payable (other than Retained Business Allocated Accounts
Payable), in each case as of the Closing Date and (iv) based on the estimates
described in _clause (iii)_ , the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ").

  



  

(e) The Purchase Price specified in _Section 2.2(a)_ to be paid at
the Closing shall be (i) increased, if the Estimated Net Indebtedness is a
negative number, on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount equal to the
absolute value of the Estimated Net Indebtedness or (ii) decreased, if the
Estimated Net Indebtedness is a positive number, on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the amount equal to the Estimated Net Indebtedness. The Purchase Price
specified in _Section 2.2(c)_ to be paid at the Closing shall be (i)
decreased, by the amount (if any), by which the Estimated Net Working Capital
is less than the Net Working Capital Target, on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
the amount of such deficit or (ii) increased, by the amount (if any), by which
the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Target on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess.

  



  

Section 2.3   _Purchase Price Adjustment Following Closing_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (in its draft form, the " _Price
Adjustment Statement_ "), setting forth (i) the Net Working Capital
transferred to Buyer (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the Net
Indebtedness (the " _Closing Net Indebtedness_ ") in each case as of the
Effective Time, which Price Adjustment Statement shall include (i) a worksheet
setting forth in reasonable detail how such amounts were calculated and (ii)
reasonable supporting evidence for all significant balances and deviations and
underlying calculations on a general ledger level of detail to the extent
available. To the extent that the Closing Net Working Capital is greater
than or less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as described in _Section 2.3(h)_ below. To the extent that the
Closing Net Indebtedness is greater than or less than the Estimated Net
Indebtedness, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as described in _Section
2.3(i)_ below. The Price Adjustment Statement shall be in the form of
_Schedule 2.3(a)_, which sets forth an example of the calculation of Net
Working Capital and Net Indebtedness as of March 31, 2019. Additionally,
until the Closing, Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
or objections made in good faith by Buyer with respect to the Estimated
Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, no disagreement among the Parties with
respect to the Estimated Statement shall delay the Closing and the amounts set
forth in the Estimated Statement shall be used to consummate the Closing.

  



  

   

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In connection with the preparation and review of the Price
Adjustment Statement, (i) Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within such
time frame as reasonably required by Seller, (A) assist, and shall cause its
Affiliates to assist, Seller and its Representatives in Seller's preparation
of the Price Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to Seller and its
Representatives, access to current and former advisors or the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Business in the possession of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to the extent relevant to the preparation of the Price
Adjustment Statement (including any taking and preparing of physical counts
of Inventory) and (ii) Seller shall promptly, and in any event within such
time frame as reasonably required by Buyer, afford to Buyer and its
Representatives, access to the current or former advisors or personnel,
properties, books and records of the Business in the possession of Seller or
any of its Affiliates to the extent relevant to the review of the
Price Adjustment Statement. Each Party shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, take any action limiting the other Party's reasonable
access to the current and former advisors or personnel, properties, book or
records as set forth in the foregoing sentence.

  



  

(c) The Price Adjustment Statement shall become final, conclusive
and binding upon the Parties on the forty-fifth (45th) day following receipt
thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify (i) in reasonable detail the nature and amount of
any disagreement so asserted; (ii) disagreements with respect to (and only
with respect to) (A) whether the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital
or Closing Net Indebtedness was prepared in accordance with this _Section
2.3_, specifically, whether the Closing Accounting Principles were used, (B)
whether the Price Adjustment Statement was prepared in accordance with the
accounting procedures and principles described in _Section 2.6_, and (C)
whether there were mathematical errors in the Price Adjustment Statement; and
(iii) the amount that Buyer reasonably believes is the correct Closing Net
Working Capital or Closing Net Indebtedness, as applicable, based on the
disagreements set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, including a reasonably
detailed description of the adjustments applied to the Price Adjustment
Statement in calculating such amount. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is
received by Seller, then the Price Adjustment Statement (as revised in
accordance with _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ below) shall become final and binding
upon the Parties on the earlier of (x) the date the Parties resolve any
differences they have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of
Disagreement or (y) the date Ernst and Young LLP or, if Ernst and Young LLP is
unable or unwilling to serve, another international accounting firm mutually
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (such firm, the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
delivers the final Price Adjustment Statement to the Parties (in accordance
with the procedure set forth in this _Section 2.3_).

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d)  During the thirty- (30) day period immediately following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty-
(30) day period, if not resolved, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and
resolution by the Accounting Firm any and all matters that were included in
the Notice of Disagreement and remain in dispute, and the Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination of the values set forth on the Price
Adjustment Statement (and shall use such determination to prepare the final
Price Adjustment Statement), which determination shall be binding on the
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , the scope of such determination by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to those matters that remain in dispute and
that were included in the Notice of Disagreement (including any sub-matters
subordinate to a larger included matter), and only with respect to
such matters permitted to be included in the Notice of Disagreement and on
the grounds for which a Notice of Disagreement may be based pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to
make any other determination.

  



  

(e) Without limiting the generality of this _Section 2.3_, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination
as to the accuracy of _Section 5.5_ or any other representation or warranty
in this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller or any of its Affiliates with
any of the covenants in this Agreement (other than this _Section 2.3_). The
Accounting Firm shall make its final determination of the matters in dispute
based solely on (A) the definitions and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement (and shall not conduct an independent investigation), (B) a single
written presentation submitted by each of Buyer and Seller (which the
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to distribute to Buyer and Seller upon
receipt of both such presentations) and (C) one written response of Buyer and
Seller to each such presentation so submitted (which the Accounting Firm
shall be instructed to distribute to Buyer and Seller upon receipt of such
responses). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor Seller shall have
any _ex parte_ communications with the Accounting Firm relating to this
_Section 2.3_ or this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither the calculations nor the purchase price adjustment to be made
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ is intended to be used to adjust for errors or
omissions, including with respect to any adjustment proposed by auditors
(whether or not made), that may be found with respect to the Financial
Statements, for which _Article XI _shall be the sole and exclusive remedy.
It is understood that (i) the example calculation of Net Working Capital
set forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ is attached only for the purposes set forth
in the definition of "Net Working Capital" and (ii) the Net Working Capital
Target is a negotiated number derived independently of the example calculation
of Net Working Capital set forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_.

Firm, as applicable, shall (i) be in writing; (ii) include the Accounting
Firm's or the Actuary Firm's, as applicable, calculation of the purchase

(g) A Party claiming that any other Party has failed to comply with
its obligations under _Section 2.3(b)_ or _Section 2.3(j)_, as applicable,
to provide access to information may initiate the appointment or engagement of
the Accounting Firm or the Actuary Firm, as applicable, by making a written
request directly to the Accounting Firm or the Actuary Firm, as applicable;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Party making such claim must provide
prompt prior written to notice to the other Party of its intent to appoint
the Accounting Firm or the Actuary Firm, as applicable, and a reasonable
period of time for the other Party to cure any such alleged failure. If any
Party initiates the appointment or engagement of the Accounting Firm or the
Actuary Firm, as applicable, under this _Section 2.3(g)_, the Accounting
Firm or the Actuary Firm, as applicable, shall have the authority: (i)
to determine if a Party has complied with its obligations to provide access
to the information required pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ or _Section
2.3(j)_, as applicable, and to order that a Party comply with any such
obligations; (ii) to extend any deadlines set forth in this _Section 2.3_,
including the immediate temporary suspension of such deadlines during the time
period necessary to resolve the disputed issue; and (iii) to allow a Party
the right to amend any prior Price Adjustment Statement, Actuary Adjustment
Statement, Notice of Disagreement, or Actuary Notice of Disagreement where it
finds that such Party had been prejudiced by the failure to have been
provided access to such information.

  



  

(h) If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that Closing
Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the amount
of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase
Price and if the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Closing
Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the
Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of
such deficit; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the final Price
Adjustment Statement discloses that the Closing Net Working Capital is equal
to the Estimated Net Working Capital, then there shall be no adjustment under
this _Section 2.3(h)_ to the Purchase Price.

  



  

(i) If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that
Estimated Net Indebtedness exceeds the Closing Net Indebtedness, then the
amount of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the
Purchase Price. If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that
Estimated Net Indebtedness is less than the Closing Net Indebtedness, then
the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
amount of such deficit. If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that
Estimated Net Indebtedness is equal to Closing Net Indebtedness, then there
shall be no adjustment under this _Section 2.3(i)_ to the Purchase Price.

(j) On or before the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall jointly
engage Aon Actuarial and Analytics (" _Aon_ ") or, if Aon is unable or
unwilling to serve or if the proposal provided by Aon to Buyer and Seller
specifying the scope of its obligations with respect to this _Section
2.3(j)_, the fees associated with such performance of services, and/or the
credentials of the team members to be engaged is unacceptable to Buyer or to
Seller, another international accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Seller
and Buyer (such firm, the " _Actuary Firm_ ") to perform the services set
forth in this _Section 2.3(j)_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, the Actuary Firm shall prepare and deliver to Buyer and Seller a
statement (in its draft form, the " _Actuary Adjustment Statement_ "),
setting forth the Pension Underfunding Liability as of the Closing Date
(specifying the amount of the Transferred U.S. Pension Accrued Benefits and
the Transferred U.S. Pension Assets used for such determination) and the U.S.
OPEB Transfer Amount, in each case as of the Closing Date, which Actuary
Adjustment Statement shall include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable
detail how such amounts were calculated. To the extent that the final Actuary
Adjustment Statement discloses a Pension and OPEB Purchase Price Adjustment,
then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
amount of such Pension and OPEB Purchase Price Adjustment. In connection with
the preparation and review of the Actuary Adjustment Statement, Buyer and
Seller shall promptly assist, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
assist, the Actuary Firm in its preparation of the Actuary Adjustment
Statement. The Actuary Adjustment Statement shall become final, conclusive
and binding upon the Parties on the forty-fifth (45th) day following receipt
thereof by Buyer and Seller unless Buyer or Seller gives written notice of
its disagreement (an " _Actuary Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the other Party
and the Actuary Firm prior to such date. Any Actuary Notice of
Disagreement shall specify (i) in reasonable detail the nature and amount of
any disagreement so asserted; and (ii) the amount that Buyer or Seller
reasonably believes is the correct Pension Underfunding Liability as of the
Closing Date and the U.S. OPEB Transfer Amount, as applicable, based on the
disagreements set forth in the Actuary Notice of Disagreement, including a
reasonably detailed description of the adjustments applied to the Actuary
Adjustment Statement in calculating such amount. Such disagreements may
include (but are not limited to) (A) the actuarial assumptions or applicable
data used for the calculation of the Pension Underfunding Liability as of the
Closing Date and/or the U.S. OPEB Transfer Amount, (B) whether the calculation
of the Pension Underfunding Liability as of the Closing Date and/or the U.S.
OPEB Transfer Amount was prepared in accordance with this Agreement (including
Section 15 of _Exhibit H_ ), the requirements of applicable Law and any
issued guidance thereunder or professional standards applicable to the
Actuary Firm, and (C) mathematical errors in the Actuary Adjustment Statement.
Seller shall as soon as administratively practicable, furnish to Buyer such
information and data as Buyer may reasonably request in order for Buyer to
review the Actuary Firm's calculations and determinations, including without
limitation all supporting information and data underlying the data and
information provided by Seller to the Actuary Firm. If a timely Actuary Notice
of Disagreement is received by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, and the
Actuary Firm, then the Actuary Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance
with _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ below) shall become final and binding upon the
Parties on the earlier of (x) the date the Parties resolve any differences
they have with respect to any matter specified in the Actuary Notice of
Disagreement or (y) the date the Actuary Firm delivers the final Actuary
Adjustment Statement to the Parties (in accordance with the procedure set
forth in this _Section 2.3(j)_). During the thirty- (30) day period
immediately following the delivery of an Actuary Notice of Disagreement,
Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences they may have with respect to any matter specified in the Actuary
Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty- (30) day period, if not
resolved, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and resolution by the
Actuary Firm any and all matters that were included in the Actuary Notice of
Disagreement and remain in dispute, and the Actuary Firm shall make a final
determination of the values set forth on the Actuary Adjustment Statement (and
shall use such determination to prepare the final Actuary Adjustment
Statement), which determination shall be binding on the Parties; _provided_
,  _however_ , the scope of such determination by the Actuary Firm shall be
limited to those matters that remain in dispute and that were included in the
Actuary Notice of Disagreement (including any sub-matters subordinate to a
larger included matter) unless the Actuary Firm identifies and determines
that an error has been made with respect to any value, statement, or any other
aspect of the Actuary Adjustment Statement (including the worksheet
thereunder). The fees and expenses of the Actuary Firm of preparing the
initial Actuary Adjustment Statement and all subsequent work involved to
prepare the final Actuary Adjustment Statement shall be borne equally by

(k) No payment pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ need be made by
either Party until the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after the
determination of the final Price Adjustment Statement or the final Actuary
Adjustment Statement (as applicable, the " _Price Adjustment Due Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that on or before any applicable Price Adjustment
Due Date, Buyer or Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the other Party
(or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by such receiving
Party), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank
accounts that have been designated in writing at least two (2) Business Days
prior to such Price Adjustment Due Date by the Party receiving payment, cash
in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price adjustment
under _Section 2.3(h)_, _Section 2.3(i) _and _Section 2.3(j)_, as
applicable, if any.

  



  

Section 2.4   _Allocation of the Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the
determination of the final Price Adjustment Statement and the final Actuary
Adjustment Statement pursuant to _Section 2.3_, Buyer shall prepare an
allocation of the Purchase Price (and any other relevant amounts) among the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Equity Interests (and the assets of any
Transferred Company with respect to which an election is made pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code in accordance with _Section 10.10(c)_) as of
the Effective Time in accordance with the allocation instructions set forth
on _Exhibit G_ for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax
purposes, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, for non-U.S. Tax
purposes (the " _Allocation Statement_ ").

  



  

(b) If, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Allocation Statement, Seller notifies Buyer that Seller objects to the
allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall seek
in good faith to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days. In the event
that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30)
days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain, and cooperate in good faith with
a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be
mutually agreed by the Parties (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") to resolve
the disputed items. For the avoidance of doubt, _Exhibit G_ shall be binding
upon the Independent Accountant, and in no event shall the
Independent Accountant resolve any such dispute in contravention of the
instructions set forth on _Exhibit G_ in any respect. Upon resolution of the
disputed items, the allocation reflected in the Allocation Statement shall be
adjusted to reflect such resolution. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer and Seller in inverse
proportion as they may each prevail on matters resolved by the Independent
Accountant, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Independent Accountant at the time the determination of the Independent
Accountant is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. In the event
that Seller notifies Buyer that it accepts the Allocation Statement, or does
not notify Buyer of any objections to the Allocation Statement during such
thirty- (30) day period, Seller shall be considered to have accepted the
accuracy of the Allocation Statement delivered by Buyer. Any adjustments to
the Purchase Price shall be reflected in the Allocation Statement in a manner
consistent with applicable Tax Law and the allocation instructions of _Exhibit
G_ as mutually agreed by the Parties (it being understood that no Party will
unreasonably withhold, condition or delay such agreement).

(c) The Parties shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Allocation Statement (including IRS Form 8594), and no Party
shall take any position in any Tax forum that is inconsistent with the
Allocation Statement absent a determination (within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code) or the prior written consent of Seller or Buyer, as
applicable.

  



  

Section 2.5   _Withholding_.

  



  

(a) With respect to any withholding or deduction required pursuant
to U.S. federal, state or local Tax Law, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements such Taxes as it is required to deduct and
withhold pursuant to such Law. If Buyer believes that any withholding of Tax
is required with respect to any payment under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, then Buyer shall (i) give written notice to Seller describing the
basis for such withholding in reasonable detail at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, (ii) provide Seller with a
reasonable opportunity to provide any applicable certificate, form or
documentation that would reduce or eliminate the requirement to deduct and
withhold Tax with respect to such payment, and (iii) otherwise cooperate with
Seller and take such steps as such Seller may reasonably request to reduce or
eliminate such withholding obligation to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall

Article III 
 CLOSING

  



  

Section 3.1   _Closing_.

  



  

(a) The Closing shall take place remotely via the exchange of
documents and signatures by electronic mail and/or facsimile on the third
(3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted,
waiver by the Parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of all the conditions
set forth in _Article IV_ (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction (or, to
the extent permitted, waiver by the Parties entitled to the benefits thereof)
of such conditions) or at such other times and places as the Parties may
mutually agree; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all cases the Closing must
not occur on a day that is not a Business Day. The date on which the Closing
occurs is the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date_ "). All of the actions to be
taken and documents to be executed and delivered at the Closing shall be
deemed to be taken, executed and delivered simultaneously, and no such
action, execution or delivery shall be effective until all are complete,
except as specifically provided herein. The Closing shall be deemed to be
effective as to each jurisdiction in which the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Equity Interests are transferred to, and the Assumed Liabilities
are assumed by, Buyer or the applicable Buyer Assignee as of the Effective
Time.

  



  

(b)  

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the GIDC
Conditions are not satisfied at the same time that all the conditions of
_Article IV _have been satisfied or waived, then the India Transfer will not
occur on the Closing Date, but shall instead occur as set forth in this
_Section 3.1(b)_ (or upon the waiver thereof by Buyer and Seller) (the "
_Deferred Transfer_ "). The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the India Transfer occurs as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date (the date on which the closing of such transfer, the "
_India Deferred Closing Date_ ") in accordance with this _Section 3.1(b)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing Date shall not be delayed as a result
of the India Transfer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of the
Purchase Price paid at Closing shall be reduced by an amount equal to Twenty-
Five Million U.S. Dollars ($25,000,000) (the " _Deferred Transfer Holdback_
") until the India Deferred Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that, the
Deferred Transfer Holdback shall bear interest at the Interest Rate from the
Closing Date until the date the Deferred Transfer Holdback is actually
received by Seller, and Huntsman International (India) Private Limited shall
be entitled to the Deferred Transfer Holdback and all interest accrued
thereon on the India Deferred Closing Date. At or prior to the closing of the
India Transfer, Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and the
Buyer Assignees, on the other, shall execute and deliver the Business Transfer
Documents pertaining to the India Transfer in accordance with _Section
2.1(e)_. Notwithstanding that the Business in India will not be
transferred to Buyer on the Closing Date, all of the provisions of this
Agreement, including relating to calculation of Net Working Capital, Net
Indebtedness, the Purchase Price adjustments and the indemnification
provisions, shall apply to the Parties as though such transfer occurred at
the Closing, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this
_Section 3.1(b)_. The Parties agree that the Transition Services Agreement to
be executed on the Closing Date will include services and fees pertaining to
the India operations, but notwithstanding the inclusion of such services and
fees in the Transition Services Agreement on the Closing Date, no services
shall be provided thereunder and no fees shall be paid thereunder with respect
to the India operations prior to the India Deferred Closing Date, but shall
instead commence on the India Deferred Closing Date. Neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever,
whether express or implied, at Law or in equity, with respect to the India
operations, other than as set forth in _Article V_ of this Agreement and then
only as of the date of this Agreement, the Closing Date and the India
Deferred Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(ii) From and after the Closing, and until the India Deferred
Closing Date, the India operations (including all Cash Equivalents generated
with respect thereto from and after the Closing) will be held for Buyer's or
the applicable Buyer Assignee's benefit and account and will be managed and
operated by Seller and its Affiliates for Buyer's (or its designated
Affiliate's) benefit and account.

  



  

(iii) Except as otherwise contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ , during
the period from (but not including) the Closing Date through (and
including) the India Deferred Closing Date (the " _Interim Period_ "): (A)
the India operations will be operated in the Ordinary Course or, unless
prohibited by applicable Law, otherwise in such manner as Buyer shall
reasonably request, (B) notwithstanding _Section 11.1(d)_ Seller's pre-
Closing obligations pursuant to _Section 7.2 _will continue in force with
respect to the India operations, until India Deferred Closing Date occurs (and
all references to Closing Date therein shall include the India Deferred
Closing Date), and (C) no distributions or dividends (whether in
cash, securities, property or other assets) shall be made by Huntsman
International (India) Private Limited to its shareholders. Buyer and Seller
will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any Liability for Taxes with respect to the
deferral of the India Transfer.

  



  

(iv) Seller and its Affiliates will have no Liability to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates arising out of the management or operation of the India
operations other than for Losses arising out of breach of pre-Closing
obligations, gross negligence or willful misconduct, for which Losses Seller
will indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
and its Affiliates will have no Liability for actions taken in accordance
with the request or at the direction of Buyer or its Affiliates.

  



  

(v)  The India Deferred Closing will be effected on the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the GIDC Conditions have been satisfied (or upon the
waiver thereof by Buyer and Seller), or at such other time as the Parties may
agree. In the event that the India Deferred Closing Date does not occur prior
to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the sole
discretion to either cancel the India Transfer (in which case Seller shall
forfeit its right to the Deferred Transfer Holdback) or extend the time
period for India Transfer (at its sole discretion).

  



  

   

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(vi)  With respect to each Employee who is primarily based within the
India operations as of the Closing Date (a " _Deferred Employee_ "), (A) the
India Deferred Closing Date shall be deemed to be the Closing Date for all
purposes of _Article IX_ and _Exhibit H_ of this Agreement and (B) any
rights or obligations of the parties with respect to the Deferred
Employees pursuant to _Article IX_ and _Exhibit H_ of this Agreement that
are said to be effective as of the Closing, the Closing Date or the Effective
Time shall be deemed to be effective as of the India Deferred Closing Date.
Seller shall update Schedule 1 of _Exhibit H_ periodically during the Interim
Period to reflect any additional Deferred Employees, new hires,
transfers, retirements, resignations, dismissals and other employment
terminations with respect to Deferred Employees that may have occurred at any
time during the Interim Period. The Parties acknowledge that certain
Transferred Employees (other than the Deferred Employees) have roles and
responsibilities pertaining to the India operations, and agree that such
Transferred Employees may continue to have such roles and responsibilities
(including with respect to Deferred Employees) during the Interim Period and
Seller and Huntsman International (India) Private Limited shall facilitate
such discharge of roles and responsibilities.

  



  

(vii)  For purposes of _Section 2.1(f)_, _Section 7.1_, _Section
7.2_, _Section 7.3_, _Section 7.6_,  _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_,
Section 2(b) of _Exhibit H_ , Section 3 of _Exhibit H_ , and Section 4 of
_Exhibit H_ , to the extent applicable to India operations, all references to
the Closing Date or the Effective Time shall be deemed to be references to
the India Deferred Closing Date.

  



  

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Tax Laws, Seller and
Buyer agree to treat and report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to
treat and report, on their Tax Returns, the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Equity Interests that are subject to the provisions of this
_Section 3.1 _as assets owned by Buyer or its applicable Affiliates as of
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax items related to the
assets treated as owned by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as attributable to a Post-
Closing Tax Period.

shall not be deemed to be breached as a result of any action that any of the
Seller Affiliates is required or permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement
of the Ancillary Agreements, or for which Buyer has provided its consent. In
the event this representation and warranty is breached because any Seller
Affiliate has in good faith failed to identify and transfer any assets
exclusively related to the Business, such breach shall be deemed cured if such
Seller Affiliate promptly transfers such assets to Buyer (or otherwise
transfers the benefits and burdens of such assets), unless otherwise provided
for in this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, at no additional cost or

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 6.2   _Authority; Binding Effect_ _._

binding obligation of Buyer and Buyer Guarantor, enforceable against each of
Buyer and Buyer Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equity
principles. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
the Ancillary Agreements by each Seller Affiliate party thereto, as the case
may be, each Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer or a Buyer Assignee is a
party, when delivered hereunder, will be duly and validly executed and
delivered and will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer
or the relevant Buyer Assignee (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance
with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general equity principles.

  



  

Section 6.3   _Non-Contravention_ _._

  



  

The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer and Buyer Guarantor of this

their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder do not and will not
require any filing with, or clearance, consent or approval of, any

this Agreement and the Acquisition.

  



  

(b) Neither Buyer nor Buyer Guarantor is in violation of any Laws or
Orders applicable to the conduct of its business, except for violations the
existence of which would not reasonably be expected to impair or delay the

otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 7.1   _Access, Information and Documents_ _._

  



  

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, upon
reasonable advance notice from Buyer of not less than five (5) Business Days,
Seller shall, and shall cause the other Seller Affiliates to, to the extent
permitted by Law, permit Buyer and its authorized Representatives to have
reasonable access, during regular business hours, to the assets, key
Employees, personnel familiar with the Insurance Policies, facilities
(including to surveyors for the purpose of conducting real property surveys)
(subject to compliance with Seller's safety rules), Contracts, books and
records and other documents and data to the extent related to the
Business (other than the Excluded Assets); _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such access (or related activities or investigations) shall unreasonably
interfere with Seller's or any Seller Affiliates' normal operation of their
respective businesses, including the Business, or include any environmental
or other intrusive or subsurface sampling, testing, investigation or
analysis (including of soil, water, air or building materials at or relating
to the Business Real Property, the Transferred Tangible Personal Property or
the tangible personal property of any Transferred Company); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that all information received by Buyer or its Representatives and
given by or on behalf of any Seller Affiliate in connection with this
Agreement and the Acquisition prior to the Closing will be held by Buyer and
its Affiliates and its and their Representatives as Evaluation Material (as

Confidentiality Agreements. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreements are
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect (and all obligations thereunder shall be binding upon Buyer and
its Representatives as if parties thereto) until the Closing, at which time
the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer's obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate only in respect of that portion of
the Evaluation Material related to the Business or relating to
the Transferred Companies, and for all other Evaluation Material the
Confidentiality Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. If for any reason the Closing does not occur, the
Confidentiality Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of a
conflict between the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements and the
confidentiality terms contained in any Ancillary Agreement that provides that

that is more protective of such Confidential Information or for a longer
period of time than provided for in the Confidentiality Agreements, the terms
provided in the Ancillary Agreement shall govern.

  



  

   

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Following the Closing, each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that in the course of this Agreement, it will be necessary for, and
inevitable that, each Party to acquire information which could include, in
whole or in part, information concerning the sales, products, services,
employees, customers and prospective customers, sources of supply, computer
programs, system documentation, sales projections, software development,
manuals, formulae, processes, methods, machines, compositions, ideas,
improvements, inventions or other confidential or proprietary information
belonging to another Party or relating to the affairs of another Party,
including the Business and the Retained Business, as applicable
(collectively, the " _Confidential Information_ "). Each Party (together with
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, a " _Receiving Party_ "
for purposes of this _Section 7.1(b)_) agrees to hold and safeguard the
Confidential Information in trust for the Party disclosing the Confidential
Information (a " _Disclosing Party_ ") and its successors and assigns and
only use the Confidential Information for purposes of performing its
obligations and enforcing its rights under this Agreement and agrees that it
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party,
misappropriate or disclose or make available to anyone for use outside of the
Disclosing Party at any time, either during the term hereof or subsequent
thereto, any of the Confidential Information, whether or not developed by the
Receiving Party, except as required in the performance of the
Receiving Party's duties or enforcement of its rights hereunder or as
required by applicable Law. If the Receiving Party is required by or under
applicable Law or a court or administrative order to disclose any of the
Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (x) promptly notify the
Disclosing Party of the existence of such request or demand and the disclosure
that is expected to be made in respect thereto, in each case with sufficient
specificity so that the Disclosing Party may, at its expense, seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 7.1(b)_ and (y) if requested by the Disclosing
Party, assist the Disclosing Party, at its expense, in seeking a protective
order or other appropriate remedy in respect of such request or demand. If
the Receiving Party is legally compelled, upon the advice of legal counsel, to
disclose Confidential Information without first notifying the Disclosing
Party in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Receiving Party shall
disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that the Receiving
Party is legally required to disclose upon the advice of the Receiving
Party's legal counsel, _provided_ that the Receiving Party exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information, including by obtaining reasonable assurances that
confidential treatment shall be accorded any Confidential Information so
disclosed. A Receiving Party shall inform any and all of its Representatives
that receive Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party of the
confidential and proprietary nature of such Confidential Information and
shall direct such Representatives to treat such Confidential Information in
accordance with this _Section 7.1(b)_. Except to the extent otherwise
specifically provided in this _Section 7.1(b)_, the Confidential Information
will be kept confidential by each Receiving Party and its Representatives, and
the applicable Receiving Party shall be responsible for the breach of this
_Section 7.1(b)_, by any of its Representatives. In the event of a conflict
between the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement and the
confidentiality terms contained in any Ancillary Agreement that provides that
certain Confidential Information shall be maintained confidential on a basis
that is more protective of such Confidential Information or for a longer
period of time than provided for in this Agreement, the terms provided in the
Ancillary Agreement shall govern.

  



  

(c) The representation in _Section 5.16(e)_ and covenants in
_Section 7.1(a)_ and _Section 7.1(b)_ will not require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to provide Buyer or its Representatives with access to any
document, communication or information (i) not related to the Acquisition,
the sale process with respect to the Business or the possible sale of the
Business, (ii) that Seller believes in good faith may be subject to any
contractual confidentiality obligation or should not be disclosed due to its
competitively sensitive nature, (iii) that may be covered by any attorney-
client work product or similar privilege, (iv) that constitutes any
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, except to the extent pertaining to a Transferred Company, or (v)
if Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such
information is reasonably pertinent thereto.

be subject to any liability or cost on account of the failure to obtain any
such Environmental Permit.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.3(b)_,
in the event that any Governmental Authority does not issue directly to any

Section 7.4   _Certain Governmental Matters_ _._

  



  

(a) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)_ or this _Section 7.4_, Buyer and Seller agree to take or
cause to be taken the following actions: (i) provide promptly to any
Governmental Authority with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable Competition Laws (" _Governmental Competition Authority_
") information and documents requested by such Governmental Competition
Authority, or necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the
Acquisition and (ii) without in any way limiting the other provisions of this
_Section 7.4_, file any Notification and Report form pursuant to the HSR Act
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless filed

Governmental Authority in order to obtain any Required Approval or under any
Competition Law in connection with the Acquisition within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and thereafter comply as soon
as reasonably practicable and advisable with any requests for additional
information or documentary material that may be made under such Competition
Law.

  



  

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall (i) keep each other apprised of
the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any Governmental Competition Authority, and shall
comply with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable (including
a request for additional information or documentary material pursuant to the
HSR Act), (ii) cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
making of all filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant
to this _Section 7.4_, including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, by permitting counsel for the other Party to review
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental

being provided to the other Party as necessary to (x) comply with contractual
arrangements or (y) address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns
and (iv) furnish to the other Party such information and assistance as such
Party reasonably may request in connection with the preparation of any
submissions to, or agency proceedings by, any Governmental Competition
Authority. Upon and subject to the terms of this _Section 7.4_, each Party
agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist in any
defense by any other Party to the Acquisition before any Governmental
Competition Authority reviewing the Acquisition, including by providing as
promptly as practicable such information as may be requested by such

(c) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary or advisable or as may be required by any Governmental Authority to
expeditiously (and in any event, prior to the End Date) avoid and eliminate
each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law, so as to
enable the consummation of the Acquisition as soon as practicable, and in any
event prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
directly or indirectly required to litigate or participate in the litigation
of any action, whether juridical or administrative, brought by any
Governmental Authority challenging or seeking to restrain, prohibit, or place
conditions on the consummation of the Acquisitions under any Competition Law.
For purposes of this _Section 7.4(c)_ and _Section 7.7_, Buyer's reasonable
best efforts shall include taking, or causing to be taken, all actions
necessary or advisable or as may be required by any Governmental Authority to
enable the consummation of the Acquisition prior to the End Date, including
actions to sell, license or divest, or to hold separate and agree to sell,
license or divest, but only with respect to entities, assets, or facilities
of the Business that are physically located within the United States ("
_Remedy Actions_ "); notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be
required to take Remedy Actions (for purposes of this _Section 7.4(c)_ and
_Section 7.7_, collectively) that, when taken together with, on an
integrated and aggregate basis, with all other associated business lines
of the Business, would require the sale, divestiture or loss of businesses or
assets that generated EBITDA in excess of Ten Million U.S. Dollars
($10,000,000) during the trailing twelve (12) months. For sake of clarity,
Buyer shall not be obliged to sell, license or divest any entities, assets or
facilities of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries (before taking effect of the
Acquisition). For purposes of this _Section 7.4(c)_ and _Section 7.7_,
"EBITDA" means EBITDA as calculated in a manner consistent with the
methodology utilized in the earnings releases Seller has publicly filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Seller and Buyer shall not
extend, directly or indirectly, any Competition Law waiting period or enter
into any agreement with a Governmental Competition Authority to delay or not
to consummate the Acquisition on the Closing Date, except with the
prior written consent of the other Party to this Agreement. Seller and Buyer
shall not have any substantive contact with any Governmental Competition
Authority in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by this _Section
7.4_ unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Competition Authority, gives the other Party
the opportunity to participate.

  



  

(d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause each of the Buyer Assignees and their respective
Affiliates not to, operate its business in such manner or take any action, or
refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would be to delay or
impede the ability of the Parties to consummate the Acquisition or increase
the risk of not obtaining the consent or clearance of a Governmental
Competition Authority or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and their respective ultimate
parent entities and subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by
merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any Person or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or
equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental
Competition Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period; (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Competition Authority
seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) delay or
prevent the consummation of the Acquisition.

the right to control or direct the Business's operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Seller
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Buyer's or its
subsidiaries' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

Section 7.6   _Guarantees; Other Obligations_ _._

obligations to replace the outstanding Seller Guarantees listed on _Schedule
7.6_ or (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms thereof,
assume all obligations (solely to the extent Related to the Business) under
each Seller Guarantee, and obtain from the creditor, beneficiary or other
counterparty a full release (in a form satisfactory to Seller) of all parties
liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or
fulfillment of other obligations to a beneficiary or counterparty in
connection with amounts drawn under the Seller Guarantees (solely to the
extent Related to the Business). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Seller shall have the right to control and direct the process by
which the Parties approach the beneficiaries or counterparties of such Seller
Guarantees, including by taking the lead in all meetings, discussions and
communications with beneficiaries or counterparties. To the extent the
beneficiary or counterparty under any Seller Guarantees does not accept
any such substitute letter of credit, Buyer guarantee or other obligation
proffered by Buyer and Buyer is not permitted to assume or cause to be
assumed any such Seller Guarantee in accordance with the foregoing clause (b),
Buyer shall (x) indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
Subsidiaries against, and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for, all amounts
paid, including costs or expenses in connection with such Seller Guarantees,
including Seller's and its Affiliates' expenses in maintaining such Seller
Guarantees, whether or not any such Seller Guarantee is drawn upon or required
to be performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates to the extent any Seller Guarantee is called upon and Seller or any
of its Affiliates makes any payment or is obligated to reimburse the party
issuing the Seller Guarantee and (y) not without Seller's prior written
consent, amend in any manner adverse to Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
extend (or permit the extension of), any Seller Guarantee or any obligation
supported by any Seller Guarantee.

causing to be taken, all actions necessary or advisable or as may be required
by any Governmental Authority to enable the consummation of the Acquisition

(30) days after the initial discussion for the Day 1 Transition Plan occurs
but in no event later than by the date which is fifty (50) calendar days
after the date hereof (a " _Transition Plan Issue_ ") and/or the final to-be-
executed form of the Transition Services Agreement by within thirty (30) days
after the Day 1 Transition Plan is agreed but in no event later than by the
date which is eighty (80) calendar days after the date hereof (a " _TSA Issue_

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The arbitration will be decided by a sole arbitrator, whom shall
be selected by ballot based on the following procedure immediately after the
date hereof in order to prepare for any potential dispute. Within fifteen (15)
days after the date hereof, each Party shall submit to the other Party a list
of five former federal judges they propose to serve as the sole arbitrator
in the event of a dispute, after confirming their availability to serve as
arbitrator. Within seven (7) days of receiving the list of three proposed
arbitrators, each Party may strike two of the arbitrators on the list. Within
seven (7) days after the Parties strike the arbitrators from the list, the
Parties shall rank the arbitrators not been stricken from the list from 1 to
6, with the number 6 assigned to the Party's top choice arbitrator and the
number 1 assigned to the Party's last choice arbitrator, and shall
communicate this ranking to the other Party. The candidate with the greatest
total number of points assigned by the Parties shall be designated as the
sole arbitrator. In case of a tie, Seller shall select between the two top-
ranked arbitrators. The Parties shall confirm the selection of the sole
arbitrator, and shall request that the selected sole arbitrator confirm to the
Parties if any conflict arises that prevents him or her from serving as
arbitrator in the event of a dispute. In the event that a conflict prevents
him or her from serving as arbitrator, the Parties shall redo the ballot
process.

  



  

(c) The sole issue or issues to be decided in such arbitration will
be the Transition Plan Issue and/or the TSA Issue, as the case may be,
consisting of those terms or conditions of the Day 1 Transition Plan and/or
Transition Services Agreement that remain subject to disagreement between the
Parties. The arbitrator will not have the authority to resolve any other
disputes arising under this Agreement unless the Parties expressly agree
otherwise in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement and unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, such
arbitration shall be the sole binding mechanism for resolving a
Transition Plan Issue and/or a TSA Issue that is not voluntarily resolved by
the Parties.

  



  

(d) Unless the Parties agree in writing to additional and specific
pre-hearing discovery, the only pre-hearing arbitration discovery will be (i)
reasonably limited production of relevant and non-privileged documents and
(ii) the identification of witnesses to be called at the arbitration hearing,
which identification must give the witness's name, general qualifications, and
position, and a brief statement as to the general scope of the testimony to
be given by the witness, with both activities described in _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ to be completed seven (7) Business Days prior to the date on which the
hearing is set to begin.

  



  

(e) With respect to a Transition Plan Issue and/or a TSA Issue, the
Parties will engage in "baseball" arbitration whereby each Party will submit
its proposed provision(s) addressing each of the remaining terms or conditions
of the Day 1 Transition Plan and/or Transition Services Agreement that remain
subject to disagreement between the Parties, to the arbitrator and the
arbitrator will be instructed to select the proposed provision that, in the
arbitrator's judgment, most closely effectuates, to the maximum extent
possible, both Parties' intent as reflected in: (i) with respect to the Day 1
Transition Plan, _Annex E_ and the goal of ensuring Day 1 IT Readiness
(which may include making a determination as to information technology
applications and services that are critical to the Business in respect of
ensuring Day 1 IT Readiness) and (ii) with respect to the Transition Services
Agreement, Schedule B to the Transition Services Agreement (e.g., the
allocation of costs and pricing methodology set forth therein).

  



  

   

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) The arbitration hearing shall be concluded no later than fifteen
(15) Business Days from the date of the notice and the demand for
arbitration. The arbitrator shall enter a final decision no more than ten (10)
Business Days following the completion of the arbitration hearing. The
arbitrator shall serve copies of the final decision on Seller and Buyer by
overnight delivery, facsimile, and by email, but service will be sufficient
if service is made by overnight delivery. The final decision of the
arbitrator will be final and binding on both Parties.

  



  

(g) Each Party will bear its own attorneys' and expert witness fees
and both Parties will share equally in the payment of the arbitrator's fees
as and when billed by the arbitrator.

Taxes for which the other Party would be liable under _Section 10.1_ (a "

Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the principles of _Section
10.6_, taking into account the type of Tax to which such refund, credit or

including, without limitation, the joint execution of necessary copies of IRS
Form 8023 and all attachments required to be filed therewith pursuant to

entitled to indemnity for or in respect of any Taxes (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, under _Section 10.1(a)_) (A) imposed with respect to
Post-Closing Tax Periods (except to the extent resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.19(j)_), (B) that are

(d) _No Prejudice_. Subject to _Section 11.6(e)_, the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller and Buyer,
and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties

claims under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ exceed such remaining portion of the
Retention Escrow Amount then held in the Retention Escrow Account, any such

(d) The Retention Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive
source of payment for any and all claims for indemnification under _Section
11.2(a)(i)_, and accordingly, no Buyer Indemnitee shall seek recourse against
any other assets of Seller for any such claim.

  



  

(e) Subject to the provisions of the Retention Escrow Agreement,

collect from the Retention Escrow Account the amount of any Losses payable to

Section 11.8   _Claims_ _._

  



  

Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it may be entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.1(a)_ or this _Article XI_ (the "

(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of any pending or threatened claim, demand or
circumstance that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement (a " _Claim_ ") (including a pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ")). Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim, such facts
and information as are then reasonably available, including the estimated
amount of Losses and the specific basis for indemnification hereunder. Failure
to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying
Party's obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

Section 11.9   _Defense of Actions_ _._

  



  

(a) The Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party, at
the Indemnifying Party's option and expense, to assume the complete defense
of any Third Party Claim with full authority to conduct such defense and to
settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the Indemnified Party will fully
cooperate in such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such Third Party Claim, except
with the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to the entry of any
Order or enter into any settlement (a) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages and/or (b) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof. After
notice to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's election to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to the Indemnified Party only for such legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof at the written request of the Indemnifying Party. As to those Third
Party Claims with respect to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the
Indemnifying Party an opportunity to participate in such defense, at its cost
and expense, and will consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to settling
or otherwise disposing of any of the same. The Indemnified Party will not
settle any Third Party Claim without the prior consent of the Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and, upon the
Indemnifying Party's request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually convenient
basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Applicable Tax
Contest shall be governed by _Article X_ to the extent inconsistent with
this _Section 11.9_.

  



  

   

 | 96| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Prior to assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying
Party shall (i) acknowledge that it would have an indemnity obligation for
any Loss resulting from such Third Party Claim as provided under this _Article
XI_ and (ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with reasonable evidence that the
Indemnifying Party has adequate resources to defend the Third Party Claim and
to fulfill its indemnity obligations hereunder (taking into account any other
pending claims and the funds remaining with the Retention Escrow Agent). The
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or control the defense of
any Third Party Claim, and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith, if (A) the
Indemnifying Party does not deliver the acknowledgement and furnish the
evidence described in the immediately preceding sentence within twenty (20)
days of receipt of notice of the claim pursuant hereto; (B) the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the claim
would be materially detrimental to the reputation or future business prospects
of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; (C) the claim relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation or seeks injunctive or equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; or (D) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend vigorously the claim.

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and
expenses of such separate counsel with respect to the Third Party Claim shall
be paid by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
(i) incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of the Third Party Claim
and (ii) if representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if counsel for the Indemnified Party reasonably determines
that there is a conflict between the positions of the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party in conducting the defense of such action or that there
are legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party different from or in
addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, then counsel for the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, if the Indemnified Party so elects, to
conduct the defense to the extent reasonably determined by such counsel to
protect the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate
local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party
Claim.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third
Party Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request and at the Indemnifying Party's
expense) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of books and records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and
reasonable access to the personnel of Buyer and its subsidiaries and in the
case of cooperation by Seller Indemnitees, Seller, in each case at mutually
convenient times so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the business of Buyer and its subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the Indemnified Party's consent
prior to entering into any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third
Party Claim unless such settlement, compromise or discharge (i) by its terms
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim (either directly or through the
release of then-remaining funds from the Retention Escrow Account
sufficient to satisfy such liability), (ii) expressly and unconditionally
releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third Party
Claim, (iii) does not impose any injunctive or other equitable relief on the
Indemnified Party, and (iv) does not include any admission or finding of any
violation of Law by or otherwise expressly disparage the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(f) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against
any Indemnifying Party under _Section 11.2_ and  _Section 11.3_ that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party.
Subject to  _Section 11.4_ and _Section 11.5_, the failure by any
Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Party under _Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.3_, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

Section 11.10   _Limitation, Exclusivity_ _._

  



  

(a) No Claim with respect to a covenant shall be made or have any
validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given written notice of such
Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the date set forth in _Section 11.1_
for such covenant to expire. Other than (i) any dispute under _Section 2.3_
that is required to be decided by the Accounting Firm, (ii) regarding Fraud
and injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance) if the
Closing occurs and (iii) as expressly provided herein or in any Ancillary
Agreement, this _Article XI_ provides the exclusive means from and after the
Closing by which a party may assert and remedy any and all claims (including
any claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct
(including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute, strict liability or otherwise), and _Section 13.10_ provides the
exclusive means by which a party may bring actions, in each case, against the
other party (or any of its Affiliates) under or with respect to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
or therein from and after the Closing. Except for Fraud or injunctive and
provisional relief (including specific performance) if the Closing occurs and
except as expressly provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
each party hereby waives and releases any other remedies or claims that it
may have against the other party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to
the matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or an
Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or therein or
relating to the Transferred Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Transferred
Equity Interests, the Transferred Companies, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Excluded Liabilities (including, _inter alia_ , any rights of contribution or
recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., or other Environmental Law). With
respect to any Losses or other Liabilities arising under this Agreement,
Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such Losses and Liabilities from Seller,
and Buyer hereby waives the right to seek Losses or other Liabilities from or
equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, against any Affiliate of
Seller or any director, officer, employee, Representatives, stockholders,
members, successors and permitted assignees (or any of its Affiliates). If an
Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any Third Party Claim, then the appropriate Indemnifying
Party will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party
against such third party, and such Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all such rights and
remedies against such third party. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parties hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they
may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, (i) Seller shall
have no liability for any Loss under _Section 11.2_ relating to any
Environmental Liability or any obligation to conduct or fund any assessment,
investigation, cleanup, removal, remediation, corrective action, response or
monitoring (collectively, any " _Environmental Loss_ ") if the cost,
obligation, event, circumstance or condition that gave rise to such
Environmental Loss (A) is the result of any reporting or disclosure to any
Governmental Authority, or was discovered as a result of any environmental or
other intrusive or subsurface sampling, testing, investigation or analysis
conducted, after the Closing Date, except to the extent any such reporting,
disclosure, sampling, testing, investigation or analysis was required by
Environmental Law pre-Closing or required to respond to an unsolicited and
enforceable request, claim or demand by a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction; (B) is the result of a site or facility closure, cessation of
all or a portion of the operations at any location or material change in use
of any Business Real Property after the Closing; (C) arises out of or results
from the repeal of, amendment to, or other change in any Environmental Law or
Governmental Authorization issued thereunder in effect as of the Closing Date
or the enactment or new interpretation of any Environmental Law after the
Closing Date; (D) to the extent the cost of such Environmental Loss is
increased, or the scope or extent of such Environmental Loss is exacerbated,
due to a post-Closing act or omission by a Person other than Seller, its
affiliates, agents, contractors or subcontractors, unless such act or
omission was required by any Governmental Authority; or (E) relates to the
removal or abatement of asbestos or asbestos-containing materials located on
or in structural components of the Business Real Property, the Transferred
Tangible Personal Property or the tangible personal property of any
Transferred Company and (ii) Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to direct and control all discussions, negotiations and
Proceedings with or before Governmental Authorities or third parties, and to
conduct and control any assessment, investigation, cleanup, removal,
remediation, corrective action, response or monitoring with respect to any
Environmental Loss that is subject to indemnification under _Section
11.2_, including the right, after notice to and consultation with Buyer, to
settle or otherwise resolve any matter giving rise to or forming part of such
Environmental Loss, including the placement of engineering or institutional
controls, such as use or deed restrictions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller may not enter into any such settlement or resolution that would
reasonably be expected to unreasonably interfere with Buyer's operation of
the Business or the subject property without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent will not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Buyer may, at its cost and expense, participate in all
discussions, negotiations or Proceedings with or before Governmental
Authorities or third parties with respect to any such Environmental Loss.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Buyer hereby grants to Seller and
its consultants an irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully paid-up license to
enter upon, access and use the Business Real Property, the Transferred
Tangible Personal Property and the tangible personal property of any
Transferred Company in order to meet its obligations with respect to any
Environmental Loss that is subject to indemnification under _Section 11.2_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall conduct any assessment,
investigation, cleanup, removal, remediation, corrective action, response or
monitoring in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations or conduct of the Business, unless such assessment, investigation,
cleanup, removal, remediation, corrective action, response or monitoring is
mandated by a Governmental Authority. With respect to any Environmental Loss
that is subject to indemnification under _Section 11.2_, Seller shall have no
liability or obligation to conduct any assessment, investigation, cleanup,
removal, remediation, corrective action, response or monitoring, except to the
extent such assessment, investigation, cleanup, removal, remediation,
corrective action, response or monitoring is reasonably necessary to attain
compliance with Environmental Laws and incorporates (i) the least stringent
cleanup standards that, based upon the use classification (industrial,
commercial or residential) of the subject Business Real Property, as of the
Closing Date, are allowed under applicable Environmental Law and (ii) the
least costly methods that are allowed under applicable Environmental Law
to achieve such standards, including the use of engineering and institutional
controls; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller's use of engineering and
institutional controls does not unreasonably interfere with Buyer's ownership
or operation of the Business or the Transferred Assets without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent will not unreasonably be
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 11.11   _Calculation of Damages_ _._

  



  

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in
this Agreement: (i) each such obligation shall be reduced by any net Tax
benefit (A) actually realized by the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Tax
Party as a result of the incurrence or payment of the Losses or Indemnified
Taxes giving rise to such obligation,\\\ and (B) used by such Indemnified
Party or Indemnified Tax Party to actually reduce the amount of Taxes
otherwise payable (or increase the amount of Tax refunds received) by it in
the taxable period in which such indemnification obligation is paid, any of
the previous taxable periods or any of the succeeding taxable periods, (ii)
all Losses shall be net of any amounts that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification
agreement with, any third party or any insurance policy or other cash receipts
or sources of reimbursement in respect of such Loss ( _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing herein shall obligate any Indemnified Party to seek
recovery of any such insurance proceeds (other than under the RandW Insurance
Policy) or pursue any such third party recoveries, other than in respect of
the obligations set forth in _Section 11.6(a)_), (iii) all Losses will be
determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any reserve with respect
to such matter on the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules or the final Price Adjustment Statement and (iv) Seller shall not
be liable for any Losses to the extent that such Losses suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee (A) result from any act or omission by such Buyer Indemnitee, (B)
result from the failure of such Buyer Indemnitee to take reasonable action to
mitigate such Losses, (C) are taken into account in the calculation of Net
Working Capital, (D) result from the operation of the Transferred Companies
or the Business, or any event or occurrence, after the Closing or (E) are
caused by or result from any action (1) that Seller is required, permitted or
requested to take pursuant to _Section 7.2_ (including pursuant to the
consent of Buyer) or (2) for which Buyer has provided its consent (including
pursuant to _Section 7.2_) or (3) that Seller having sought Buyer's consent
pursuant to _Section 7.2_, did not take as a result of Buyer
having unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed the requested consent.
In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, each Indemnified Party and
Indemnified Tax Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss or Indemnified Taxes, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Tax benefit shall be determined based upon the
applicable Tax Returns with and without the effect of such indemnified Loss
or Indemnified Taxes and related indemnification payment. If at the time an
indemnification payment is due a Tax benefit has not actually been realized
by the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Tax Party (as applicable), the
indemnification payment shall be computed and paid without such Tax benefit
and the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Tax Party (as applicable) shall pay
to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax benefit as actually realized
within five (5) Business Days after such realization.

  



  

   

 | 100| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If any Buyer Indemnitee is at any time entitled (whether by
reason of a contractual right, a right to take or bring a
Proceeding, availability of insurance, or a right to require a payment
discount or otherwise) to recover from another Person any amount in respect
of any matter giving rise to a Loss (whether before or after Seller has made a
payment to any Buyer Indemnitee hereunder and in respect thereof), Buyer
shall (and shall cause its applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) and Representatives to) (a) promptly notify Seller and provide
such information as Seller may require relating to such right of recovery and
the steps taken or to be taken by Buyer in connection therewith, (b) if so
required by Seller (subject to Buyer being indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction by Seller against all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer in respect thereof) and before being entitled to recover
any amount from Seller under this Agreement, first take all steps (whether by
making a claim against its insurers, commencement of a Proceeding or
otherwise) as Seller may reasonably require to pursue such recovery and (c)
keep Seller fully informed of the progress of any action taken in respect
thereof. Thereafter, any claim against Seller shall be limited (in addition
to the other limitations on Seller's liability referred to in this Agreement)
to the amount by which the Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnitee exceed the
amounts so recovered by the Buyer Indemnitee or any such Affiliate. If an
indemnification payment is received by an Indemnified Party from an
Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party later receives insurance
proceeds (other than proceeds received under the RandW Insurance Policy) or
other third-party recoveries in respect of the related Losses, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to
the lesser of (a) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds or other
third-party recoveries, less any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with securing or obtaining such amount from the third
party and increase in future premiums as a result of such claim, or (b) the
actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses. If an Indemnifying
Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or incurred by an Indemnified
Party pursuant to the provisions of this _Article XI_, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and
remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims
of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses and with respect to the
claim giving rise to such Losses.

(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the date hereof (the " _End Date_ "), or such later date as
the Parties may agree upon in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to the Party seeking to terminate if any action or failure of such
Party (or in the case of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor or a Buyer Assignee) in breach
of this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Closing has
been the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
End Date; or

  



  

(ii) any Legal Restraint preventing the consummation of the
Acquisition shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
12.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a Party if the issuance of such final,
non-appealable Legal Restraint was primarily due to a failure by such Party
(or, in the case of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor or a Buyer Assignee) to perform
any of its obligations in breach of this Agreement, including pursuant to
_Section 7.3_;

  



  

(c) by Seller if:

  



  

(i) (A) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 4.3_ shall have

Section 12.2   _Effect of Termination_ _._

  



  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 12.1_, all obligations
of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate and it will become void
and of no further force or effect, except that the obligations in _Section
7.1(a)_ with respect to confidentiality,  _Article I_, _Section 12.1_, this
_Section 12.2_, and _Article XIII_ will survive; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
in each case subject to _Section 2.2(a)_, that if this Agreement is
terminated by a Party because of the breach of this Agreement by another
Party (including, in the case of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor or a Buyer Assignee)
of any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, or
because one or more of the conditions to the terminating Party's (including,
in the case of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor or a Buyer Assignee) obligations under
this Agreement are not satisfied as a result of the other Party's failure to
comply with its covenant or obligations contained in this Agreement, then the
terminating Party's (including, in the case of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor or a
Buyer Assignee) right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies will survive
such termination unimpaired and nothing in this _Section 12.2_ shall be
deemed to release any Party (including, in the case of Buyer, Buyer Guarantor
or a Buyer Assignee) from any liability for any breach by such Party of the
terms, conditions, covenants and other obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreements shall survive and remain in full force and effect until separately
terminable pursuant to its term. Nothing herein shall limit or prevent any
Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under _Section
13.16_.

  



  

Section 12.3   _Notice of Termination_ _._

  



  

Either Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_

Section 13.2   _Amendment; Waiver_ _._

  



  

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by duly authorized officers of Buyer and Seller (subject to
_Section 13.5_) or, in the case of a waiver, by a duly authorized officer of

except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any purported
amendment by any Party or Parties effected in a manner which does not
comply with this _Section 13.2_ shall be null and void. No failure or delay

preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

Section 13.3   _Assignment_ _._

  



  

No Party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement, including by sale of stock or by operation of Law in
connection with a merger or sale of substantially all assets, without the
prior written consent of the other Party, except that without such consent,
Buyer may assign its rights to purchase the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Equity Interests to one or more of its controlled Affiliates, and
Seller may assign its, the Asset Selling Companies' or the Entity Selling
Company's rights to sell the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Equity
Interests hereunder to one or more of their respective Affiliates; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment by Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, shall relieve such assignor of any of its obligations hereunder.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 13.3_ shall be
null and void.

similar organization, in which case the Party (or Buyer Guarantor) required

other Party reasonable time to comment thereon in advance of such issuance;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of the Parties and Buyer Guarantor may
make internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent

The Seller Disclosure Schedules, the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, Schedules
and Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be construed with and as
an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been
set forth verbatim herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or
Schedule or in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Buyer Disclosure Schedules
but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this
Agreement. The representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this
Agreement are made and given subject to the disclosures contained in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be, or deemed to be, in breach of any such representations
and warranties (and no claim shall lie in respect thereof) in respect of any
such matter so disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedules. The
representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer made as of a specified
date shall be made only as of the date specified. Where only brief particulars
of a matter are set out or referred to in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or
a reference is made only to a particular part of a disclosed document, full
particulars of the matter and the full contents of the document are deemed to
be disclosed. Inclusion of information in the Seller Disclosure Schedules
will not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the
business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Business.
The Seller Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately titled Schedules
corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement, however, each Schedule
of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other Schedule of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on its face that the disclosure of such matter is applicable to such
Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules.

punctual observance and performance of each and every obligation of any
Buyer Assignee in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the Purchase

Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof in any other jurisdiction.

EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY. EACH PARTY

THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

Section 13.16   _Specific Performance_ _._

  



  

The Parties irrevocably agree that immediate, extensive and irreparable
damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law if any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached or threatened to be breached. It
is accordingly irrevocably agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ the Parties shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including in the form
of an immediate injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable relief shall be in addition
to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which the Parties are
entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for such non-performance, breach or
threatened breach. The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative
(and not alternative). Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the
security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy.
Each party further irrevocably agrees that (x) the only permitted objection
that it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it
contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of
this Agreement, and (y) that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law, equity or otherwise. If any
party brings any claim to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such party
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended by the period
of time between the commencement of such claim and ten (10) Business Days
following the date on which such claim is fully and finally resolved.

  



  

Section 13.17   _Time of Essence_ _._

  



  

With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

Section 13.18   _Currency_ _._

  



  

Subject to _Section 2.2_, all payments made by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement shall be made in United States dollars.

Section 13.19   _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney-Client Communications_
_._

  



  

(a) Each Party acknowledges that (i) one or more of the Transferred
Companies and/or their respective Affiliates have retained Kirkland and Ellis
LLP and certain other law firms (the " _Law Firms_ ") and relied on the in-
house legal advisors of Seller (together with the Law Firms, the " _Legal
Advisors_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and related agreements, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), as well as
other past and ongoing matters, (ii) the Legal Advisors have not acted as
counsel for Buyer or any of its past, present or future Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) no
Person other than Seller, the Transferred Companies or their respective
Affiliates has the status of a Legal Advisors client for conflict of interest
or any other purpose as a result thereof. Buyer hereby (I) waives and will
not assert, and will cause each of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Transferred Companies) to waive and not assert, any conflict of
interest relating to the Legal Advisors' representation after the Closing of
Seller or its Affiliates in any matter involving the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and related agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), including in any litigation,
arbitration, mediation or other proceeding, and (II) consents to, and will
cause each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies) to consent to, any such representation, even though, in each case,
(x) the interests of Seller or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to
Buyer, the Transferred Companies or their respective Affiliates, (y) any
Legal Advisor may have represented the Transferring Companies or their
respective Affiliates in a substantially related matter, or (z) any Legal
Advisor may be handling other ongoing matters for Buyer, the Transferred
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates.

  



  

(b) Buyer agrees that, after the Closing, none of Buyer, the
Transferred Companies or any of their Affiliates will have any right to
access or control any of the Legal Advisors' records or communications
relating to or affecting the Retained Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and related agreements, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby) (such records
or communications, the " _Attorney-Client Communications_ "), which will be
the property of (and be controlled by) Seller. In addition, Buyer agrees that
it would be impractical to remove all Attorney-Client Communications from the
records (including e-mails and other electronic files) of the Transferred
Companies. Accordingly, Buyer will not, and will cause each of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) not to, use any
Attorney-Client Communication remaining in the records of the
Transferred Companies after the Closing in a manner that may be adverse to
Seller or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or otherwise, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third Person other than a Party to this
Agreement, on the other hand, after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by the Legal Advisors to such third Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer and its Affiliates may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of Seller.

(c) Seller and Buyer agree that, to the extent permitted by Law,
their and their respective Affiliates' respective rights and obligations to
maintain, preserve, assert or waive any or all attorney-client and work
product privileges (and all other evidentiary privileges and the expectation
of client confidence as to all Attorney-Client Communications) belonging to
either Party hereto with respect to the Business and the Retained Business
(collectively, " _Privileges_ ") shall be governed by the provisions of this
_Section 13.19_. With respect to matters relating to the Retained Business or
any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or any other matter that Seller
has agreed to be responsible for after the Closing Date pursuant to
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, and with respect to all
confidential information of Seller and its Affiliates (including, until the
Closing, the Transferred Companies) relating to the sale of the Transferred
Companies, Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Business, Seller
and its Affiliates shall have sole authority in perpetuity to determine
whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) shall
take no action without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) that would reasonably
be likely to result in any waiver of any Privilege that could be asserted by
Seller or such Affiliate under applicable Law and this Agreement (in each
case except as provided for in the final sentence of _Section 13.19(b)_). The
rights and obligations created by this _Section 13.19(c)_ shall apply to all
confidential information as to which Seller and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, or any of the Transferred Companies, on the other hand, would be
entitled to assert or has asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect,
if any, of the transactions contemplated hereby (such information, "
_Privileged Information_ "). Buyer will not, and will cause each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) not to
take any action which could cause any Attorney-Client Communication to cease
being a confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under any
Privilege, including waiving such protection in any dispute with a Person that
is not Seller or any of its Affiliates. Furthermore, Buyer agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies), that in the event of a dispute between Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Transferred Companies, on the
other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter in which the Legal
Advisors jointly represented both parties, no Privileges will protect from
disclosure to Seller or its Affiliates any information or documents developed
or shared during the course of the Legal Advisors' joint representation of
the Transferred Companies and Seller.
