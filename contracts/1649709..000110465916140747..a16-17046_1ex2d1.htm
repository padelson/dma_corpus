NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

 **ARTICLE I.**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 1.1.** **_The Merger_**. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease, and the Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "
**Surviving Company** "), shall, by virtue of the Merger, continue its
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

 **Section 1.2.** **_Closing_**. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the
Merger (the " **Closing** ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City

applicable Law) of the conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VIII hereof
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the

those conditions as of the Closing), unless another time or date is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing, the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Dechert LLP, 1095 Avenue

 **Section 1.3.** **_Effective Time_**. Upon the Closing, the parties shall
file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger (the " **Certificate of Merger** "). The Merger shall become effective
at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "
**Effective Time** ").

 



 

 **Section 1.4.** **_Effects of the Merger_**. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.

 



 

 **Section 1.5.** **_Limited Liability Company Agreement_**. The LLC
Agreement of the Company will be amended in connection with the Merger to read
in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, shall be the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company and thereafter may be
amended as provided therein or by Law, subject to Section 6.2.

 



 

 **Section 1.6.** **_Directors; Officers_**. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Company and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each case,

their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Act and the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK**

 



 

 **Section 2.1.** **_Effect on Capital Stock_**. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Common Shares_. Each Common Share that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any
of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries (other than
shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company, which shall remain outstanding
with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to preserve its relative
interest in the Company, and other than shares held on behalf of third
parties) will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist,
and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Common Shares_. Each Common Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares
described in Section 2.1(a), (ii) Dissenting Shares and (iii) Rollover Shares
(each, an " **Excluded Share** " and collectively, the " **Excluded Shares**
")) will automatically be converted into solely the right to

 



      
 

 



 

receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration, payable upon surrender of such
shares in the manner provided in Section 2.4.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Common Shares_. All Common Shares shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and,
in the case of book-entry shares (" **Book-Entry Shares** "), the names of the

such shares, and, subject to Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.3, each holder of
Book-Entry Shares and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such Common Shares (each, a "
**Certificate** ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such Common Shares, except, in the case of the Company Shares that are not
Excluded Shares, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.4.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each common share of Merger Sub
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be converted into one (1) common share representing one
membership interest of the Surviving Company.

Company should, subject to and in accordance with Section 5.1, split, combine,
or otherwise reclassify the Common Shares or any rights, warrants or options
to acquire any Company Securities, or pay a dividend or other distribution in
Common Shares or otherwise change the Common Shares into any other securities,
or make any other such dividend or distribution in equity interests of the
Company in respect of the Common Shares, then any number or amount contained

appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, reclassification,
dividend or other distribution or change.

 



 

 **Section 2.2.** **_Treatment of Equity Awards_**.

 



 

(a) _Company Share Options_. The Company shall take all actions as may be
necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each option to acquire Common Shares
(each, a " **Company Share Option** ") that has not been forfeited (or if
previously forfeited, is required to be reinstated if a change in control
event or sale event occurs within a specified period following such
forfeiture) shall become fully vested to the extent not then fully vested, and
each Company Share Option shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Common Shares subject to such Company Share Option,
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Company Share Option; provided, however, that if
the result in clause (y) equals or is less than zero, such Company Share
Option shall be cancelled and forfeited with no payment due the holder
thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries
to pay, through the Companys regular payroll system on a special payroll date
which shall have been established by Company with its payroll provider prior
to Closing, the holders of Company Share Options the amounts due under this
Section 2.2(a) (less all applicable withholding Taxes and deductions) as
promptly as practicable (but in any event no later than three (3) days) after
the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Company Share Awards_. The Company shall take all actions as may be
necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Share Award (other than
any Company Share Award to be assumed by Parent pursuant to the Rollover
Agreements) that has not been forfeited (or if previously forfeited, is
required to be reinstated if a change in control event or sale event occurs
within a specified period following such forfeiture) shall become fully vested
if not already fully vested (and if such Company Share Award is subject to
performance based vesting, such Company Share Award shall become vested based
on the maximum level of performance for such Company Share Award except to the
extent provided in Section 2.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter), and all Company
Share Awards (other than any Company Share Award to be assumed by Parent
pursuant to the Rollover Agreements) shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of Common Shares in respect of such Company Share
Award (if such Company Share Award is subject to performance based vesting,
such aggregate number of Common Shares shall be determined assuming the
maximum level of performance for such Company Share Award except to the extent
provided in Section 2.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter) multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to pay the holders of Company Share Awards (other than any
Company Share Award to be assumed by Parent pursuant to the Rollover
Agreements), through the Companys regular payroll system on a special payroll
date which shall have been established by Company with its payroll provider
prior to Closing, the amounts due under this Section 2.2(b) (less all
applicable withholding Taxes and deductions) as promptly as practicable (but
in any event no later than three (3) days) after the Effective Time (or at
such later date as may be required to comply with Code Section 409A).

 



 

(c) _Company Warrant_. The Company shall take all actions as may be necessary
so that, at the Effective Time, each warrant to acquire Common Shares (each, a
" **Company Warrant** ") that has not been exercised shall be redeemed or
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (i) an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Common Shares
for which such Company Warrant is exercisable into, multiplied by (y) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
of such Company Warrant and (ii) dividends pursuant to Section 4.03 of the
Warrant Agreement in an amount equal to $1.59 per Common Share, plus any
dividends paid after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date. Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to pay the
holders of Company Warrants the amounts due under this Section 2.2(c) (less
all applicable withholding Taxes and deductions) at the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 2.3.** **_Dissenting Shares_**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Common Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by Shareholders
that have properly perfected their rights of appraisal within the meaning of
Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
**DGCL** ") (as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement (the "
**Dissenting Shares** ")) shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless and until such Shareholders shall have failed to
perfect any available right of appraisal thereunder, but, instead, the holders
thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the
Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement). If any such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of
appraisal, the Common Shares held by such

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this
Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.1(b). The
Company shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the
Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement) received by Company, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served or delivered in connection with
such demands pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the Company
pursuant to the LLC Agreement) and received by the Company, and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (as applicable to the Company
pursuant to the LLC Agreement). The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to any such
demand, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demand, or (iii) waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any
other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (as applicable to the Company pursuant to the LLC Agreement).

 



 

 **Section 2.4.** **_Payment Fund and Payment Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of the Common
Shares (other than Excluded Shares), Parent will designate, or cause to be
designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " **Paying Agent** ") to act as agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof that comply with
the requirements of Section 2.5) and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
ARTICLE II from time to time after the Effective Time. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent sufficient cash in U.S. dollars to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the issued and
outstanding Common Shares, other than amounts to be paid through the Companys
payroll system, which shall be paid to the Company (the " **Payment Fund** ").
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
pursuant to Section 2.1(b). Parent shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Common
Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent will enter into a paying agent
agreement on customary terms, which terms shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no
later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing, Parent shall
send, or cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form
as reasonably agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will pass,
only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or customary effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) or
Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or customary effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of
Section 2.5) and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or customary effective
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof that comply with the requirements of Section
2.5) or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed
and properly completed letter of transmittal, and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable in
exchange therefor cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
ARTICLE II, and the Certificate (and the Common Shares represented thereby) or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled; _provided that_ ,
with respect to any Shareholder who surrenders Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal and such other proper
documentation as the Paying Agent reasonably requests (which letter of
transmittal and other documentation Parent will cause the Paying Agent to
provide promptly upon request of a Shareholder, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time) the Paying Agent shall pay
to such Shareholder by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the
Closing Date the amount such Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to
this ARTICLE II.

 



 

(d) Until such Certificates (or customary effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof that comply with the requirements of Section 2.5) or Book-Entry
Shares, as the case may be, are so properly delivered, each such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof, subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.3. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Common Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such
Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(f) Any funds included in the Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying
Agent, as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be
limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed by, the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. If for
any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is at any time inadequate to
pay the amounts to which holders of Common Shares shall be entitled under
Section 2.1(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to promptly deposit
additional cash in U.S. dollars with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all
payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Company
shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time will be

 



      
 

 



 

delivered to the Surviving Company, on demand, and any holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II will
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of his or her claims
for Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other
Person will be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

 **Section 2.5.** **_Lost Certificates_**. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (a) the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, (b) the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate
and (c) the delivery of any other documentation (including an indemnity in
customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Paying Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

 



 

 **Section 2.6.** **_Withholding Rights_**. Each of the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Company and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Common Shares or any holder of a Company Equity Award or Company Warrant such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case
may be, and duly paid to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Common Shares or the holder of a Company Equity
Award or Company Warrant in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be.

 



 

 **Section 2.7.** **_Contribution and Issuance_**. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Rollover Holders and Parent shall effectuate the
Contribution and Issuance in accordance with the Rollover Agreements, pursuant
to which each such Rollover Holder shall receive equity interests in Parent
determined in accordance with such Rollover Holders Rollover Agreement. The
Company shall take such actions as are necessary and reasonably requested by
Parent in order to allow the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Rollover Agreements, including the assumption by Parent of certain Company
Share Awards, _provided_ , that such actions shall not have an adverse effect
on the Company or its equityholders (other than delaying the deductibility of
such Company Share Awards upon vesting).

 



 

 **Section 2.8.** **_Further Assurances_**. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.9.** **_Stock Transfer Books_**. At the close of business, New
York time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Common Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Shares formerly
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

applicable Fund Document that have resulted in or would result in
distributions to investors other than in material compliance with such Fund
Document. Since the date of each Funds most recently delivered Fund Report,
no occurrence, change or event that, individually, or in the aggregate with
any such other occurrences, changes or events, has had a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any such Fund to
perform any of their respective obligations under any Fund Document. Except as

trigger, interest coverage trigger or early amortization event (in each case
whether now cured or uncured) and no event (in each case whether now cured or
uncured) that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would
constitute any such event of default, trigger or other event listed in this
sentence, the occurrence of which would materially limit reinvestment activity
(other than, in each case, those limitations which intrinsically occur (i) as
the time remaining in the reinvestment period is reduced and (ii) after the
completion of the reinvestment period) by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any such Fund under any applicable Fund Document or would materially and

Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of each Common Share and the payment of all
associated costs and expenses of the Merger (including any repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company required in
connection therewith). There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter.

Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of
its and its Subsidiaries operations.

 



 

 **Section 5.2.** **_Rule 16b-3_**. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Interpretative
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities with respect to equity securities of the Company) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI.**

 



 

 **CERTAIN COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

 



 

 **Section 6.1.** **_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to honor all Employee Benefit Plans, and
compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that nothing herein
shall be construed as prohibiting the amendment or termination of any of the
foregoing in accordance with its terms. During the twelve (12) month period
commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to provide, each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
**Continuing Employees** "), with (i) base salaries, wages and commission
rates and bonus opportunities that, in the aggregate, are at least equal to
those that were provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) all other employee benefits (excluding change of
control benefits, retention bonuses and equity

 



      
 

 



 

incentive awards) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
employee benefits that were provided to the Continuing Employees immediately
before the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to,
provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the
one-year period following the Effective Time severance benefits that are no
less favorable than the severance benefits required under the severance plan
or arrangement covering such Continuing Employee as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. During such one-year period following the
Effective Time, severance benefits offered to each Continuing Employee shall
be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective
Time in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee.

 



 

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, severance, paid time off and level of benefits, but excluding benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under the benefit plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries or
any respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Effective Time (the " **New Plans** "), each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors), except where such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
such replacement and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, disability, life and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and limitations and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived, or caused to be waived, for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under an Employee
Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to such replacement to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be a "change in control," a "sale event" or similar event for purposes
of any applicable Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Company to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this Section
6.1 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing
herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to employees prior to or following the Effective
Time or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the

 



      
 

 



 

parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 6.1) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.2.** **_D andO Indemnification Continuation_**.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree (i) that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries
now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or
director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors and each Person who served at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators " **Indemnified Party** ") as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date
hereof and disclosed in Section 6.2 of the Disclosure Letter, shall survive
the Merger (with the obligations of the Company being assumed by the Surviving
Company) and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, and, in the
event that any proceeding with respect to which such indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be available is pending or asserted or any claim
with respect to which such indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
available is made during such period, until the final disposition of such
proceeding or claim and (ii) to cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to fulfill, honor and respect all such rights of the Indemnified
Parties.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
the Company Organizational Documents, Parent and the Surviving Company (the "
**Indemnifying Parties** ") shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
in each case, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors, or served at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another company,
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)
actions or omissions of an Indemnified Party taken in their capacity as such
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as
such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Companys receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified under the Company Organizational
Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, if available, the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (
_provided_ that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies, of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and other Indemnified Parties when compared to the insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain "tail"
insurance policies from the Companys current insurance carrier or an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with a claims period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and other
Indemnified Parties, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided,
however, that in no event will the Company expend or the Surviving Company be
required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " **Maximum Premium** "). If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the
Maximum Premium, the Company or Surviving Company, as applicable will obtain,
and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to obtain, that amount of
directors and officers insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 6.2
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 6.2 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 6.2 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.2,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.2). In the event
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity in such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.2. The
agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive
of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 6.2 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies. If Parent or the Surviving Company make any
payment with respect to a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses
pursuant to Section 6.2(a), Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies
of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim. In the event of any payment by
Parent or its Affiliate to an

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party under this Section 6.2, Parent or its Affiliate (as the case
may be) shall be subrogated, to the extent of any such payment, to all rights
of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries under the applicable directors
and officers (or other) insurance policy referred to in this Section 6.2.
Without limiting the generality of any other provision hereof, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries shall duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation rights described
in the preceding sentence.

 



 

 **Section 6.3.** **Tax Matters**. Parent shall cause the Company to prepare
all Tax Returns of the Company for any taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date which are not filed as of the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, to the extent a valid election under Section 754 of
the Code (and any corresponding provision of state and local Law) is not in
effect as of the date hereof for the Company, the Company shall make such
election in the prescribed time and manner required for such election to be
effective for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent drafts of any material Tax Return
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries no later than ten (10)
days prior to filing of such Tax Return, and shall, prior to filing thereof,
make any changes reasonably requested by Parent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 



 

 **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1.** **_Preparation of Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders
Meeting_**.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement (whether or not the Board of Directors of the Company has made
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, but subject to the Companys rights
under Section 9.1(f)) and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the
Proxy Statement to the holders of Common Shares in advance of such meeting.
Except to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 7.5
hereof, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation.
Subject to Section 7.5 hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from the holders of Common Shares proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger.

 



 

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company will (i)
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, (ii) respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC
with respect to such filing and will provide copies of such comments to Parent
and Merger Sub promptly and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
following receipt thereof, (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare
and file (after Parent and Merger Sub have had a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on) any response, amendments or supplements necessary to be
filed in response to any SEC

 



      
 

 



 

comments or as required by Law, (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to
mail the Proxy Statement to the Companys Shareholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, and (v)
to the extent required by applicable Law, as promptly as reasonably
practicable prepare, file and distribute to the Companys Shareholders any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement if any event shall occur which
requires such action at any time after the mailing of the Proxy Statement and
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting. Parent and Merger Sub shall each
cooperate with the Company in connection with the foregoing sentence,
including the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and responding to
the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the
SEC, including furnishing the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
with any and all information with respect to Parent and Merger Sub as may be
required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under the Exchange Act or as
otherwise requested by the SEC. The Company will, to the extent practicable,
(i) provide Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements thereto and
(ii) consider in good faith all additions, deletions or changes reasonably
proposed by Parent and Merger Sub, in each case, prior to filing the same with
the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Shareholders.

 



 

 **Section 7.2.** **_Investment Advisory Arrangement Consents and Investor
Waivers_**.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Consent (including any Consent set forth in Section
3.4 of the Disclosure Letter) to the assignment or deemed assignment of an
Investment Advisory Arrangement with Clients of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a direct result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is required by applicable Law or by such Clients Investment
Advisory Arrangement, the Company and each such Subsidiary shall send to such
Clients two (2) written notices (other than with respect to an Investment
Advisory Arrangement that permits a Negative Consent, in which case the
Company and each such Subsidiary shall send at least one (1) written notice)
(each, a " **Notice** ") (the first at least forty-five (45) days prior to the
Closing Date and the second, if applicable, approximately thirty (30) days
after the first) informing such Clients of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and requesting the appropriate Consent (or through the
acquisition of Negative Consent if expressly permitted by the applicable
Investment Advisory Arrangement) to the assignment or deemed assignment of
such Clients Investment Advisory Arrangement (such Notices to state, for
those Investment Advisory Arrangements that expressly permit a Negative
Consent, consistent with customary practice that, following delivery of an
appropriate notice to a Client, such Clients Consent will be deemed to have
been obtained if the Client does not object by a specified means prior to the
Closing Date (a " **Negative Consent** ")). With respect to Contracts with
Clients the terms of

 



      
 

 



 

which require a Consent other than a Negative Consent as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated herein, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (without a requirement to offer or grant any material
accommodation or material alteration of terms (financial or otherwise)) to
obtain the required Consents; _provided, however_ , that prior to obtaining
any Consent which would require payment of any fee above the Fee Payment
Threshold, the Company shall have obtained the written consent of Parent. The
parties hereto agree that with respect to any Contract that expressly permits
a Negative Consent, sending the written notices required in this Section
7.2(a) shall be deemed to constitute commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the required Consent and the required Consent will be deemed to have been
obtained if the Client does not object by a specified means prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) In respect of the Investor Waivers which are required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
use commercially reasonable efforts (without a requirement to offer or grant
any material accommodation or material alteration of terms (financial or
otherwise)) to obtain such Investor Waivers in the manner prescribed under the
applicable Fund Documents as to constitute a valid Consent thereunder on the
earliest practicable date; _provided, however_ , that prior to obtaining any
Investor Waiver which would require payment of any fee above the Fee Payment
Threshold, the Company shall have obtained the written consent of Parent.

 



 

(c) At the reasonable request of Parent, subject to applicable fiduciary
duties, the terms of the relevant Investment Advisory Arrangement and as
permitted by applicable Law, the Company, as determined in the Companys
reasonable discretion, may request that each Investment Adviser Subsidiary (x)
provide a Notice to any Client that has not consented to the assignment prior
to the Closing stating that such Clients account may be terminated if such
consent is not received by the Closing and (y) terminate the Investment
Advisory Arrangement with such Client effective immediately prior to the
Closing if such consent has not been received.

 



 

(d) In connection with obtaining the Advisers Act Consents, the Investor
Waivers and other actions required by Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b), at
all times prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take reasonable steps
to keep Parent informed of the status of obtaining such Advisers Act Consents
and Investor Waivers and shall prior to Closing make available to Parent
copies of all such executed Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers and,
upon reasonable prior notice from Parent, make available for Parents
inspection the originals of such Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers
and any related materials and other records relating to such consent process.
Without limiting the foregoing or the terms set forth in Section 7.3, in
connection with obtaining the Advisers Act Consents and Investor Waivers
required under Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b), the Company shall have
obtained Parents approval of the form and substance of any Notice or other
materials to be distributed to the Client or other Persons in order to obtain
the necessary Advisers Act Consent or Investor Waiver, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 



 

(e) The Company shall promptly notify Parent after the receipt by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of any written notice that any Client (i) has
ceased or will cease, to use any services of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) has substantially reduced, or will substantially reduce,
the use of services of the Company or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries or (iii) has sought, or is seeking, to reduce any fees it will
pay for any services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) In addition to the Notices required by this Section 7.2, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in good faith to develop a mutually acceptable communications plan
for communicating the status of the transaction to the Clients, investors in
Funds, employees, suppliers and vendors to the extent the Company and Parent
mutually determine in good faith that it would be advisable to have such
communications.

 



 

(g) The consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any amendment or
modification to any Client Contract for the purpose of obtaining any such
consent that is adverse in any material respect to Parent, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that the payment of any fee in
connection with obtaining a Consent or Investor Waiver that is effectuated in
accordance with Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b) above shall in no
circumstance be determined to be an amendment or modification to a Client
Contract that is adverse in any material respect to Parent, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub
agree that it will not intentionally (or recklessly) take (or fail to take)
any action (including by means of announcing intentions with respect to the
operations of the Company following the Closing) that would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to or otherwise materially impair in any
respect the efforts of the Company to obtain the Advisers Act Consents or the
Investor Waivers as contemplated in this Section 7.2.

 



 

 **Section 7.3.** **_Access to Information_**. Upon reasonable prior notice,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and
its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, in a
manner as shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to the properties, offices, personnel, other facilities and
all books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to Parent and its Representatives, all other data, information,
agreements and documents concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that, in the
Companys reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would violate any of
its contractual obligations to a third party with respect to confidentiality,
or (ii) any Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries requires the
Company, its Subsidiaries to preclude Parent or its Representatives from
gaining access to such properties or information; _provided, further_ , that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
required consent of any third party necessary to provide such disclosure under
clause (i) above; _provided, further_ , that Parent and its Representatives
shall not have access to individual medical histories or information that is
subject to attorney client privilege ( _provided_ , that with respect to any
such privileged information, the Company shall promptly provide a description
of any information, documents, data or other material withheld (without
disclosing privileged information) and the reason for which it was withheld),
nor shall they be permitted to conduct any environmental sampling. Parent will
hold, and will cause its Representatives to hold, any information or documents
received or provided pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.3 in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
the provisions of that certain letter agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the "
**Confidentiality Agreement** "), between the Company and Parent, which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth therein. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, no investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall affect the
representations, warranties, agreements, covenants or conditions of the
parties set forth in this Agreement, including the conditions to Closing set
forth in ARTICLE VIII hereof.

 



 

 **Section 7.4.** **_Reasonable Best Efforts_**.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including those contained in this Section 7.4(a)), each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all
conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
Consents from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, and
(ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
The Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall, subject to
applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the
taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) immediately above
and (y) supply the other with any information that may be reasonably required
in order to effectuate the taking of such actions.

 



 

(b) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto,
as the case may be, of any material communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the
Company or Parent receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable
Governmental Entity, provide the other party and its counsel with advance
notice and the opportunity to participate in any material meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section
7.4(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the
HSR Act (each such Governmental Entity, a " **Governmental Antitrust
Authority** ") information and documents requested by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and
filing any notification and report form and related material required under
the HSR Act as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement)
and thereafter to respond as promptly as

 



      
 

 



 

practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material
that may be made under the HSR Act, and (ii) subject to the terms set forth in
Section 7.4(d) hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions
as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or
expiration of applicable waiting periods.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall take any and all action necessary to obtain any
necessary approval from any Governmental Antitrust Authority or Governmental
Entity or to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any Governmental Entity
under the HSR Act or to prevent the entry of any Order that would otherwise
make the Merger unlawful, including but not limited to: (i) disposing or
transferring any asset, including those of Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Affiliates or the Company; (ii) licensing or otherwise making
available to any Person, any technology or other Intellectual Property of
Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or the Company; (iii) holding
separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date) of
Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or the Company; or (iv)
changing or modifying any course of conduct or otherwise making any commitment
(to any Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding future operations of the
business of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or the Company. If
any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger as violative of the
HSR Act, or if any Order is entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or
enforced by a court or other Governmental Entity, which Order would make the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger illegal or would
otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall make any
and all efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger and to have such Order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger.

 



 

(e) The Company, Merger Sub, and Parent shall cooperate with one another in
determining whether any Consent (other than those Consents contemplated by
Section 7.2) from a third party is required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents set

money, (other than nominal amounts), commence litigation or pay or grant any
other form of compensation to any such Person in connection with obtaining

(f) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company,

 **Section 7.5.** **_Acquisition Proposals_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 7.5, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, Representatives or other intermediaries), nor
shall (directly or indirectly) the Company authorize any of its or its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, Representatives or other intermediaries or
Subsidiaries to: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate (it being
understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not otherwise prohibited
by this Section 7.5 (such as answering unsolicited phone calls) shall not be
deemed to "facilitate" for purposes of this Section 7.5) the submission of
inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person (other than Parent) relating to
any Acquisition Proposal, or agree to or recommend any Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) enter into any agreement (x) to consummate any Acquisition Proposal, (y)
to approve any Acquisition Proposal or (z) requiring it to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Merger; (iii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish any non-public
information with respect to its business, properties or assets in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) waive, terminate, modify or release any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from
any provision of or grant any permission, waiver or request under any
"standstill" or similar agreement or obligation, unless the Companys Board of
Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (v) agree to resolve to take, or
take, any of the actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this
sentence. The Company shall immediately cease, and cause its Representatives
and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and shall immediately terminate online
data room access to all such parties and their Representatives. For purposes
of this Section 7.5, the term " **Person** " means any person, corporation,
entity or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other
than, with respect to the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, following the receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, contact the Person that has made such Acquisition
Proposal to (i) clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof solely
to facilitate the Board of Directors of the Companys determination of whether
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) inform such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 7.5.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.5, the Company,
directly or indirectly through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
Representatives or other intermediaries, may, prior to the receipt of the
Required Company Vote, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Person (and its Representatives and intermediaries) that has made an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or
arising out of a breach of Section 7.5(a), and/or (ii) furnish to such Person
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent nonpublic information
that has not been made available to Parent is made available to such Person,
make available or furnish such nonpublic information to Parent promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) following the time it is provided to such
Person, in the case of each of clauses (i) or (ii), if, and only if, prior to
taking such particular action, the

 



      
 

 



 

Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.5 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Companys Board of
Directors may (x) withdraw, modify or amend in any manner adverse to Parent
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal, or enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or resolve
or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (a " **Company Adverse
Recommendation Change** ") (i) in response to an Intervening Event, or (ii)
following receipt of an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.5 and which the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith, in consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, in the case of
each of clauses (i) and (ii), if and only if, the Companys Board of Directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and subject to the
Companys compliance with Section 7.5(d) or (y) following receipt of an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a breach of this Section 7.5 and which the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.1(f) and enter into a definitive
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (a "
**Company Acquisition Agreement** " (for the avoidance of doubt an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement shall not constitute a Company Acquisition
Agreement)) with respect to such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, the
Companys Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and the Company complies with Section 7.5(d) and, concurrently
with entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 9.2(c).

 



 

(d) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under Section
7.5(c)(x)(i), the Company shall (A) provide Parent with at least four (4)
Business Days prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail,
the reasons therefor and all material information with respect to such
Intervening Event (including in relation to all developments related thereto),
and (B) if requested by Parent, during such four (4) Business Day period,
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that the Companys Board of Directors would determine in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Companys Board of Directors to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii) under Section 7.5(c)(x)(ii) or
Section 7.5(c)(y) the Company shall provide Parent with at least four (4)
Business Days prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable in
connection with the applicable Acquisition Proposal

 



      
 

 



 

shall require a new notice and a two (2) Business Day period) advising Parent
that the Companys Board of Directors intends to take such action, specifying
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and that the
Company shall, if requested by Parent, during such four (4) Business Day
period (or two (2) Business Day period, if applicable), negotiate with Parent
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal
would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt of any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal and keep
Parent reasonably informed as to the material details of all discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal (in each case in a
manner that is not unduly disruptive of the Companys ability to conduct good
faith discussions in accordance with this Section 7.5 with the party making
such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, advisors and agents) and
shall provide Parent within 24 hours after receipt thereof all copies of any
other documentation, including any drafts of a Company Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, material to understanding such
Acquisition Proposal (as determined by the Company) received by the Company
from the Person (or from any Representatives, advisors or agents of such
Person) making such Acquisition Proposal or with whom such discussions or
negotiations are taking place; _provided_ that, for the sake of clarity, it is
understood and agreed that all such information and communications shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Companys Board of Directors, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to the Companys Shareholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to the Companys Shareholders), and none of the foregoing shall constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change _provided_ that any such disclosure
(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or other similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, or an express rejection of the Acquisition Proposal or a reaffirmation of
the Company Board Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board fails to expressly and publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days
following any request by Parent in response to such Company disclosure (it
being agreed that Parent may only make one (1) request with respect to any
single such disclosure).

 



 

 **Section 7.6.** **_Shareholder Litigation_**. The Company shall keep Parent
informed of and consult and cooperate with Parent in connection with, any
shareholder litigation or claim against the Company and/or its directors or
officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than any litigation where the interests of the Company or any
of its Affiliates are adverse to those of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their

 



      
 

 



 

respective Affiliates) and the Company shall consider in good faith any
suggestions by Parent with respect thereto.

 



 

 **Section 7.7.** **_Public Announcements_**. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub agrees that no public release or public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable Governmental Entity, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance (and the disclosing party will consider such comments
in good faith) _provided_ that (i) each party may issue such press releases or
make any such public statements in connection with any dispute between the
parties hereto regarding this Agreement without obtaining the other parties
prior written consent, (ii) the restrictions in this Section 7.7 shall not
apply to the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal or a Company
communication in connection with or following a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change effected in accordance with Section 7.5.

 



 

 **Section 7.8.** **_Takeover Statutes_**. If any business combination,
control share acquisition, fair price or similar statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and
their respective Boards of Directors will (a) take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
takeover statute.

 



 

 **Section 7.9.** **_Certain Notices_**. The Company shall notify Parent and

communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any Actions commenced, or to such

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) any event, change or
effect between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes
or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions to Closing (A) set forth in
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), in the case of the Company, or (B) set forth
in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b), in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, not
to be satisfied at the Closing. In no event shall (x) the delivery of any
notice by a party pursuant to this Section 7.9 limit or otherwise affect the
respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement, or (y) disclosure by the Company or Parent be deemed to
amend or supplement the Disclosure Letter or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty.

of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)) or prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section

directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, employees, Affiliates
and Representatives and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of

of the parties hereto.

 



 

 **Section 9.4.** **_Extension; Waiver_**. At any time prior to the Effective

for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and

of those rights.

contemplated hereby and supersede and replace all prior and contemporaneous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with regard to such
transactions.

 



 

 **Section 10.8.** **_Parties in Interest_**. Except for the rights to
continued indemnification and insurance pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof (of
which the Persons entitled to indemnification or insurance, as the case may

other Person), other than (a) the parties hereto and their respective

the obligations or liability of any third Persons to the Company, Parent or

product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.4
without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree not to oppose a request by
any party hereto (as opposed to the shareholders of any such party or any
unaffiliated third party) for expedited proceedings with regard to any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any party seeking an injunction or

applicability of such matter so referenced is reasonably apparent upon a
reading of the disclosure without any independent knowledge on the part of the
reader regarding the matter disclosed. The inclusion of any information in the
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in
and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed or made available, is material, has resulted in or would result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business.
