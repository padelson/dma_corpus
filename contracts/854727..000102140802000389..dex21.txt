     WHEREAS, Parent, Newco and the Company have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of November 21, 2001 (the "Original Agreement");

     WHEREAS, Parent, Newco and the Company desire to amend and restate in its
entirety the Original Agreement in accordance with the terms contained herein;

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors")
has, subject to the conditions of this Agreement, determined that the Merger (as
defined in Section 1.1 below) is in the best interests of the shareholders of
the Company and approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions

of 1988, as amended (the "PBCL");

     WHEREAS, Parent, Newco and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger;

     WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

     WHEREAS, the Company and Parent have each obtained voting agreements in the
form of Exhibit A attached hereto, from the directors, executive officers and

     WHEREAS, Parent has entered into an agreement dated as of October 17, 2001

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

<PAGE>

warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be
legally bound, Parent, Newco and the Company hereby agree as follows:

               ARTICLE I -- THE MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING

     1.1  The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
          ----------
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 below), the Company and Newco
shall, in accordance with the PBCL, consummate a merger (the "Merger") in which
the Company shall be merged with and into Newco and the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. In lieu of the Company being
merged with and into Newco, if all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(excluding the condition set forth in Section 7.1(h) and any conditions that, by
their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date (as hereinafter
defined)) have been satisfied or waived, and if, based on a reasonable good
faith determination, the combination of (a) the trading price of Parent Common
Stock (as defined in Section 5.2 below) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(by taking into account the Reorganization Assumption (as defined in Section
6.11 below)), (b) the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration (plus the aggregate
amount of cash paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Stock
pursuant to Section 3.1(e) hereof) received by holders of Company Shares (as
defined in Section 3.1 below) in the Merger and (c) the aggregate amount paid to
holders of the Company's Preferred Stock in connection with any redemption by
the Company of such shares (the "Redemption Amount") could result in an amount
exceeding 60% of the combination of (i) the Redemption Amount and (ii) the total
fair market value of the aggregate consideration payable and deliverable to the
holders of Company Stock as a result of the Merger (such circumstance described
above being referred to herein as a "Reverse Merger Circumstance"), then the
"Merger" shall automatically be a merger of Newco with and into the Company at
the Effective Time, in which case, as a consequence of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Newco shall thereupon cease. The corporation surviving
the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation." In
accordance with Section 1929 of the PBCL, all of the rights, privileges, powers,
immunities, purposes and franchises of Newco and the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties
of Newco and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Surviving Corporation. The parties acknowledge and agree that in
the event of a Reverse Merger Circumstance, the Merger is not intended to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

     1.2  Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or
          --------------
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, the appropriate
parties hereto shall execute in the manner required by the PBCL and file with
the Pennsylvania Department of State articles of merger relating to the Merger,
and the parties shall take such other and further actions as may be required by
Law (as defined in Section 4.13 below) to make the Merger effective. The time
the Merger becomes effective in accordance with applicable Law is hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time."

     1.3  Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set forth
          ---------------------
in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

                                       2

     1.4  Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
          -------
(a) at the offices of Barley, Snyder, Senft & Cohen, LLC, 501 Washington Street,
Reading, Pennsylvania 19603, at 10:00 a.m. on the first business day following
the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof
shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such
other place, time and date as Parent and the Company may agree.

in accordance with the PBCL; provided, however, that Article I of such Articles
of Incorporation shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The name

Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with PBCL.

     2.3  Directors. The directors of Newco at the Effective Time shall, from

          (a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (together
with any associated Company Rights (as defined below), the "Company Shares") or
capital stock of Newco:

               (i)  Each Company Share, together with any associated right to
purchase one common share (a "Company Right"), issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement,

                                       3
<PAGE>

dated as of March 1, 2000, by and between the Company and First Union National

Parent, Newco or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(collectively, "Parent Companies") and (B) Company Shares owned by any of the
Company's direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries or held in the treasury
of the Company ("Treasury Shares")) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be cancelled
and extinguished and converted into the right to receive, the Parent Stock
Consideration, Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon, or the
combination of Parent Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration, without any
interest thereon, as specified in Section 3.3 hereof (the "Merger
Consideration").

               (ii) For purposes hereof, the following terms have the following
respective meanings:

               "Cash Consideration" means a per Company Share amount in cash
          equal to $33.00.

               "Cash Consideration Cap" means the product of (i) the Maximum
          Cash Percentage, (ii) the number of Outstanding Shares and (iii)
          $33.00.

               "Ceiling Market Price" means $23.00.

               "Closing Market Price" shall be the volume weighted average of
          the per share sales prices (excluding after-market trading) for Parent
          Stock, calculated to two decimal places, for the twenty (20) trading
          days, during which trading in Parent Stock occurs, immediately
          preceding the date which is two (2) business days before the Effective
          Time, as reported on the National Market System of the National
          Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
          ("Nasdaq"), the foregoing period of twenty (20) trading days being
          hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Price Determination Period"
          (For example, if March 31, 2002 were to be the Effective Date and
          Parent Stock trades on each trading day during the Price Determination
          Period, then the Price Determination Period would be February 28,
          March 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26
          and 27, 2002).

               "Conversion Ratio" means (calculated to the nearest 0.0001):

          (b)  2.5385 if the Closing Market Price is less than the Floor Market
Price;

          (c)  the quotient determined by dividing $33.00 (the numerator) by the
Closing Market Price (the denominator), if the Closing Market Price is equal to
or greater than the Floor Market Price and equal to or less than the Ceiling
Market Price; or

          (d)  1.4348, if the Closing Market Price is greater than the Ceiling
Market Price.

               "Fixed Price Parent Stock Range" means the range of Closing
Market Prices from and including the Floor Market Price to the Ceiling Market
Price.

                                       4
<PAGE>

               "Floor Market Price" means $13.00.

               "Outstanding Shares" means the aggregate number of Company Shares
          outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding
          Company Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(g), which
          number will not be greater than the number of shares of Company Common
          Stock (as defined in Section 4.2 below) outstanding on November 21,
          2001 (except for shares issuable upon exercise of stock options or on
          conversion of Company Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 4.2
          below) outstanding on November 21, 2001).

               "Parent Stock" means the common stock, par value $0.16 per share,
          of Parent.

               "Parent Stock Consideration" means a per Company Share number of
          shares of Parent Stock equal to one share multiplied by the Conversion
          Ratio. In the event that between November 21, 2001 and the Effective
          Time, the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Stock shall have
          been affected or changed into a different number of shares or a
          different class of shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock
          split, stock dividend, spin-off, extraordinary dividend,
          recapitalization, reclassification, subdivision, combination of shares
          or other similar transaction, or there shall have been a record date
          declared for any such matter, the Parent Stock Consideration shall be
          proportionately adjusted.

               "Parent Stock Consideration Cap" equals 9,467,068 shares of
          Parent Stock.

          (e)  No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Stock shall be issued in respect of Company Shares that are to be converted in
the Merger into Parent Stock, no dividend or distribution with respect to shares
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share of
Parent Stock, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Stock in
respect of Company Shares that are to be converted in the Merger into Parent
Stock an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent,
determined by multiplying (i) the Closing Market Price by (ii) the fractional
interest in a share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled.

          (f)  Each share of Parent Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger shall remain issued and outstanding.

          (g)  Any shares of Company Stock owned by the Parent Companies and
Treasury Shares shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and shall
cease to exist and no Parent Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

          (h)  On or after the Effective Time, holders of certificates
representing Company Shares (the "Certificates") immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have

                                       5
<PAGE>

any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each Company Share held by them.

     3.2  Election Procedure.
          ------------------

          (a)  Each holder of Company Shares (other than holders of Company
Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section 3.1(g)) shall have the right to
submit a request specifying that all of such holder's Company Shares shall be
converted into the Parent Stock Consideration, into the Cash Consideration or
into a combination of Cash Consideration and Parent Stock Consideration, without
interest in the Merger in accordance with the following procedure:

               (i)   Each holder of Company Stock may specify in a request made
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2 (herein called an
"Election") to:

                     (A)  convert each Company Share owned by such holder into
the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration in the Merger (a "Stock
Election");

                     (B)  convert each Company Share owned by such holder into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger (a "Cash Election");
or

                     (C)  convert all of the Company Shares owned by such holder
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the ratio of fifty-five
percent (55%) in the form of Cash Consideration and forty-five percent (45%) in
the form of Parent Stock Consideration (a "Cash/Stock Election").

               (ii)

                     (A)  On a per Company Share basis within the Fixed Price
Parent Stock Range, the value of the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
based on a Stock Election (assuming no proration thereof under Section 3.3)
would be $33.00 in Parent Stock Consideration (using the Closing Market Price).

                     (B)  On a per Company Share basis within the Fixed Price
Parent Stock Range, the value of the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
based on a Cash Election (assuming no proration thereof under Section 3.3) would
be $33.00 in Cash Consideration.

                     (C)  On a per Company Share basis, within the Fixed Price
Parent Stock Range, the value of the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
based on a Cash/Stock Election would be $18.15 in Cash Consideration and $14.85
in Parent Stock Consideration (using the Closing Market Price).

               (iii) A Form of Election (as defined in 3.2(b) below) shall be
included with each copy of the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 6.9)
mailed to shareholders of the Company in connection with the meeting of
shareholders called to consider the approval of this Agreement. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail or otherwise make available the
Form of Election to all persons who become record holders of Company Shares

                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent to the date of such mailing and prior to the Election Deadline (as
defined in Section 3.2(d) below).

          (b)  Parent shall prepare a form (the "Form of Election"), which shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, pursuant to which
each holder of Company Shares as of the Effective Time may make an Election and
which shall be mailed to the Company's shareholders in accordance with Section
3.2(a) so as to permit the Company's shareholders to exercise their right to
make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

          (c)  Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such shares as
nominees, trustees, or in other representative capacities may submit multiple
Forms of Election, provided that such representative certifies that each Form of
Election covers all Shares held by such representative for a particular
beneficial owner.

          (d)  Reasonably promptly following the initial filing of the Joint
Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 6.9 below) with the SEC, as contemplated
in Section 6.9 hereof, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company as the person to receive Forms of Election and to act
as exchange agent under this Agreement, which bank shall be acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"). Any Company shareholder's Election shall have
been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the
Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by certificates for the Company Shares to which such Form of
Election relates (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States provided such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by
the time required in such guarantee of delivery). Failure to deliver Company
Shares covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such
guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election. As
used herein, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on the
tenth day after the Effective Time. In the event this Agreement shall have been
terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall immediately
return any Forms of Election and Certificates for Company Shares to the
appropriate Company shareholders. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record as of the Effective Time a notice containing the conversion
ratio.

          (e)  Any Company shareholder may at any time prior to the Election
Deadline change his Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a revised Form of Election
properly completed and signed.

          (f)  Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, revoke his Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline
of his certificates for Parent Stock, or of the guarantee of delivery of such
certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall
be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent
or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated. Any Company shareholder
who shall have deposited certificates for Company Shares with the Exchange Agent
shall have the right to withdraw such certificates by written notice received by
the Exchange

                                       7
<PAGE>

Agent prior to the Election Deadline and thereby revoke his Election as of the
Election Deadline if the Merger shall not have been consummated prior thereto.

          (g)  Parent shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of the Forms of Election,
the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making
the determinations prescribed by Section 3.3, the issuance and delivery of
certificates for Parent Stock into which Company Shares are converted in the
Merger and the payment of cash for Company Shares converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger.

     3.3  Conversion of Outstanding Shares Into Parent Stock Consideration and
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash Consideration; Proration. The manner in which each Company Share (except
-----------------------------
Company Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section 3.1(g)) shall be
converted in the Merger into Parent Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration or a
combination of Parent Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration shall be as set
forth in this Section 3.3.

          (a)  As is more fully set forth below, the aggregate number of Company
Shares to be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration in the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed the product of (i) the number
of Outstanding Shares and (ii) the Maximum Cash Percentage. "Maximum Cash
Percentage" shall mean fifty-five percent (55%). Each of the terms of this
Article 3 (specifically including the proration provisions set forth in Sections
3.3(d) and 3.3(f)) shall be interpreted in a manner to ensure that in no event
shall either (A) the aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration received by the
holders of Company Shares in the Merger exceed the Cash Consideration Cap, or
(B) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock received by the holders of
Company Shares in the Merger exceed the Parent Stock Consideration Cap.

          (b)  Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.3(d) - (g) below, in the
event the Closing Market Price is less than the Floor Market Price, the Merger
Consideration shall be calculated as follows:

               (i)   On a per Company Share basis, the value of the Cash
Consideration on the Closing Date based on the Cash/Stock Election, would be
$18.15 and the value of the Parent Stock Consideration would be equal to the
product of (A) the Conversion Ratio, (B) .45 and (C) the fair market value of
the Parent Stock on the Closing Date.

               (ii)  On a per Company Share basis, the value of the Parent Stock
Consideration, based on a Stock Election (assuming no proration thereof under
this Section 3.3), would be the product of (A) the Conversion Ratio and (B) the
fair market value of the Parent Stock on the Closing Date; and

               (iii) On a per Company Share basis, the value of the Cash
Consideration, based on a Cash Election (assuming no proration thereof under
this Section 3.3), would be $33.00 in Cash Consideration.

          (c)  If, based solely on the Stock Elections and Cash/Stock Elections
(including those deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 3.3(g), the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock that would otherwise be issued as
Parent Stock Consideration would be

                                       8
<PAGE>

equal to or less than the Parent Stock Consideration Cap, then each Company
Share that the holder has elected to have converted into Parent Stock
Consideration pursuant to a Stock Election or a Cash/Stock Election shall be
converted into Parent Stock Consideration.

          (d)  If, based solely on the Stock Elections and Cash/Stock Elections
(including those deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 3.3(g)), the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock that would otherwise be issued as
Parent Stock Consideration would exceed the Parent Stock Consideration Cap, then
the Company Shares for which conversion into Parent Stock Consideration has been
requested pursuant to Stock Elections shall be converted into the right to
receive Parent Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration as follows:

               (i)  the number of Company Shares of each holder to be converted
into the right to receive Parent Stock Consideration shall equal the product of
(A) the number of Company Shares owned by such holder and (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which will be an amount equal to the Parent Stock Consideration Cap
MINUS the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock to be issued to holders of
Company Shares who have made (including those deemed to have done so pursuant to
Section 3.3(g)) Cash/Stock Elections, and the denominator of which will be the
Unadjusted Stock Election Number. "Unadjusted Stock Election Number" shall mean
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock that would be issued in the
Merger in respect of Company Shares for which the holders thereof made Stock
Elections, without taking into account the application of the proration
provisions of this Section 3.3(d).

               (ii) Each Company Share covered by a Stock Election and not
converted into the right to receive Parent Stock Consideration pursuant to
clause (i) above shall be converted in the Merger into Cash Consideration.

          (e)  If Cash Elections and Cash/Stock Elections request the conversion
into Cash Consideration of a number of Company Shares less than the number
constituting the Maximum Cash Percentage, each Company Share for which
conversion into Cash Consideration has been requested shall be converted into
the right to receive Cash Consideration.

          (f)  If Cash Elections and Cash/Stock Elections (including those
deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 3.3(g) below) request the
conversion into Cash Consideration of a number of Company Shares that exceed the
product of the Outstanding Shares multiplied by the Maximum Cash Percentage, the
Company Shares for which conversion into Cash Consideration have been requested
pursuant to a Cash Election shall be converted into the right to receive Cash
Consideration and Parent Stock Consideration in the following manner:

               (i)  The number of Company Shares of each holder to be converted
into the right to receive Cash Consideration shall equal the product of (A) the
number of Company Shares owned by such holder and (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which will be an amount equal to the Cash Consideration Cap MINUS the
aggregate amount of Cash Consideration to be paid to holders of Company Shares
who have made (including those deemed to have done so pursuant to Section
3.3(g)) Cash/Stock Elections, and the denominator of which will be the
Unadjusted Cash Election Amount. "Unadjusted Cash Election Amount" shall mean
the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration paid in the Merger in respect of
Company

                                       9
<PAGE>

Shares for which the holders thereof made Cash Elections, without taking into
account the application of the proration provisions of this Section 3.3(f).

               (ii) Each Company Share covered by a Cash Election and not
converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration pursuant to clause (i)
above shall be converted in the Merger into Parent Stock Consideration.

          (g)  Each Non-Electing Company Share shall be converted in the Merger
into Parent Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration as if the holder
thereof had made a Cash/Stock Election. "Non-Electing Company Share" shall mean
any Outstanding Share for which an Election is not in effect at the Election
Deadline. If Parent shall determine that any Election is not properly made with
respect to any Company Shares, such Election shall be deemed to be not in
effect, and the Company Shares covered by such Election shall, for purposes
hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Company Shares. Parent and the Exchange
Agent shall have no obligation to notify any person of any defect in any Form of
Election submitted to the Exchange Agent.

          (h)  Subject to Section 3.3(a), the Exchange Agent shall make all
computations contemplated by this Section 3.3 and all such computations shall be
conclusive and binding on the holders of Company Shares absent manifest error.

     3.4  Conversion of Newco Shares. Each share of common stock, par value
          --------------------------
$.01, of Newco ("Newco Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one duly issued, validly
authorized, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     3.5  Exchange of Certificates.
          ------------------------

          (a)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, an amount of cash and
certificates representing the shares of Parent Stock required to effect the
conversion of Company Shares into Parent Stock and cash in accordance with
Section 3.3.

          (b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective
Time of one or more Certificates in respect of which such holder failed to
return a properly completed Form of Election in accordance with Section 3.2(d),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates and receiving the Merger
Consideration to which such holder shall be entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.

          (c)  Upon surrender of a certificate for Company Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a proper Form of Election in
accordance with Section 3.2(d) or a duly executed letter of transmittal in
accordance with Section 3.5(b), as applicable, the holder of such certificate
for Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of shares of Parent Stock into which the
Company Shares previously

                                       10
<PAGE>

represented by such certificate are converted in accordance with Section 3.1,
the cash to which such holder is entitled in accordance with Section 3.1, and/or
the cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(e) (such shares of Parent Stock and cash are
collectively the "Aggregate Consideration"). Any cash to be received under this
Section 3.5(c) shall be in the form of a bank check. In the event that the
Aggregate Consideration is to be delivered to any person in whose name the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Aggregate Consideration may be delivered to a
transferee if the certificate for the Company Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange
Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by Section 3.2(d) or Section 3.5(b), each Certificate (other
than a Certificate representing Company Shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 3.1(g)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Aggregate
Consideration contemplated by this Section 3.1(c). No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III.

          (d)  No dividends or distributions that have been declared, if any,
will be paid to persons entitled to receive certificates for shares of Parent
Stock until such persons surrender their Certificates at which time all such
dividends and distributions shall be paid. In no event shall the persons
entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive interest on such
dividends. If any certificate for such Parent Stock is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the person requesting
such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer taxes or other taxes
required by reason of issuance in a name other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a
holder of Company Shares for any Parent Stock or dividends thereon delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

     3.6  Intentionally Deleted.
          ---------------------

     3.7  Intentionally Deleted.
          ---------------------

     3.8  Missing Certificates.
          --------------------

          (a)  If any holder of Company Shares convertible into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration is unable to deliver the Certificate which
represents such shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to such holder the
Merger Consideration to which the holder is entitled for such shares upon
presentation of the following:

               (i)  evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any
such Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed;

               (ii) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably requested by
the Parent to indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the Exchange Agent; and

                                       11
<PAGE>

               (iii) evidence satisfactory to Parent that such person is the
owner of the shares theretofore represented by each Certificate claimed to be
lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the holder is the person who would
be entitled to present such Certificate for payment pursuant to this Agreement.

          (b)  Parent shall receive any remaining Cash Consideration and Parent
Stock Consideration on deposit with the Exchange Agent on the date which is one
year after the Effective Date and any shareholder of the Company who has not
surrendered his Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent prior to such time shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration without interest upon the surrender
of such Certificate(s) to Parent, subject to applicable escheat or abandoned
property laws.

     3.9  No Further Rights or Transfers; Cancellation of Treasury Shares.
          ---------------------------------------------------------------
Except for the surrender of the certificate(s) representing the Company Shares
in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
each Share at and after the Effective Time, each holder of Company Shares shall
cease to have any rights as a shareholder of the Company, and no transfer of
Company Shares shall thereafter be made on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. Each Share held in the Company's treasury immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be canceled and
retired and cease to exist without any conversion thereof.

     3.10 Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option or other right to
          -------------
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to stock options (a "Company
Option"), whether granted by the Company under the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the
"Company Option Plan") or any other plan or agreement, which is outstanding at
the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and
become rights with respect to Parent Stock ("Parent Options"), the Company
Option Plan or any such other plan or agreement which is outstanding at the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent, and Parent shall assume each Option,

which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent
and its Compensation Committee shall be substituted for the Company and the
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (including, if applicable, the
entire Board of Directors of the Company) administering such Option Plan, (ii)
each Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent
Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to such Option shall
be equal to the number of Company Shares subject to such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Conversion Ratio, (iv) the per
share exercise price under each such Option shall be adjusted by dividing the
per share exercise price under each such Option by the Conversion Ratio and

of a share of Parent Stock upon exercise of a Parent Option and any fraction of
a share of Parent Stock that otherwise would be subject to a Parent Option shall

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom

the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any provisions of state,
local or foreign tax law. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

          ARTICLE IV -- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Newco as of
November 21, 2001 and as of the Effective Time that:

     4.1  Corporate Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
          ----------------------------------------
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.10 below) is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation and is qualified and in good standing
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased
or operated or the business conducted by it require such qualification, except
where failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.10 below) or materially
adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of the Company and its subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority
(corporate or otherwise) to own its properties and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted except where failure to have such power and authority
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended.

     4.2  Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
          --------------
of 200,000,000 Company Shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), of which, as of November 21, 2001, 8,077,413 shares
were issued and outstanding, and 900,000 Company Shares of
Convertible/Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $65.00 per share (the "Company
Preferred Stock"), of which, as of November 21, 2001, 74,243 shares were issued

<PAGE>

Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, except as otherwise provided in Section 1524(c) of the PBCL. As
of November 21, 2001, 143,250 shares of the Company Common Stock were reserved
for issuance upon exercise of outstanding awards pursuant to the Option Plan and
8,077,413 shares of the Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Rights Agreement. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2, all outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company's subsidiaries are owned by the Company
or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear
of all liens, charges, encumbrances, claims and options of any nature. Except as
set forth above and on Schedule 4.2 and except for the Company Rights, there are
not, as of the date hereof, any outstanding or authorized options, warrants,
calls, rights (including preemptive rights), commitments or any other agreements
of any character to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or
by which they may be bound, requiring it to issue, transfer, sell, purchase,
redeem or acquire any shares of capital stock or any securities or rights
convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for,
any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Except
for the Voting Agreements, there are not as of the date hereof and there will
not be at the Effective Time of the Merger any registration rights agreements,
shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company is a party or by which it is bound relating to the voting of
any Company Shares. There are no restrictions on the Company with respect to
voting the stock of any of its subsidiaries.

execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the

Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement by holders of the Company
Shares in accordance with the PBCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of Parent and Newco, constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

          (b)  The Board of Directors has duly and validly approved and taken
all corporate action required to be taken by the Board of Directors for the

affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (H) such
filings, consents, approvals, orders, registrations and declarations as may be
required as a result of the status or identity of Parent and/or Newco;

Effect; or

               (iv)   assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or

"Company Beneficiary"), or with respect to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries may have any liability ("Company Benefit Plans").

          (b)  With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has
heretofore delivered to Parent, as applicable, complete and correct copies of
each of the following documents which the Company has prepared or has been
required to prepare:

               (i)    the Company Benefit Plans and any amendments thereto (or
if a Company Benefit Plan is not a written agreement, a description thereof);

               (ii)   the three most recent annual Form 5500 reports filed with
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS");

Labor (the "DOL") pursuant to 29 U.S.C. (S) 2520.104-23;

               (xi)   any agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of its

          (c)  All contributions and other payments required to have been made

single employer with the Company under Section 414 of the Code (a "Company ERISA
Affiliate") with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (or to any person pursuant
to the terms thereof) have been or will be timely made and all such amounts
properly accrued through the date of the Company SEC Reports have been reflected
therein.

          (d)  The terms of all Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code have been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified or the applicable remedial periods will

Schedule 4.10, no event or condition exists or has occurred that could cause the
IRS to disqualify any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.10, with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company and each Company ERISA
Affiliate are in compliance in all material respects with, and each Company
Benefit Plan and related source of benefit payment is and has been operated in
compliance with, its terms, all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing
such plan or source, including, without limitation, ERISA, the Code and
applicable local law. To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in
Schedule 4.10, no Company Benefit Plan is subject to any ongoing audit,
investigation, or other administrative proceeding of the IRS, the DOL, or any
other federal, state, or local governmental entity or is scheduled to be subject
to such an audit investigation or proceeding.

          (e)  With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, to the knowledge of
the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances that could
subject the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate to any liability arising
under the Code, ERISA or any other applicable law (including, without
limitation, any liability to or under any such plan or under any indemnity
agreement to which the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate is a party), which
liability, excluding liability for benefit claims and funding obligations, each
payable in the ordinary course, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. No claim, action or litigation has been made,
commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, by or against any
Company Benefit Plan or the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan (other than for benefits in the ordinary course) that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

<PAGE>

          (f)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.10, no Company Benefit Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA)
provides benefits for any retired or former employees (other than as required
under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or
other applicable state or local law that specifically mandates continued health
coverage).

          (g)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.10, the consummation or
announcement of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement will not (either
alone or in conjunction with another event, including termination of employment)
result in (i) any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due
from the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any Company Beneficiary or to the
trustee under any "rabbi trust" or similar arrangement, or (ii) any benefit
under any Company Benefit Plan being established or increased, or becoming
accelerated, vested or payable.

          (h)  Except as described on Schedule 4.10, neither the Company nor any
entity that was at any time during the six-year period ending on November 21,
2001 a Company ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, had an obligation to
contribute to, contributed to, or had any liability with respect to any plan
that (A) is or was a pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is
or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA or (B) that is or was a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 414(f)
of the Code or Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(31) of ERISA). With respect to each
Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA,
(i) each such Company Benefit Plan uses a funding method permissible under the
Code and ERISA and the actuarial assumptions used in connection therewith are
reasonable individually and in the aggregate, (ii) no such Company Benefit Plan
has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived, and (iii)
except as otherwise disclosed on Schedule 4.10, as of the Effective Time, the
fair market value of the assets of each such Company Benefit Plan will exceed or
equal the "projected benefit obligation" (as defined in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 87) and the "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" as
defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA is zero. With respect to each Company
Benefit Plan that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, no such Company
Benefit Plan has been terminated, no filing of a notice of intent to terminate
such Company Benefit Plan has been made, and the PBGC has not initiated any
proceeding to terminate any such Company Benefit Plan. To the knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances which presents a material risk that any Company Benefit Plan has
or is likely to experience a partial termination. No assets of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries are subject to any lien under Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code.

          (i)  Except as otherwise provided in an applicable collective
bargaining agreement, each Company Benefit Plan may be terminated or modified by
the Company or Parent without material liability to the Company, Parent or any
ERISA Affiliate of either.

               (iii)   except as set forth in Schedule 5.4(a)(iii), result in a

delivered to the Company, as applicable, complete and correct copies of each of
the following documents which Parent has prepared or has been required to

person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been or will be timely made and all
such amounts properly accrued through the date of the Parent SEC Reports have
been reflected therein.

          (d)   The terms of all Parent Benefit Plans that are intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code have been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified or the applicable remedial periods will

IRS to disqualify any Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.10, with respect
to each Parent Benefit Plan, Parent and Newco and each Parent ERISA Affiliate
are in compliance in all material respects with, and each Parent Benefit Plan
and related source of benefit payment is and has been operated in compliance
with, its terms, all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such plan
or source, including, without limitation, ERISA, the Code and applicable local
law. To the knowledge of Parent or Newco, except as set forth in Schedule 5.10,

investigation or proceeding.

under the Code, ERISA or any other applicable law (including, without
limitation, any liability to or under any such plan or under any indemnity
agreement to which Parent or Newco or any Parent ERISA Affiliate is a party),
which liability, excluding liability for benefit claims and funding obligations,
each payable in the ordinary course, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Newco. No claim, action or litigation has
been made, commenced or, to the knowledge of Parent or Newco, threatened, by or
against any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent or Newco or any of its

                                       33

the ordinary course) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or Newco.

          (f)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.10, no Parent Benefit Plan that
is a "welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA)

other applicable state or local law that specifically mandates continued health
coverage).

          (g)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.10, the consummation or
announcement of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement will not (either
alone or in conjunction with another event, including termination of employment)
result in (i) any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due
from Parent or Newco or any of their subsidiaries to any Parent Beneficiary or
to the trustee under any "rabbi trust" or similar arrangement, or (ii) any
benefit under any Parent Benefit Plan being established or increased, or
becoming accelerated, vested or payable.

          (h)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.10, neither Parent nor Newco
nor any entity that was at any time during the six-year period ending on
November 21, 2001 a Parent ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, had an
obligation to contribute to, contributed to, or had any liability with respect
to any plan that (i) is or was a pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA or (ii) that is or was a multiemployer plan (as defined in
Sections 414(f) of the Code or 3(37) or 4001(a)(31) of ERISA).

subsidiary is in violation of or in default under any Law or Order, applicable

properties the effect of which, individually or in the aggregate with other such
violations and defaults could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

     6.2  Conduct of Business of Parent.
          -----------------------------

          (a)  Parent agrees that during the period from November 21, 2001 to

transaction which would require the approval of its shareholders under the PBCL
or the listing standards of Nasdaq;

or of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to the Merger);

               (iii) adopt any amendments to its Articles of Incorporation or
otherwise alter its capital structure;

               (iv)  other than in the ordinary course of business consistent

               (v)   authorize, recommend, propose or announce an intention to
do any of the foregoing, or enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or

<PAGE>

          (b)  In addition, during the period from November 21, 2001 until the

               (i)   Parent shall not amend the Co-Bank Commitment Letter or the
VoiceStream Wireless Agreement in any material respect and shall use its best
efforts to do or cause to be done all things necessary or appropriate on its
part in order to fulfill the conditions precedent set forth in the Co-Bank
Commitment Letter and the VoiceStream Wireless Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Co-Bank Commitment Letter and the VoiceStream
Wireless Agreement;

               (ii)  Parent shall maintain its current dividend policy; and

               (iii) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary, nor any executive
officer or director of Parent or any Subsidiary, nor any shareholder of Parent
who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as that term is defined for purposes of
Rules 145 and 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act) of Parent
shall purchase or sell on Nasdaq, or submit a bid to purchase or an offer to
sell on Nasdaq, directly or indirectly, any shares of Parent Common Stock or any
options, rights or other securities convertible into shares of Parent Common
Stock during the Price Determination Period.

     6.3  No Solicitation of Transactions.
          -------------------------------

          (a)  The Company agrees that, as of November 21, 2001, it has, and has
caused each officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisor or representative of the Company or any subsidiary (the
"Company Representatives"), to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Party (as
defined below) conducted heretofore with respect to any Competing Transaction
(as defined below). The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company Representatives to
(i) solicit or initiate, encourage, or facilitate, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries relating to, or the submission of, any proposal or offer, whether in
writing or otherwise, from any person other than Parent, Newco or any affiliates
thereof (a "Third Party") to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule
13(d) of the Exchange Act) of all or more than 5% of the assets of the Company
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 5% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, sale of shares of stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions, which is
structured to permit such Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership of more
than 5% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
5% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company (a "Competing
Transaction"); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any information or data with respect to or access to the
properties of, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Competing Transaction; or waive the provisions of any "standstill" or similar
agreement; or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Competing
Transaction, approve or recommend or resolve to approve or recommend any
Competing Transaction or enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                                       41
<PAGE>

               Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Company receives a
bona fide, unsolicited, written proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction by
a Third Party, which the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consulting the Board of Directors' independent financial advisor) (A) will
result in terms which are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Company Shares than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, after consultation with counsel, determines
that failure to take such action may result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable laws; and (B) is reasonably capable of being consummated
(provided that the Company, including the Board of Directors, and any of its
advisors shall be permitted to contact such Third Party and its advisors solely
for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material contingencies and
the capability of consummation) and (C) is subject to a confidentiality
agreement with such Third Party on terms no less favorable to the Company, in
all material respects, than the confidentiality agreement with Parent (each if
amended or restated a "Superior Competing Transaction"), then the Company may,
in response to an unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance with
Section 6.2(b), furnish information with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries to and participate in discussions and negotiations directly or
through its representatives with, such Third Party, provided that the Company
shall have delivered to Parent prior written notice that it intends to take such
action.

               The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to
withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, its recommendation
to the holders of the Company Shares, but only if (i) such Third Party submits
an unsolicited Competing Transaction that the Board of Directors believes, in
its good faith judgment, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Competing
Transaction and after consultation with counsel, determines that failure to take
such action may result in a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable law and
(ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent prior written notice that it
intends to take such action, including therein the identity of such Third Party
and the terms and conditions of such Superior Competing Transaction. The
Company, its officers, directors, advisors, and representatives shall
immediately cease all activities, discussions and negotiations, if any, with any
person conducted prior to the date hereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

          (b)  The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of
(i) any Competing Transaction or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Transaction received by any
officer or director of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company;
(ii) the identity of the Third Party submitting such Competing Transactions or
making such inquiry; and (iii) the material terms and conditions of such
Competing Transaction. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a
current basis of the status and details of any such Competing Transaction
(including amendments and proposed amendments) proposal or inquiry in a timely
manner.

     6.4  Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
          ------------------
provided, each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary or appropriate
waivers, consents and

                                       42
<PAGE>

approvals, to effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions
(including, but not limited to, (a) the Registration Statement (which shall be
filed as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement),
filings under the HSR Act and any other submissions requested by the PPUC, FCC,
Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice and (b) such filings,
consents, approvals, orders, registrations and declarations as may be required
under the laws of any foreign country in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries conducts any business or owns any assets) and to lift any
injunction or other legal bar to the Merger (and, in such case, to proceed with
the Merger as expeditiously as possible), subject, however, to the requisite
votes of the shareholders of any or all of the Company, Newco and Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to use its
reasonable efforts or take any action pursuant to this Section 6.4 if in the
good faith opinion of the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 6.3(a)
after consultation with its counsel such actions might be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law.

     6.5  Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, each party shall (and
          ---------------------
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives of such party
("Representatives"), in order to evaluate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties,
books and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to) furnish or make available reasonably promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested. Each party agrees that it will not,
and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant
to this Section 6.5 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The confidentiality agreements,
dated May 15, 2001 and October 24, 2001, respectively (the "Confidentiality
Agreements"), by and between the Company and Parent shall apply with respect to
information furnished by each party, its subsidiaries and its Representatives to
the other hereunder.

     6.6  Publicity. The parties will consult with each other and will mutually
          ---------
agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to the Merger
and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public
announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any agreement with any
national securities exchange or automated quotation system, in which case the
party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement
shall consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press
releases or making any such public announcements.

     6.7  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
          -----------------------------------------

          (a)  In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding
or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that

                                       43
<PAGE>

he is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise or (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree
to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and
hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of
any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time),
(A) the Company, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, promptly pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation
to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law, subject to the
provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts
so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to such
amounts, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel satisfactory to them
(except in case of a conflict of interest among two or more Indemnified Parties,
in which case more than one counsel may be retained), and the Company, and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties within 30 days after statements therefor are
received and (C) the Company and the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
assist in the defense of any such matter; provided that neither the Company nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
and provided further, that the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if, but only to the extent that, a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 6.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Company and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, thereof, provided that the failure to so notify
shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Surviving Corporation
except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

          (b)  Parent and Newco agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal
liability of, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and
the subsidiaries of the Company in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Company as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective
Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claims (each, a "Claim") asserted or

                                       44
<PAGE>

made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Claim. For
a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in
effect the existing directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
insurance policies with an amount of coverage not less than 100% of the amount
of existing coverage, or policies that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Parties, and with an amount of coverage not less than 100% of the amount of
existing coverage, than the policies which are currently maintained by the
Company, with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time, so long as such policies are available for an
annual premium which is no more than 200% of the current annual premium for the
existing policies; provided, that if such policies are not available for an
annual premium of no more than 200% of the current annual premium, then policies
in an amount and scope as great as can be obtained for an annual premium of 200%
of the current annual premium shall be obtained.

          (c)  This Section 6.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and
to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 6.7.

          (d)  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets
to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.7.

          (e)  To the extent permitted by law, all rights of indemnification for
the benefit of any Indemnified Party shall be mandatory rather than permissive.

     6.8  Employees.
          ---------

          (a)  Following the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its successors: (A) to satisfy each of the agreements
and arrangements (the "Employment Obligations") described in subsection (c)
below with respect to the employees (the "Contract Employees") subject to such
agreements and arrangements, (B) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
retain each present full-time employee of the Company at such employee's current
position with such current responsibilities (or, if offered to, and accepted by,
an employee, a position for which the employee is qualified with the Surviving
Corporation or Parent at a salary commensurate with the position), (C) pay
compensation to each person who was employed as of the Effective Time and who
continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or Parent on and after the
Effective Time, that is at least equal to the aggregate compensation that such
person was receiving from the Company prior to the Effective Time (unless there
is a material change in the duties and responsibilities of such employee), (ii)
in the event that Parent continues or causes the Surviving Corporation to
continue to employ officers or employees of the Company as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent or their successors shall employ such
persons on the Effective Time who are not Contract Employees as "at will"
employees, (iii) officers and employees of the Company who continue

                                       45
<PAGE>

employment with the Surviving Corporation or Parent or their successors after
the Effective Time and who are Contract Employees will be employed pursuant to
the terms and conditions of their respective Employment Obligations, and (iv) in
the event the Surviving Corporation or Parent or their successors do not employ,
or terminate the employment (other than as a result of unsatisfactory
performance of their respective duties or for cause) of any officers or
employees of the Company as of the Effective Time who are not Contract
Employees, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their
successors to pay the following severance benefits to such employees: a minimum
of 2 weeks' salary, with an additional one week for each year of service, with a
maximum of 26 weeks' salary.

          (b)  Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees (i) to provide
employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies for the benefit of
current retired employees and current retired non-employee directors (each as of
the date hereof) of the Company and its subsidiaries that in the aggregate are
no less favorable to such retired employees and retired non-employee directors
than the Company Plans and (ii) to allow future retired non-employee directors
(including any spouse or surviving spouse thereof) to participate in an
applicable health and welfare plan, provided that all expenses associated with
such participation shall be the sole responsibility of such retired non-employee
directors (or, as applicable, a spouse or surviving spouse thereof). For a
period of two (2) years following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide
employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies for the benefit of
employees and future retired employees (i.e., employees who retire after the
date hereof) of the Company and its subsidiaries that in the aggregate are no
less favorable to such employees and future retired employees than the Company
Plans. In the case of benefit plans and programs under which benefits are paid
or determined by reference to the value of Company Shares, Parent agrees that
such benefits shall be paid or determined by reference to the value of shares of
common stock of Parent in an equitable manner. All service credited to each
employee and retired employee by the Company through the Effective Time shall be
recognized by Parent for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit
accruals) under the Parent Benefit Plans. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall not treat any Company employee as a "new" employee or retired employee for
purposes of any pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements or similar provision under any health or other welfare
plan, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s), to the extent applicable, to ensure
such result.

          (c)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree to honor
(without modification) and assume the employment agreements, executive
termination agreements and individual benefit arrangements listed on Schedule
6.8(c) (except to the extent that such agreements have been waived prior to the
Effective Time), all as in effect at the Effective Time.

     6.9  Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement.
          ---------------------------------------------

          (a)  As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
(i) Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a Joint Proxy
Statement (the "Joint Proxy Statement"), and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (together with all amendments
thereto, the "Registration Statement") in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall
be included as a prospectus in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the
shareholders of the

                                       46
<PAGE>

Company pursuant to the Merger. Parent and the Company shall each use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as promptly as practicable, and, prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, Parent shall take all or any action required under any
applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. In connection with the
preparation of the Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement, the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company as Parent may reasonably
request, and Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent as the
Company may reasonably request. As promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement shall have become effective, each of Parent and the
Company shall mail the Joint Proxy Statement to its respective shareholders.

          (b)  Subject to Section 6.3, the Joint Proxy Statement shall include
the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to the
shareholders of the Company in favor of Company Shareholder Approval;
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, modify or amend its
recommendation if in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, arrived
at in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3(a), after consultation with
counsel, such recommendation might be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company's shareholders under applicable law; and any such withholding,
withdrawal, modification or amendment shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement.

          (c)  The Joint Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent to the shareholders of Parent
in favor of Parent Shareholder Approval.

          (d)  Except as may be required by law, no amendment or supplement to
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by Parent
or the Company without the approval of the other party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent and the Company each will advise the
other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification
of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon or requests
for additional information by the SEC.

          (e)  Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the Nasdaq a listing
application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock,
subject to official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with
Parent with respect to such listing.

     6.10 Shareholders' Approvals.
          -----------------------

          (a)  The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the PBCL, any other applicable
law and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, promptly and duly call, give
notice of, and convene and hold as soon as practicable following the date upon
which the Registration Statement becomes effective the

                                       47
<PAGE>

meeting of the Company's shareholders (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval.

          (b)  Parent, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the PBCL, any other applicable
law and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, promptly and duly call, give
notice of, and convene and hold as soon as practicable following the date upon
which the Registration Statement becomes effective the meeting of Parent's
shareholders (the "Parent Shareholders Meeting," together with any Company
Shareholders Meeting, the "Shareholders Meetings") for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Shareholder Approval.

          (c)  Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to solicit from their respective shareholders proxies in favor of such
approvals, and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of shareholders required by the PBCL or the Nasdaq, as
applicable, to obtain such approvals, in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement unless, in the good faith opinion of the Company's Board of Directors,
arrived at in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3(a), after
consultation with its counsel, obtaining such approvals might be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law.

     6.11 Tax Matters. The parties acknowledge their respective desire to
          -----------
structure the Merger to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company will use their reasonable
good faith efforts to achieve such tax treatment. If based upon the
Reorganization Assumption, the fair market value (determined as of the Effective
Time) of the Stock Consideration provided in the Merger would be at least 40% of
the fair market value of the total consideration received by the holders of the
Company Shares pursuant to the Merger, Parent shall (subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions to the issuance of the Tax Opinion (defined below) in the
immediately following sentence) deliver to the Company an opinion of Morgan,
Lewis & Bockius LLP, special counsel to Parent, (or such other tax counsel
reasonably agreed to by the parties) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "E"
(the "Tax Opinion") to the effect that, for federal income tax purposes: (a) the
Merger will be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code; (b) neither the Company, Parent nor Newco will recognize any gain or loss
upon consummation of the Merger; (c) a Company shareholder will not recognize
any gain or loss upon the exchange of Company Shares solely for shares of Parent
Stock in the Merger; (d) a Company shareholder who receives cash and shares of
Parent Stock in exchange for Company Shares in the Merger will recognize any
gain realized (including any gain treated as a dividend) up to the amount of
cash received, but will not recognize any loss; and (e) a Company shareholder
who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock would recognize
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such cash. The issuance of the Tax
Opinion shall be conditioned on (i) the reasonable opinion of such tax counsel
(or other tax counsel reasonably agreed to by the parties) that the Tax Opinion
can be given and (ii) the receipt by such tax counsel of representation letters
from each of the Company, Parent, and Newco, in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. The specific provisions
of each such representation letter shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such tax counsel, and each such representation letter shall be
dated on or before the date of such opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or
modified in any material respect. Each of the Company and Parent covenant and
agree to use

                                       48
<PAGE>

reasonable best efforts to provide such representation letters in substantially
the same form as Exhibit F and G. For purposes of this Agreement the term
"Reorganization Assumption" shall mean the following assumption: the fair market
value of Parent Common Stock as of the Effective Time is equal to the closing
price of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq at the end of the trading day immediately
preceding the Effective Time of the Merger.

     6.12 Sale of the Company's Wireless Operations. Parent and the Company
          -----------------------------------------
shall cooperate and use their best efforts to enter into an agreement with an
appropriate third party to sell the Company's wireless operations (pursuant to a
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such operations) on terms and
conditions acceptable to Parent and the Company, the consummation of such sale
being contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

     8.2  Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be

prior to the Effective Time, if (a) the Company shall have failed to perform in
any material respect any of its material obligations under this Agreement to be

or is incapable of being cured, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company

funds, such amount to constitute liquidated (and exclusive) damages for the
breach or breaches giving rise to such termination.
