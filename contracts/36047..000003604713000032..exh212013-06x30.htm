No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the Closing is

prepared in reasonable detail, reflecting (a) Sellers\' good faith estimates
of the Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital") and the
Closing Net Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness"), each
determined in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement applicable
thereto and the Accounting Policies applied in a manner consistent with the
application of such policies in the calculation of the Target Working Capital
(as described in Exhibit B), and (b) Sellers\' calculation of the estimated
Purchase Price, calculated in accordance with the definition thereof.





2.9. Closing Working Capital and Closing Net Indebtedness.

(a)Closing Statement. As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, Buyers will cause to be prepared and delivered to
Sellers a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth (i) Buyers\'
calculation of the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Net Indebtedness,
each determined in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement
applicable thereto and the Accounting Policies applied in a manner consistent
with the application 

of such policies in the calculation of the Target Working Capital (as
described in Exhibit B), and (ii) Buyers\' calculation of the Purchase Price,
calculated in accordance with the definition thereof.

(b)Notice of Disagreement. If Sellers disagree with Buyers\' calculation of
the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net Indebtedness, and/or the Purchase
Price delivered pursuant to Section 2.9(a), Sellers may, within forty-five
(45) days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice to
Buyers disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Sellers\'
calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement will specify those
items or amounts as to which Sellers disagree, and Sellers will be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement. If Sellers fail to deliver such written notice within such forty-
five (45)-day period, Buyers\' calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the
Closing Net Indebtedness, and the Purchase Price will be final and binding
upon the parties.

(c)Disputes. If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.9(b), Sellers and Buyers will, for a period of thirty (30) days following
the delivery of such notice (or such longer period as each of Sellers and
Buyers may mutually agree in writing), use commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
amount of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net Indebtedness, and/or
the Purchase Price, as applicable. If, upon the conclusion of such period, or
any mutually-agreed extension thereof, Sellers and Buyers are unable to reach
such agreement, they will promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Independent Accounting Firm
will review this Section 2.9, the definitions of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Net Indebtedness, and/or the Purchase Price, as applicable, and the
defined terms used in this Agreement, and the disputed items or amounts for
the purpose of calculating the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net
Indebtedness, and/or the Purchase Price, as applicable. In making such
calculation, the Independent Accounting Firm will consider only those items or
amounts in Buyers\' calculation of the Closing Working Capital and/or the
Closing Net Indebtedness, as applicable, subject to dispute. The scope of the
disputes to be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm will be limited
to (i) whether the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net
Indebtedness, and/or the Purchase Price was determined in accordance with the
definitions in this Agreement applicable thereto and (with respect to Closing
Working Capital and Closing Net Indebtedness) the Accounting Policies applied
in a manner consistent with the application of such policies in the
calculation of the Target Working Capital (as described in Exhibit B) and (ii)
whether there were mathematical errors in calculation of the Closing Working
Capital, the Closing Net Indebtedness, and/or the Purchase Price. The
Independent Accounting Firm will be instructed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to perform its services within thirty (30) days of submission of the
dispute to it and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after such
submission. The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Sellers and Buyers
as promptly as practicable, and will be instructed to deliver no later than
thirty (30) days after its engagement, a written report setting forth such
calculation. Such report will be final and binding upon Sellers and Buyers
(absent a manifest error). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm will be borne pro rata as between Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, based on the proportionate deviation of the respective
adjustment amounts proposed by Buyers and Sellers, as set forth in the Closing
Statement in the case of Buyers and the notice of disagreement in the case of
Sellers, from the determination of the final adjustment amounts made by the
Independent Accounting Firm, as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm.
"Independent Accounting Firm" means a mutually acceptable nationally
recognized firm of independent certified public accountants that has not
provided services to either Sellers and their Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Companies) 

or Buyers and their Subsidiaries in the preceding two (2) years, or, if no
such firm is available and willing to serve, then a mutually acceptable expert
in public accounting, in each case upon which Buyers and Sellers will have
mutually agreed; provided, that if Buyers and Sellers are unable to select
such firm or expert within sixty (60) days after delivery of written notice of
a disagreement, either Buyers or Sellers may request the American Arbitration
Association to appoint, within twenty (20) Business Days from the date of such
request, an independent accounting firm meeting the requirements set forth
above or a neutral and impartial certified public accountant with significant
arbitration experience related to purchase price adjustment disputes relating
to transactions of a similar nature.

(d)Cooperation. Buyers and Sellers agree that they will, and agree to cause
their respective Subsidiaries and respective independent accountants to,
reasonably cooperate and assist in the preparation and review of the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Net
Indebtedness, and the Purchase Price, including making available books,
records, work papers, and personnel as reasonably requested.

(e)Purchase Price Adjustment. If the applicable adjustments referred to in
Sections 2.10(a) through 2.10(d) above result in a net increase in the
Purchase Price, the amount of such increase is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Purchase Price Increase". If the applicable adjustments referred to in
Sections 2.10(a) through 2.10(d) above result in a net reduction in the
Purchase Price, the amount of such reduction is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Purchase Price Reduction".

and the Final Closing Net Indebtedness:

(i)If there exists a Purchase Price Reduction, Sellers will pay, or cause to
be paid, to Buyers (or as directed by Buyers) an amount equal to the Purchase
Price Reduction, in immediately available funds to an account identified by
Buyers in writing to Sellers; provided, that in the event that Sellers fail to
pay all or any portion of the Purchase Price Reduction within such five
(5)-Business Day period, Buyers will have the right, but not the obligation,
to recover such unpaid amount from the Escrow Amount; and

(ii)If there exists a Purchase Price Increase, Buyers will, and Buyer
Guarantor will cause Buyers to, pay or cause to be paid to Sellers (or as
directed by Sellers) an amount equal to the Purchase Price Increase, in

non-disclosure agreements, and (B) non-exclusive licenses with respect to

as the "Business License Agreements"). None of Sellers or the Transferred
Companies has entered into any Contractual Obligation with respect to any
material Business Intellectual Property Rights that prevents, or, after the

Rights of any Person in any material respect or constitute unfair competition
or trade practices under the applicable Law of any jurisdiction. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.12(d), since January 4, 2011, neither Sellers nor any of
the Transferred Companies have received written notice from any Person (i)
requesting 

that Sellers or any of the Transferred Companies take a license under the
Intellectual Property Rights of a third Person or (ii) claiming that the
operation of the Business by Sellers or any of the Transferred Companies,
infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person or
constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the applicable Law of
any jurisdiction.

Intellectual Property Rights are subject to any Proceeding or outstanding

receives any correspondence or communication that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, they will
promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, give notice thereof
(including the material terms thereof) to Buyers.



5.5. Notices and Consents.

(a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
will not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, or convey any
Transferred DQ Valuation Business Contract or other DQ Valuation Business
Asset or Luxco IP Asset, or any claim, right, or benefit arising under, or
resulting from, such Transferred DQ Valuation Business Contract or other DQ
Valuation Business Asset or Luxco IP Asset, to Buyers, if a sale, assignment,
transfer, or conveyance thereof to Buyers would constitute a material breach
or contravention of the rights of a third party thereunder (such assets being
collectively referred to in this Agreement as "Restricted Assets", and such
contracts being collectively referred to in this Agreement as "Restricted
Contracts").

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless and
until the applicable consents with respect to any Restricted Asset or
Restricted Contract are obtained, such Restricted Asset or Restricted Contract
will not constitute a DQ Valuation Business Asset or IP Asset, and any
Liability with respect to such Restricted Asset or Restricted Contract will
not constitute a Transferred Liability, for any purpose under this Agreement.
Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, all requisite consents (the "Required Consents") to (i) the
sale, transfer, and assignment on the Closing Date of the Restricted Assets
and Restricted Contracts, and (ii) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any contracts to which the Transferred Companies are party or
under which the Transferred Companies or their assets may be bound that
require consent in connection with such transactions; provided, that neither
Sellers, nor Buyers, nor any of their respective Affiliates will be required
to grant any additional consideration to any third party, provide additional
material security (including a guaranty, other than a guaranty from Buyers or
their Affiliates replacing an existing guaranty by any of Sellers or their
Affiliates), or incur any additional costs in order to obtain any Required
Consent (except, in each case, for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to the
extent incurred in performing the actions and procedures set forth in this
Section 5.5(b)).

(c)In the event that Sellers determine to seek novation with respect to any
Transferred DQ Valuation Business Contract to be assigned hereunder, Buyers
will reasonably cooperate with Sellers (including, where necessary, entering
into appropriate instruments of assumption) to cause such novation to be
obtained and to have Sellers released from all liability to third parties with
respect to such Transferred 

DQ Valuation Business Contract. Additionally, Sellers and Buyers will use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing, novation of each of the guarantees by Stock Seller of (i) the
Transferred Companies\' obligations under the Contractual Obligations set
forth on Schedule 5.5(c) and (ii) the obligations under the Transferred DQ
Valuation Business Contracts set forth on Schedule 5.5(c).

(d)If any Required Consent with respect to a Restricted Asset or Restricted
Contract is not obtained prior to the Closing, for a period of three (3)
months after the Closing Date, the parties hereto will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly the
Required Consents; provided, that neither Sellers, nor Buyers, nor any of
their respective Affiliates will be required to grant any additional
consideration to any third party, provide additional material security
(including a guaranty, other than a guaranty from Buyers or their Affiliates
replacing an existing guaranty by any of Sellers or their Affiliates), or
incur any additional costs in order to obtain any Required Consent (except, in
each case, for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to the extent incurred in
performing the actions and procedures set forth in this Section 5.5(d)).
Pending the earlier of obtaining such Required Consents and the expiration of
such three (3)-month period, the parties hereto will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other with respect to the underlying
rights and obligations in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to
permit Buyers to perform the obligations of Sellers thereunder, as a
subcontractor, supplier, customer, or otherwise, and as will permit Buyers to
obtain the benefit thereof (the "Subcontracted Work"). Buyers agree to
diligently perform and discharge the obligations of Sellers in connection with
the Subcontracted Work, directly or indirectly, as applicable, through
Sellers, and Sellers agree to enforce, at Buyers\' request and for Buyers\'
account, any and all rights arising under any such Restricted Contract or
Restricted Asset. To the extent that Required Consents with respect to a
particular Restricted Asset or Restricted Contract are obtained after the
Closing, Sellers and Buyers hereby agree that such obligations will no longer
be considered to be Subcontracted Work at such time, the Restricted Asset or
Restricted Contract will be deemed a DQ Valuation Business Asset or IP Asset,
as applicable, hereunder and will automatically be assigned to Buyers upon the
receipt of the applicable consent without any further action by the parties
hereto. If any Required Consent with respect to a particular Restricted Asset
or Restricted Covenant is not obtained after such three (3)-month period, the
parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other to amend the Transition Services Agreement to provide such Restricted
Asset or Restricted Contract at the expiration of the three (3)-month period.

(e)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, so long as
Buyers are obtaining the benefit of any Restricted Asset or Restricted
Contract in accordance with Section 5.5(d), the failure to obtain any consent,
release, or transfer with respect to such Restricted Asset or Restricted
Contract, the failure of such Restricted Asset or Restricted Contract to
constitute a Transferred Asset, or any circumstances resulting therefrom, will
not (i) constitute a Material Adverse Effect or a breach by any of Sellers of
any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement under this Agreement or
by any of Sellers and their applicable Subsidiaries of the Ancillary Documents
or (ii) constitute a failure of any condition under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents.

5.6. Identification of At Will Material Contracts Requiring Consent.



Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyers,
by no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, a
schedule setting forth all At Will Material Contracts with respect to which
the execution, delivery, and performance by Sellers of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents required to be executed and delivered by Sellers and their
applicable Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Companies), and the
consummation by Sellers and such Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents would (with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both) violate, conflict with, or constitute a default under,
result in the termination, breach, or impairment 

of or a loss of benefit under, accelerate the performance required by, require
any consent, notice, or action by any Person under, or create in any Person
the right to accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel any term or provision of
such At Will Material Contract to which any of Sellers or such Subsidiaries is
a party, or by which any of Sellers or such Subsidiaries, or any of the
Business\'s material assets, may be bound or subject.



5.7. Post-Closing Access; Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition.

(a)Access to Sellers. Following the Closing, upon reasonable advance notice,
Buyers will allow Sellers and their counsel, financial advisors, auditors, and
other authorized representatives reasonable access to the Transferred DQ
Valuation Business Records and the books and records of the Transferred
Companies, and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or
contents of the Transferred DQ Valuation Business Records and the books and
records of the Transferred Companies, for legitimate and specified business
reasons, such as the preparation of financial statements or Tax Returns or the
defense of litigation, in each case to the extent relating to the Business
prior to the Closing; provided, that any access or furnishing of information
must be conducted at Sellers\' expense during normal business hours, under the
supervision of Buyers\' personnel, and in such a manner as to not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of Buyers, their Subsidiaries, and their
business. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) none
of Sellers, nor any of their counsel, financial advisors, auditors, or other
authorized representatives, may have access to personnel records included in
the Transferred DQ Valuation Business Records or the books and records of the
Transferred Companies relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories, or other information in personnel records to the
extent that providing such access would constitute a breach of Law by any of
Buyers or their Affiliates, and (ii) Buyers will not be required to disclose
to Sellers or their counsel, financial advisors, auditors, or other authorized
representatives reasonable access, any information (A) if doing so would
violate any Contractual Obligation or applicable Law to which any of Buyers or
their Affiliates is a party or is subject or (B) if Buyers believe in good
faith based on advice of counsel that doing so would jeopardize the ability to
assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product
privileges); provided, that in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii)(A)
immediately above, Buyers must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
for the maximum access possible without violation of the applicable
Contractual Obligation or Law. Buyers will be entitled to recover from Sellers
their reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including copying costs) incurred in
providing such books and records and/or personnel to Sellers. In furtherance
of Sellers\' rights under this Section 5.7(a), for a period of one (1) year
after the Closing Date, Buyers will preserve the Transferred DQ Valuation
Business Records, and the material books and records of the Transferred
Companies as in existence at the Closing.

(b)Access to Buyers. Following the Closing, upon reasonable advance notice,
Sellers will, and will cause their Subsidiaries to, allow Buyers and their
counsel, financial advisors, auditors, and other authorized representatives
reasonable access to all books, documents, and records of Sellers that relate
primarily to the Business and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts
and/or contents of such books and records, for legitimate and specified
business reasons, such as the preparation of financial statements or Tax
Returns or the defense of litigation, in each case to the extent relating to
the Business after the Closing; provided, that any access or furnishing of
information must be conducted at Buyers\' expense during normal business
hours, under the supervision of Sellers\' personnel, and in such a manner as
to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of Sellers, their
Subsidiaries, and their businesses. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (i) neither any of Buyers nor any of their counsel, financial
advisors, auditors, or other authorized representatives reasonable access may
have access to personnel records included in such books and records relating
to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories, or other
information in personnel records to the extent that providing such access
would constitute a breach of Law by any of Sellers or their Affiliates, and
(ii) none of Sellers will be required to 

disclose to Buyers, or their counsel, financial advisors, auditors, or other
authorized representatives reasonable access, any information (A) if doing so
would violate any contract or applicable Law to which any of Sellers or their
Affiliates is a party or is subject or (B) any of Sellers believes in good
faith based on advice of counsel that doing so would jeopardize the ability to
assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and work product
privileges); provided, that in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii)(A)
immediately above, Sellers must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
for the maximum access possible without violation of the applicable
Contractual Obligation or Law. Sellers will be entitled to recover from Buyers
their reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including copying costs) incurred in
providing such books and records and/or personnel to Buyers.

(c)Confidentiality Obligation of Sellers and Parent LP. For a period of three
(3) years after the Closing Date, Sellers and Parent LP will, and will cause
their Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and representatives to,
treat and hold as confidential any information to the extent concerning the
Business (the "Confidential Information"), and refrain from using or
disclosing any of the Confidential Information (i) except as required in
performing its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
and consummating the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, enforcing
their rights in respect hereof or thereof, preparing and filing financial
statements or Tax Returns, reporting to lenders or investors, or as reasonably
necessary with respect to the prosecution or defense of any audit or other
legal or regulatory Proceeding that is then pending or threatened, and (ii)
unless, and only to the extent that, such disclosure is, on the advice of
Sellers\' legal counsel, required by applicable Law. In the event that any of
Sellers, Parent LP, or any of their Subsidiaries is requested or required (by
oral question or request for information or documents in any Proceeding) to
disclose any Confidential Information, it will notify Buyers promptly of the
request or requirement so that Buyers may seek an appropriate protective order
or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.7(c). If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any of
Sellers, Parent LP, or any of their Subsidiaries is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any Governmental
Authority or tribunal, then such Seller, Parent LP, or such Subsidiary may
disclose the minimum amount of Confidential Information necessary to satisfy
the mandates of such the Governmental Authority or tribunal. The limitations
upon disclosure set forth in this Section 5.7(c) do not apply to information
that is publicly known at the Closing, or becomes publicly known or available
after the Closing, in each case except by means in violation of this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, or any other duty owed to Buyers by
Sellers or their Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.7(c)
will not apply to any information shared by the parties to an Ancillary
Document pursuant to, and that is the subject of the confidentiality
provisions of, such Ancillary Document.

(d)Confidentiality Obligation of Buyers and Buyer Guarantor. Buyers and Buyer
Guarantor will, and will cause their Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees, and representatives to, treat all non-public information obtained
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
by reference, and will continue in full force and effect for a period of three
(3) years after the Closing Date; provided, that the applicability of the
Confidentiality Agreement to non-public information to the extent concerning
exclusively the Business will terminate at the Closing. If this Agreement is,
for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
will continue in full force and effect as provided in Section 7.2 (Effect of
Termination) in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement\'s terms. For
the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.7(d) will not apply to any information
shared by the parties to an Ancillary Document pursuant to, and that is the
subject of the confidentiality provisions of, such Ancillary Document.

(e)Non-Solicitation Obligation of Sellers and Parent LP. For a period of two
(2) years after the Closing Date, Sellers and Parent LP will not, and will not
cause or permit their respective Subsidiaries 

to, either directly or indirectly, (i) hire any employee of the Transferred
Companies or any Hired DQ Valuation Business Employee or (ii) solicit,
influence, entice, or encourage, or assist any other Person in the
solicitation, influencing, enticement, or encouraging of, any employee of the
Transferred Companies or any Hired DQ Valuation Business Employee to cease or
curtail his or her relationship with any of Buyers or their Affiliates;
provided, that nothing in this Section 5.7(e) will restrict or preclude any of
Sellers, Parent LP, or their respective Subsidiaries from (i) making
generalized searches for, and hiring, employees by the use of advertisements
in the media (including trade media) or (ii) soliciting and hiring any
employee of the Transferred Companies or any Hired DQ Valuation Business
Employee at any time on or after ninety (90) days from the date on which he or
she has left employment with any of Buyers or their Affiliates (other than as
a result of a breach by Sellers or Parent LP of this Section 5.7(e)).

(f)Non-Solicitation Obligation of Buyers and Buyer Guarantor. For a period of
two (2) years after the Closing Date, Buyers and Buyer Guarantor will not, and
will not cause or permit their respective Subsidiaries to, either directly or
indirectly, (i) hire any employee of any of the Excluded Businesses set forth
on Schedule 5.7(f) or (ii) solicit, influence, entice, or encourage, or assist
any other Person in the solicitation, influencing, enticement, or encouraging
of, any such employee to cease or curtail his or her relationship with any of
Sellers, Parent LP, or their respective Affiliates; provided, that nothing in
this Section 5.7(f) will restrict or preclude any of Buyers, Buyer Guarantor
or their respective Subsidiaries from (i) making generalized searches for, and
hiring, employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade
media) or (ii) soliciting and hiring any such employee at any time on or after
ninety (90) days from the date on which he or she has left employment with any
of Sellers or their respective Affiliates (other than as a result of a breach
by Buyers or Buyer Guarantor of this Section 5.7(f)).

(g)Non-Competition Obligation of Sellers and Parent LP. For a period of three
(3) years after the Closing Date, Sellers and Parent LP will not, and will not
cause or permit their Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, engage in,
carry on, provide services in connection with, or otherwise assist with any
Competing Activities within the Restricted Territory, including by (i)
agreeing to provide, or causing any of their officers, directors, or employees
to provide, advisory services to any Person that engages in any Competing
Activities, (ii) having any interest (as an owner, consultant, partner,
principal, agent, representative, or otherwise), in any Person that engages,
directly or indirectly, in any Competing Activities, (iii) causing, inducing,
encouraging, or assisting any other Person in the inducement or encouragement
of, any client, customer, supplier, or licensor of the Business, or any other
Person who has a material business relationship with the Business, to
terminate or materially modify to the detriment of the Business any such
actual relationship, or (iv) making active preparations for any Competing
Activities; provided, that none of the following will be deemed to constitute
a violation of this Section 5.7(g): (A) ownership of less than 2% of the
outstanding equity interests of any publicly-traded company, (B) performance
by any of Sellers, Parent LP or their respective Subsidiaries, agents, or
representatives of its obligations under the Ancillary Documents in accordance
with the terms thereof, (C) conduct of the Excluded Businesses as they are
conducted on the date of this Agreement, or (D) conduct by any purchaser of
the Excluded Businesses of any activities that (x) are within the lines of
business of such purchaser as they are conducted prior to the purchase of the
Excluded Businesses and/or (y) are within the lines of business of the
Excluded Businesses as they are conducted on the date of this Agreement
(including any activities that are within lines of business that arise from
the ordinary course combination or integration of the lines of business of
such purchaser\'s businesses as they are conducted prior to the purchase of
the Excluded Businesses and the lines of business of the Excluded Businesses
as they are conducted on the date of this Agreement).

(h)Special Remedies. Each of Sellers and Parent LP, on the one hand, and each
of Buyers and Buyer Guarantor, on the other hand, agrees that any breach or
threatened breach of this Section 5.7 would give rise to irreparable harm to
Buyers or Sellers, respectively, for which monetary damages would not be 

an adequate remedy. Each of Sellers and Parent LP, on the one hand, and Buyers
and Buyer Guarantor, on the other hand, hereby agrees that in the event of a
breach or threatened breach by any of them or their respective Subsidiaries of
any of their obligations under this Section 5.7, the other party will be, in
addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to the
other party in respect of such breach, entitled to equitable relief, including
a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any
other relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction
(without any requirement to post bond). The parties to this Agreement agree
that the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.7 are reasonable,
appropriate, and narrowly-tailored, but that if a court of competent
jurisdiction finds this Section 5.7 more restrictive than permitted by the
Laws of any jurisdiction in which any of Buyers or any of Sellers seeks
enforcement hereof, this Section 5.7 will be limited to the extent required to
permit maximum enforcement thereof under such Laws. In particular, the parties
intend that the covenants contained in the previous portions of this Section
5.7 will be construed as a series of separate covenants, including one for
each county in each state or territory in the Restricted Territory. Except for
geographic coverage, each such separate covenant will be deemed identical in
terms. If, in any Proceeding, a court of competent jurisdiction refuses to
enforce any of the separate covenants deemed included in this Section 5.7,
then only such unenforceable covenant will be deemed eliminated from these
provisions for the purposes of the Proceeding to the extent necessary to
permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced. In addition, if a
court of competent jurisdiction refuses to enforce any of the covenants
throughout the full length of the applicable covenant\'s term, the parties
agree that such covenant\'s term will be deemed amended to the longest period
that is permissible. This Section 5.7(h) is in addition to, and not in
limitation of, Section 9.1 (Specific Performance).

5.8. Solicited DQ Valuation Business Employees.



Schedule 5.8 lists all DQ Valuation Business Employees who will be offered
employment by any of Buyers or their Affiliates, as provided in this Agreement
(such persons, the "Solicited DQ Valuation Business Employees"). At least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any of Buyer or their Affiliates
will make an offer of employment, to be effective as of the Closing, subject
to each employee\'s successful completion of Buyers\' customary pre-employment
screening requirements, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to each
Solicited DQ Valuation Business Employee, and such Solicited DQ Valuation
Business Employee may either accept such offers of employment (any Solicited
DQ Valuation Business Employee who accepts such offer and becomes employed by
any of Buyer or their Affiliates is referred to in this Agreement as a "Hired
DQ Valuation Business Employee"), or reject such offer of employment, in the
Solicited DQ Valuation Business Employee\'s sole discretion. Sellers will be
responsible for (a) all obligations and liabilities from and after the Closing
that relate to the Solicited DQ Valuation Business Employees who do not become
Hired DQ Valuation Business Employees pursuant to this Section 5.8 and (b)
terminating the employment of all Hired DQ Valuation Business Employees
immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with all applicable Law.
Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to assist any of Buyers
or their Affiliates in its efforts to secure employment arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Buyers with the Solicited DQ Valuation Business
Employees, provided such employment arrangements are consistent with the
requirements of this Agreement.



5.9. Post-Closing Employee Covenants.

(a)Employment Terms and Benefits. Effective as of the Closing, each Hired DQ
Valuation Business Employee will cease to be a DQ Valuation Business Employee,
and will cease to actively participate in any employee benefit plan, program,
or arrangement maintained by any of Sellers or their Subsidiaries. From the
Closing through the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date, or an
earlier date of termination of employment, if applicable, Buyers will, or will
cause their Subsidiaries to, provide each Continuing Employee with a base
salary or wage level, bonus opportunity, and benefits, perquisites, and 

other terms and conditions of employment that are substantially similar in the
aggregate than those to which he or she was entitled as of the date of this
Agreement (but, in the case of each, excluding equity-based compensation and
benefits); provided, that nothing contained in this Agreement precludes, or
may be construed as precluding, any of Buyers or their Affiliates, in their
sole discretion, from (i) changing the title, compensation, or benefits of any
Continuing Employees (or any other Person) (so long as the comparability
standard contained in this Section 5.9(a) is otherwise met) or (ii)
terminating, at any time after the Closing, any Continuing Employees (or any
other Person); provided, further, that Buyers or their Affiliates, as
applicable, will provide each Continuing Employee with terms and conditions of
employment sufficient to avoid Seller, or any of its Affiliates, from
incurring liability under any Worker Notification Law as a result of any loss
of employment (whether actual or constructive) experienced by the Continuing
Employee.

(b)Transferred Companies Plans. Buyers agree to honor, and to cause their
Affiliates to honor, the obligations of the Transferred Companies under the
provisions of each Transferred Companies Plan set forth in Section 3.11;
provided, that nothing in this Agreement will require Buyers to continue to
maintain the Transferred Companies Plans for any specific period of time, or
will prevent Buyers from amending or terminating any such Transferred
Companies Plans at any time.

(c)Buyer Benefit Plans. Buyers will, or will cause their Affiliates to, credit
all service of the Continuing Employees with any of Sellers or the Transferred
Companies, or any predecessor entities thereto, prior to the Closing for
purposes of participation, level of benefits, coverage, and vesting, but not
for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) under the
employee benefit plans of Buyers or their Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer
Benefit Plans") in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing; provided, that no such past service credit will
be granted to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the
same period of service. On or before the Closing, Sellers will provide Buyers
with a schedule of the time of service to be credited to each of the
Continuing Employees. Buyers will use commercially reasonable efforts (subject
to any required consent of any insurance provider with respect to any fully-
insured plans) to cause such Buyer Benefit Plans to provide credit for any co-
payments or deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the
Continuing Employees under the corresponding Seller Plan during the plan year
in which the Closing occurs and waive all pre-existing condition exclusions
and waiting periods, other than to the extent of limitations or waiting
periods that had not been satisfied under the corresponding Seller Plan. On or
before the Closing Date, Sellers will provide Buyers with a schedule with the
amount of co-payments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket payments to be credited
to each of the Continuing Employees.

(d)Paid Time Off. Effective as of the Closing, Buyers will, or will cause
their Affiliates to, assume or retain, as the case may be, in accordance with,
and to the extent permitted by, applicable Law, all obligations of Sellers for
the accrued, unused paid time off of the Hired DQ Valuation Business
Employees. If any accrued, unused paid time off of the Hired DQ Valuation
Business Employees may not be assumed or retained under applicable Law,
Sellers will be responsible for paying any such accrued and unused paid time
off in accordance with the amounts set forth on Schedule 5.9(d), as updated
through the Closing Date, and any such amounts paid by Sellers will be
promptly (and, in any case, within five (5) Business Days of the payment
thereof) reimbursed by Buyers to Sellers.

(e)Seller Benefit Plans. Except for the Transferred Companies Plans, none of
Buyers nor any of their Affiliates (i) will contribute to any Benefit Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan or agreement of Sellers or (ii) will assume
sponsorship of, nor will they adopt as a participating company in, any Benefit
Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or agreement of Sellers or any part
thereof. Following the Closing, Sellers agree to remove each of the
Transferred Companies as a participating employer in any benefit plan or
agreement of Sellers. 

(f)No Amendments or Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Section
5.9 will (i) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing
Employee or any beneficiary or dependents thereof with respect to the
compensation, terms, and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by any of Buyers or their Affiliates or
under any Buyer Benefit Plans or otherwise, or (ii) be construed as in any way
modifying or amending the provisions of any Benefit Plan.



5.10. Worker Notification Laws.

(a)Buyers will be exclusively responsible for providing any notices or
payments due to any Continuing Employee, and any notices, payments, fines, or
assessments due to any Governmental Authority, pursuant to any legal
requirement, including Worker Notification Law, arising out of the employment,
discharge, or layoff of any Continuing Employees from and after the Closing.
Sellers will be exclusively responsible for providing any notices or payments
due to any employee of the Transferred Companies or any Solicited DQ Valuation
Business Employee, and any notices, payments, fines, or assessments due to any
Governmental Authority, pursuant to any legal requirement, including Worker
Notification Law, arising out of the employment, discharge, or layoff of any
employees of the Transferred Companies or Solicited DQ Valuation Business
Employees prior to the Closing.

(b)On or before the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law, Sellers will
provide to Buyers the number of employees, if any, located at each site owned
or leased by any of Sellers or their Affiliates prior to the Closing where
Continuing Employees are anticipated to be located after the Closing Date, who
have experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff (as defined
under Worker Notification Law) within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing
Date, along with the date of the employment loss or layoff.

(c)280G Matters. Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1 (Termination
Events), Sellers will take, following Buyers\' provision of all information
reasonably required from Buyers therefor, all actions necessary to conduct a
shareholder vote in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of
the Code and Treasury Regulations section 1.280G-1, QandA 7 with respect to any
excess parachute payments that may be made or provided to any Solicited DQ
Valuation Business Employee or employee of the Transferred Companies who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section
280G of the Code), if such payments reasonably would be expected to result in
the imposition of an excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code on
account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Shareholder
Approval"). Prior to the initiation of the shareholder vote described above,
Sellers will obtain, following Buyers\' provision of all information
reasonably required from Buyers therefor, a waiver of the right to receive
payments that could constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder from each Solicited DQ
Valuation Business Employee or employee of the Transferred Companies who is a
"disqualified individual" to the extent that such payments reasonably would be
expected to result in the imposition of an excise tax imposed under Section
4999 of the Code on account of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Sellers will deliver a copy of each such waiver to Buyers on or
before the Closing. Sellers will permit Buyers reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any proposed shareholder disclosure or waivers of
benefits prior to sending such documents to shareholders or employees and will
promptly notify Buyers upon completion of such vote.



5.11. Regulatory Matters.

(a)The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, will prepare and file
(i) required or necessary notification and report forms under the HSR Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with the U.S. Federal Trade 

Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice (in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement) and (ii) notifications,
filings, registrations and other materials required or necessary under any
other applicable Antitrust Laws, and will respond as promptly as practicable
to all requests or inquiries received from any Governmental Authority for
additional documentation or information. The parties hereto will also
cooperate with each other and will make such other filings as are necessary,
if any, in other jurisdictions in order to comply with all applicable Law and
will promptly provide any supplemental information or documentation requested
by any Governmental Authority relating thereto. Sellers and Buyers will bear
their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such filings;
provided, that Buyers will pay all filing fees in connection therewith.

(b)Each party hereto, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, will promptly
notify the other parties in writing of any material communication it or any of
its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement, and permit the other parties
to review in advance, to the extent permitted by Law, any proposed material
communication by such party to any Governmental Authority. Each party hereto
will agree to participate in any material meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigations, or other inquiries unless
the party consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law, the parties hereto will
coordinate and cooperate fully and promptly with one another in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other parties may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including those under the HSR
Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Law, the parties hereto will provide one another with
copies of all material correspondence, filings, or communications between them
or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c)Buyers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required
approval from any Governmental Authority and to prevent the initiation of any
lawsuit by any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws or the entry of
any decree, judgment, injunction, or order that would otherwise make the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unlawful.

(d)From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and under any other applicable
Antitrust Laws, Buyers and their Affiliates will not take any action that
could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or
the expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR Act and such
other applicable Antitrust Laws.



5.12. Closing Efforts.



Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (and not in limitation
of Section 5.11 (Regulatory Matters)), each of Sellers and Buyers will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or
advisable to cause the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement to be satisfied, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of Sellers and Buyers agrees to execute and deliver such
other documents, certificates, agreements, and other writings, and to take
such other actions, as may be necessary, proper, or advisable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5.12, none of
Sellers, Buyers, or any of their respective Affiliates will be obligated to
make any payments, or otherwise pay any consideration to, any third party to
obtain any applicable consent, waiver, or approval. 



5.13. Public Announcements.



Prior to the Closing, neither Sellers nor Buyers, without the consent of the
other (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned), will issue or make any report, statement, or release to the
public (including employees, customers, and suppliers of the parties) with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except for any SEC filings, any early warning reporting and news releases
required under applicable Canadian Securities Laws, or any other filings
required by applicable Law, Governmental Authority, or listing agreement with
any national securities exchange; provided, that the party required to make
any such filing must afford the other party, for a reasonable period prior to
the making of such filing, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
the intended form and substance of such filing.

5.14. Tax Matters.

(a)Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price will be allocated among the
DIIG Equity Interests (and, specifically, among the Equity Interests of DIIG
I, New DIIG III, and Symbility), the DQ Valuation Assets, and the Luxco IP
Assets in the manner set forth in Exhibit I, with (i) the amounts of the
allocations for the DIIG Equity Interests (other than with respect to the
Equity Interests of Symbility), the DQ Valuation Assets, and the Luxco IP
Assets to be determined, prior the Closing, in good faith by Buyers after
consulting with Sellers and considering in good faith any changes reasonably
requested by Sellers and (ii) the amount of the allocation for the Equity
Interests of Symbility to be as set forth on Schedule 5.14(a) (the
"Allocation"). For purposes of determining the Allocation, the amount of any
Closing Net Indebtedness that results in a Purchase Price Reduction under
Section 2.10(e) (Purchase Price Adjustment) will reduce the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the DIIG Equity Interests (other than the Equity
Interests of Symbility). For the avoidance of doubt, the Allocation (including
any revision thereof) will be made in a manner consistent with the principles
of section 1060 of the Code and will reflect an allocation of the
consideration paid under this Agreement (as determined for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) among the various properties and assets acquired and the
licenses and other rights granted (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes). In the event that there is any adjustment to the consideration paid
under this Agreement (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), the
parties will cooperate in good faith to reach an agreement to revise the
Allocation to reflect any such adjustment. Except as may be required by
applicable Tax Law or by a "determination" (within the meaning of section
1313(a) of the Code or any similar foreign, state, or local Tax provision),
neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates, nor Buyers or any of their
Affiliates, will file any Tax Return or take any position with any Taxing
Authority that is inconsistent with the Allocation. If the Allocation is
disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute
will promptly notify the other parties hereto. Sellers, Buyers, and their
respective Affiliates will cooperate in good faith in responding to any such
challenge to preserve the effectiveness of the Allocation.

(b)Withholding. Buyers will make no withholding of any Tax on the Purchase
Price, or on any adjustment to the Purchase Price in connection with the sale
of the DIIG Equity Interests, the DQ Valuation Assets, or the Luxco IP Assets,
as applicable. If either Buyers or Sellers become aware of any potential
obligation under applicable Tax Law (other than the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder) to make any withholding of Tax on the
Purchase Price or on any adjustment to the Purchase Price, whichever of Buyers
or Sellers becomes so aware will promptly notify the other parties hereto in
writing prior to making any such withholding, and Buyers and Sellers will, in
good faith, (i) promptly resolve disputes (if any) regarding whether and the
extent to which withholding of any such Tax may be required and (ii) cooperate
with each other in order to minimize any such potential withholding of Tax (or
obtain any applicable Tax refunds or credits). Subject to the first two
sentences of this Section 5.14(b), Buyers will be entitled to make any
withholding of Tax, to the extent required by applicable Tax Law, on the
Purchase Price 

and on any adjustment to the Purchase Price, and any amounts so withheld will
be paid over to or deposited with the relevant Taxing Authority, and such
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to Sellers.

(c)Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes, and all expenses of preparing and
filing Tax Returns with respect thereto, will be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Buyers and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers.

(d)Closing Date Ordinary Course of Business. Buyers will not cause or permit
any of the Transferred Companies to take any actions out of the Ordinary
Course of Business on the Closing Date after the Closing that would result in
any income or gain being attributed or recognized on any Tax Return of any of
the Transferred Companies for any Tax period ending on or prior the Closing
Date. Buyers will indemnify each of Sellers and their Affiliates for any
Liability for Taxes attributable to or relating to any such actions that are
outside of the Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date.

(e)Tax Returns.

(i)Sellers will prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Transferred Companies, the DQ Valuation Assets or the Luxco Assets for Taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including any income Tax
Returns ending on the Closing Date as a result of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement). Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as required by applicable Tax Law.
Buyers will cooperate and cause its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies) to cooperate (including by providing relevant books
and records) with Sellers in connection with the preparation of such Tax
Returns. Copies of such Tax Returns will be provided to Buyers at least twenty
(20) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return (including
extensions of time) and Sellers will consider in good faith any comments
reasonably requested by Buyers on such Tax Returns prior to filing, but
Sellers will not be required to incorporate any such comments. Such Tax
Returns will be filed in the manner determined by Sellers. Buyers and their
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) will not,
and Buyers will not permit any of the foregoing to, file, amend, refile or
modify any Tax Return described in this Section 5.14(e)(i) or any Tax Return
of any Transferred Companies, the DQ Valuation Assets or the Luxco Assets
relating to any Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date without
the consent of Stock Seller (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned).

(ii)Buyers will be responsible for causing the preparation and filing of all
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Transferred Companies or with respect
to the operations of the DQ Valuation Business or Luxco IP Assets related to a
Straddle Period or any Taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. Such
Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with the Allocation and
with the past practice of the Transferred Companies and Sellers, and, except
as provided in Section 5.14(e)(iii), no position will be taken, elections
made, or method adopted without the Stock Seller\'s written consent (which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made, or methods used in
preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior Taxable periods. Buyers will
cause to be delivered a copy of each such Tax Return related to a Straddle
Period to Stock Seller together with a statement setting forth the Pre-Closing
Date Share for Sellers\' review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including extensions), and
Buyers will incorporate any comments reasonably requested by Stock Seller, to
the extent such comment affects the portion of the Straddle Period on or
before the Closing Date or the determination of the Pre-Closing Date Share, on
such Tax Return prior to filing. Buyers and their Affiliates (including after
the Closing, the Transferred Companies) will not, and Buyers will not permit
any of the foregoing to file, amend, refile, or modify 

any Tax Return related to a Straddle Period, without the consent of the Stock
Seller (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned).

(iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.14, Buyers may
submit or cause to be submitted, applications or other requests for
participation in voluntary disclosure programs relating to sales and use taxes
of the Transferred Companies (the "Applications") in such jurisdictions and
for such Taxable periods that Buyers determine, in their prudent and
commercially reasonable discretion, are necessary (including those
jurisdictions and for the Taxable years or other periods set forth on Schedule
5.14(e)(iii)) (the "Local Taxes", and such Applications and Tax Returns, the
"Local Tax Filings"). Stock Seller will, and will cause its necessary
Subsidiaries to, provide Buyers with all reasonable cooperation requested by
Buyers in connection with the preparation and filing of such Local Tax
Filings. The Local Taxes (if any) determined to be payable pursuant to this
Section 5.14(e)(iii) will be borne by Sellers and payable in accordance with
Section 8.2(a)(iv), but only to the extent that such Taxes are Pre-Closing
Taxes. Buyers will submit the Local Tax Filings to Stock Seller for review not
less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the filing thereof, and will
consider and discuss in good faith any comments provided by Stock Seller with
respect thereto prior to filing; provided that, in no event, is Stock
Seller\'s consent required in connection with Buyers\' filing of any such
Local Tax Filing in accordance with this Section 5.14(e)(iii).

(f)Tax Refunds. Any refund of Pre-Closing Taxes (or any election to apply the
right to such a refund as a payment of, or a credit against, future Taxes)
that in each case exceeds the amount of such refund of Taxes taken into
account in the computation of the Final Closing Working Capital (a "Pre-
Closing Tax Refund"), will be credited to Sellers. Buyers will promptly pay,
or cause to be paid, the amount of any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund, including
the amount of interest actually received thereon and reduced by the amount of
any Taxes required to be paid by the Transferred Companies or any of their
Affiliates with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Refund or interest, to Sellers
upon receipt (or use) of such Pre-Closing Tax Refund by the Transferred
Companies or any of their Affiliates (it being understood that in the case of
an election to use any such refund as a payment of, or a credit against,
future Taxes, such refund will be considered to be used at the time such
election is made).

(g)Payment of Taxes. Sellers will pay (or cause to be paid) to Buyers (or, at
Buyers\' direction, to an Affiliate of Buyers) the amount of any Pre-Closing
Taxes shown as due on a Tax Return prepared pursuant to Section 5.14(e)(i) for
a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date and the amount of the Pre-
Closing Date Share of any Taxes shown as due on a Tax Return prepared pursuant
to Section 5.14(e)(ii) with respect to a Straddle Period no later than the
later of (i) five (5) Business Days before the due date for the payment of
such Taxes or (ii) five (5) Business Days after the resolution of any dispute
with respect to such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid
by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section 5.14(g) prior to the computation
and resolution of the Closing Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.9
will be properly reflected in such computation. In the event that an
adjustment by a Taxing Authority gives rise to an increase in Pre-Closing
Taxes and, as a result of such adjustment, other Taxes of the Transferred
Companies are or will be decreased, Buyers will promptly pay the amount of
such decrease to the Stock Seller.

(h)Tax Proceedings. Buyers and their Affiliates will promptly (and in any
event, within ten (10) days) notify the Stock Seller in writing upon receipt
by any of the foregoing of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits,
examinations, or similar events with respect to Tax Returns or Taxes of any
the Transferred Companies for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date or with respect to Taxes which could be required to be paid by Sellers
under this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar
event, a "Tax Matter"). Sellers will be entitled to control the defense of any
such Tax Matter that relates to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Matter") before 

any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, for any Pre-Closing Tax Matter the resolution of which by any
Governmental Authority would reasonably be expected to adversely affect either
Buyers or any of the Transferred Companies, Buyers will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter. With respect to
any Tax Matter other than a Pre-Closing Tax Matter, Buyers and Sellers will be
entitled to jointly control the defense.

(i)If Sellers assume and control the defense of any Pre-Closing Tax Matter,
Buyers will cooperate with Sellers in pursuing such Pre-Closing Tax Matter and
Sellers will keep Buyers reasonably informed of all material developments and
events relating to such Pre-Closing Tax Matter, including, without limitation,
promptly forwarding to Buyers all material correspondence related to such Pre-
Closing Tax Matter; provided that if a proposed settlement or compromise of
such Pre-Closing Tax Matter would adversely affect either any of Buyers or any
of the Transferred Companies, then Sellers will not enter into such settlement
or compromise of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter without the prior written consent
of Buyers (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned).

(ii)If Sellers do not elect to control or participate in the defense of any
Tax Matter, Buyers will control the defense of such Tax Matter but will keep
the Stock Seller informed of the progress of such Tax Matter including,
without limitation, promptly forwarding to the Stock Seller all correspondence
related to such Tax Matter. None of Buyers or any of their Affiliates may
enter into any settlement or compromise of any Tax Matter, without the prior
written consent of the Stock Seller (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

(iii)In the case of any Tax Matter jointly controlled by the parties, each
party will (A) promptly provide the other party with a copy of all documents
relating to such Tax Matter, (B) jointly prepare any written submissions in
connection with such audit, examination or Tax Proceeding, (C) jointly attend
any conference with any Governmental Authority regarding such audit,
examination or Tax Proceeding, and (D) not settle or compromise any such
audit, examination or Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
other party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned).

(iv)If there will be any conflicts or disparities between the provisions of
this Section 5.14(h) and other provisions in this Agreement, the provisions of
this Section 5.14(h) will control with respect to Tax Matters.

It is understood that, for purposes of this Section 5.14, the incurrence of
additional Taxes, other than de minimus Taxes, for which a party is
responsible as a matter of Law or pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a
reasonable basis for such party to withhold consent.



5.15. Schedules.

(a)Updating Schedules. Sellers must, from time to time, prior to the Closing
Date, provide to Buyer a supplement or amendment to the Schedules in writing
(a "Schedules Notice") to disclose any information, with respect to any
circumstance or event, that otherwise would render any representation or
warranty of Sellers contained in ARTICLE III (Representations and Warranties
of Sellers), if made on the Closing Date (or, in the case of representations
and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, as of that
date), untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; provided, that any such
Schedules Notice will not be taken into account in determining the existence
of a breach of any representation or warranty for purposes of ARTICLE VIII
(Indemnification). If Sellers deliver a Schedules Notice (which may contain 

additional Schedules that are not in existence as of the date of this
Agreement relating to any of the provisions contained in ARTICLE III
(Representations and Warranties of Sellers)) pursuant to this Section 5.15 and
disclose information that makes it impossible for Sellers to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) (Conditions Precedent to Buyers\'
Obligation to Close), then Buyers will have the right to terminate this
Agreement by providing written notice of such termination to Sellers within
seven (7) Business Days of Buyers\' receipt of the final Schedules Notice;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a Schedules Notice will
not constitute an action set forth in subsection (b)(vii) of the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect", and any items and/or actions set forth in a
Schedules Notice may be taken into account when assessing whether there has
been a Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this sentence. In assessing the
existence of a breach of any representation or warranty for purposes of
ARTICLE VIII (Indemnification), the accuracy of such representation or
warranty will be assessed without reference to any Schedules Notice.

(b)Construction of Schedules. The headings, if any, of the individual sections
of the Schedules are inserted for convenience only, and will not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or of the Agreement. The Schedules are arranged in
sections corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Schedules as
an exception to any particular representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to
all other representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements to the extent
that the relevance of such item to such other representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements is reasonably apparent upon its face
(notwithstanding the presence or absence of a section number of the Schedules
that corresponds to the section number of such other representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements or a cross-reference thereto). The mere
inclusion of an item on the Schedules will not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, and exclusively by virtue of the inclusion
of such item on the Schedules, that (i) such item is required to be listed on
the Schedules, (ii) such item, or any non-disclosed item or information of
comparable or greater significance, represents a material exception or fact,
event, or circumstance, (iii) such item is material, or has had, or is
expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) such item actually
constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of, any applicable Law, permit,
or contract, or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable.



5.16. Post-Closing Matters.

(a)To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Sellers authorize and empower
Buyers on and after the Closing Date to receive and open all mail and other
communications received by Buyers to the extent relating to the Business (as
determined in good faith by Buyers) and to deal with the contents of such
communications in good faith and in a proper manner. Sellers will promptly
deliver to Buyers any mail or other communication received by Sellers after
the Closing Date if pertaining to the Business. Sellers agree that Buyers have
the right and authority to endorse any check or other evidence of indebtedness
received by Buyers in respect of any account receivable transferred to Buyers
pursuant to this Agreement and Sellers will furnish Buyers such evidence of
this authority as Buyers may reasonably request.

(b)Subject to the Transition Services Agreement, Sellers will, or will cause
their Subsidiaries to, promptly, but in no case later than five (5) Business
Days from the date of identification of the amount of funds required to be
paid or delivered to Buyers, pay or deliver to Buyers any monies or checks
transferred to Buyers pursuant to this Agreement that are received by Sellers
subsequent to the Closing Date.

(c)In the event that, following the Closing, Buyers or Sellers discover that
(i) a Retained Liability was transferred to Buyers prior to or at the Closing,
then Sellers will assume such Retained Liability from Buyers and will execute
such further documents and instruments reasonably requested and necessary to
give effect to and evidence such assumption or (ii) a DQ Valuation Business
Asset or IP Asset was not transferred to Buyers pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement at the Closing, then Sellers will assign, transfer, 

and convey such DQ Valuation Business Asset or IP Asset to Buyers, and will
execute such further documents and instruments reasonably requested and
necessary to give effect to and evidence such assignment, transfer and
conveyance.

(d)In the event that, following the Closing, Buyers or Sellers discover that
(i) a Transferred Liability was not transferred to Buyers prior to or at the
Closing, then Buyers will assume such Transferred Liability from Sellers and
will execute such further documents and instruments reasonably requested
necessary to give effect to and evidence such assumption or (ii) a Retained
Asset was transferred to Buyers, then Buyers will assign, transfer, and convey
such Retained Asset to Sellers, and will execute such further documents and
instruments reasonably requested and necessary to give effect to and evidence
such assignment, transfer and conveyance.



5.17. Further Licenses.



It is the intention of the Parties to ensure that the DQ Valuation Business
and the Excluded Businesses each retain the ability to operate in their
customary manner prior to the Closing, subject to and on the terms set forth
in the Buyer Transition Services Agreement, Seller Transition Services
Agreement, Master Services and License Agreement, and Patent License Agreement
(the "Transition Agreements"). Therefore, to the extent there exists, as of
immediately following the Closing, any Intellectual Property Right (other than
Trademarks) (a) owned by any of Sellers or their Subsidiaries that was used in
the DQ Valuation Business as of the Closing that is not available for use in
the DQ Valuation Business, including pursuant to the Transition Agreements, or
(b) any Business Intellectual Property Rights (other than Trademarks) owned by
any of Buyers or their Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement that was used in
the Excluded Businesses as of the Closing that is not available for use in the
Excluded Businesses, including pursuant to the Transition Agreements, each
Party hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to identify
such Intellectual Property Rights and (ii) to negotiate in good faith the
addition of such services to the applicable Transition Agreements.

5.18. Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.



From the Closing through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyers will not, and Buyer Guarantor will not permit any of Buyers or the
Transferred Companies to, amend, repeal, or otherwise modify any provision in
any of the Transferred Companies\' Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation, indemnification, or advancement of expenses of any current or
former officers or directors with respect to acts or omissions prior to the
Closing, unless required to do so by applicable Law, it being the intent of
the parties hereto that such Persons will continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expenses to the full extent
of applicable Law and as otherwise provided for in the provisions of such
Organizational Documents. In addition, Buyers, at their sole expense, will,
and Buyer Guarantor will cause Buyers and the Transferred Companies to,
maintain in effect, from the Closing through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering
those Persons who either (a) are covered by the Transferred Companies\'
liability insurance policies as of date of this Agreement and (b) are hired
after the date of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3 (Negative
Covenants) and are covered by the Transferred Companies\' liability insurance
policies as of immediately prior to the Closing, with coverage limits not
lower in any respect than, and otherwise on terms no less favorable to the
insured parties than, the Transferred Companies\' insurance coverage as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that in no event will Buyers
or Buyer Guarantor be required to expend on such insurance an amount in excess
of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium of such insurance
coverage paid by or on behalf of the Transferred Companies as of the date of
this Agreement. If any of Buyers or any of the Transferred Companies, or any
of their respective successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into 

any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys substantially all of
its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provision
will be made, and Buyer Guarantor will cause proper provision to be made, so
that the successors and assigns of such Buyer or such Transferred Company, as
the case may be, will readily assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.18.

5.19. Pre-Closing Reorganization.



Sellers will effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization prior to the Closing, and
provide Buyers with written evidence that the Pre-Closing Reorganization has
been completed. In completing the Pre-Closing Reorganization, Sellers will not
materially modify or materially deviate from the steps set forth on Schedule
PCR without the prior written consent of Buyers (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).



5.20. Repayment of Debt.

(a)Payoff Letters. By no later than one (1) day prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers will (a) arrange for the release of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) on the properties and assets of the Transferred Companies, the DQ
Valuation Assets, and the Luxco IP Assets at or prior to the Closing and (b)
deliver to Buyers a copy of a payoff letter, in commercially reasonable form
and substance, with respect to each Credit Facility (collectively, the "Payoff
Letters"), stating that, upon payment and receipt of the amounts provided in
such Payoff Letter (in respect of each Payoff Letter, the "Payoff Amount"),
(i) Sellers and/or the Transferred Companies, as applicable, will have paid in
full all amounts outstanding under such Credit Facility, (ii) the agreements
evidencing such Credit Facility will be of no further force and effect (other
than provisions that, by their terms, survive termination), and (iii) in the
case of Credit Facility I, the lenders under such Credit Facility agree to
execute and file all documents necessary to release all Liens, if any, held by
them in the Transferred Companies, the DQ Valuation Assets, and the Luxco IP
Assets, which Lien releases will be delivered at and filed concurrent with the
Closing. At or prior to the Closing, Buyers will, and Sellers will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyers to, execute and
deliver such documents and complete such tasks as are necessary to provide for
the replacement of any outstanding letters of credit issued by or on behalf of
the Transferred Companies with new, replacement letters of credit.

(b)Payment of Payoff Amounts. Sellers and Buyers each agree that the Payoff
Amounts will be paid at the Closing, out of the Purchase Price, as provided
for in the Payoff Letters.



5.21. Financing Efforts; Cooperation.

(a)Efforts to Obtain Financing. The obligations of Buyers under this Agreement
are not contingent on the availability of financing. Buyers will, if necessary
to fulfill their obligations under this Agreement, use their reasonable best
efforts to arrange financing for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on customary terms and conditions, including (i) negotiating and
entering into definitive agreements for such financing as soon as reasonably
practicable, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to Buyers in such definitive agreements, (iii) consummating
Buyers\' financing at or prior to the Closing if all conditions to closing
contained in ARTICLE VII are satisfied, waived, or would be satisfied if the
Closing had occurred, and (iv) enforcing its rights under such definitive
documents or any other contractual commitment to provide such financing
obtained by Buyers. Buyers will give prompt notice to Sellers if for any
reason the Buyers believe in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the financing contemplated to be arranged by it. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within 

five (5) Business Days after Sellers deliver a written request, Buyers will
provide any information reasonably requested by Sellers relating to any
financing being arranged by Buyers.

(b)Assistance with Financing. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 7.1 (Termination Events), Sellers will, will cause
each of their Subsidiaries to, and will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of their and their Subsidiaries\' agents and
representatives to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Buyers with all reasonable cooperation requested by Buyers that is
customary in connection with the arrangement of debt financing reasonably
proposed by Buyers, including (i) making senior management of the Transferred
Companies reasonably available for a reasonable number of customary meetings
or conference calls with lenders or rating agencies at times and locations as
are mutually agreed, (ii) furnishing, to the extent reasonably available, (A)
all financial statements and financial and other material information that are

security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other customary
certificates or documents required to be delivered in connection with the
financing on such date as may be reasonably requested by Buyers and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral required in connection with
the financing; provided, that (x) such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Sellers or their
Subsidiaries, (y) all costs incurred by or on behalf of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation will be at Buyers\' sole cost
and expense, and (z) none of Sellers, their Subsidiaries, or Sellers\' or
their Subsidiaries\' respective agents or representatives will be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee, or incur any Liability, in connection
with Buyers\' financing. Buyers will (i) promptly, upon request by Sellers,
reimburse Sellers, their Subsidiaries, and their respective agents and
representatives for all out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees) incurred by Sellers, their Subsidiaries, and their respective agents and
representatives in connection with any cooperation contemplated by this
Section 5.21(b) and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless each of Sellers, their
Subsidiaries, and Sellers\' and their Subsidiaries\' respective agents and

the avoidance of doubt, with respect to all rights and Liabilities of the

Luxco IP Assets arising thereunder, except for any continuing rights and
Liabilities expressly provided for in this Agreement.

customers set forth on Schedule 5.26 (the "Straddle Contracts"); provided,
that none of Sellers, Buyers, or their respective representatives,
Subsidiaries, or Subsidiaries\' representatives will be required to grant any

Affiliates), or incur any additional costs in order to obtain novation of any
of the Straddle Contracts (except, in each case, for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses to the extent incurred in performing the actions and procedures set

obtained prior to the Closing, from and after the Closing, each of Sellers and
Buyers will, and will cause their respective representatives and Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to enter
into one or more additional Services Schedules under Section 1.5 of the Seller

warranties or covenants of Sellers under this Agreement for purposes of
Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) (Conditions Precedent to Buyers\' Obligations to
Close).

contrary to applicable Law binding on Sellers or their Affiliates or
initiating litigation. The parties hereto agree that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement.





ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION



8.1. Survival.



If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, each of
(i) the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in ARTICLE III
(Representations and Warranties of Sellers) and the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and (ii) the representations and warranties of
Buyers contained in ARTICLE IV (Representations and Warranties of Buyers) and
the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.7(f) will survive the Closing
for the Indemnity Period, after which such representations and warranties will
terminate, subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.1; provided, that
the representations of Sellers contained in each of Sections 3.11 (Employee
Benefit Plans) and 3.16 (Taxes) will survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations plus sixty (60) days, after which such
representations and warranties will terminate, subject to the final sentence
of this Section 8.1, and; provided, further, that the representations of
Sellers contained in each of the Specified Sections, and the representations
of Buyers contained in Sections 4.1 (Organization), 4.2 (Authorization;
Enforceability), and 4.4 (Brokers) will survive in perpetuity. If the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be
performed prior to the Closing will survive the Closing for the Indemnity
Period, and the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that by
their nature are required to be performed after the Closing will survive the
Closing in 

accordance with their respective terms, in each case, subject to the final
sentence of this Section 8.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section
8.1, to the extent that an Indemnity Notice or a notice regarding a Tax Matter
is given in accordance with the terms of Section 8.4 or Section 5.14(h),
respectively, within the applicable survival period provided above, the claims
specifically set forth in the Indemnity Notice or the notice regarding a Tax
Matter, as the case may be, will survive until such time as they are finally
resolved.



8.2. Agreement to Indemnify.

(a)Indemnification by Sellers. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
ARTICLE VIII and Section 5.14 (Tax Matters), from and after the Closing,
Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each

against any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising from, or in connection
with, any of the following:

(i)any breach of any of the representations and warranties of Sellers
contained in ARTICLE III (Representations and Warranties of Sellers) or the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.6(f);

(ii)any breach of any of the covenants and agreements by Sellers contained in
this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the

to the extent that any such Indebtedness that is included in the amount of
Final Closing Net Indebtedness;

(iv)any and all Pre-Closing Taxes and Local Taxes payable in accordance with
Section 5.14(e)(iii); provided, that the indemnity contained in this Section
8.2(a)(iv) will be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
against Sellers for any Losses in respect of Taxes relating to any Person or
period;

(v)any Retained Liabilities (not including agreements entered into before, at,
or after the Closing between any of Buyers or their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any of Sellers or their Affiliates, on the other hand, but subject
to the rights and obligations under this Agreement); and

(vi)the matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(vi).

(b)Indemnification by Buyers. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
ARTICLE VIII and Section 5.14 (Tax Matters), from and after the Closing,
Buyers will, and Buyer Guarantor will cause Buyers to, indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless each of the Seller Indemnified Parties against all Losses
suffered by or asserted against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties arising
from, or in connection with, any of the following:

(i)any breach of the representations and warranties of Buyers contained in
ARTICLE IV (Representations and Warranties of Buyers) or the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 2.7(f);

(ii)any breach of any of the covenants and agreements by Buyers contained in
this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the
Closing;

(iii)the operation of the Business (not including (A) agreements entered into
before, at, or after the Closing between any of Sellers or their Affiliates,
on the one hand, and any of Buyers 

or their Affiliates, on the other hand, but subject to the rights and
obligations under this Agreement, or (B) Losses for which Buyers are entitled
to indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE VIII (Indemnification)) and, without
duplication, from the Transferred Liabilities; and

(iv)(A) the guarantee by Stock Seller, at any time after the Closing Date
subject to such guarantee\'s terms, solely to the extent relating to any
Transferred Companies obligations and DQ Valuation Business obligations under
the Contractual Obligations set forth on Schedule 8.2(b)(iv), and (B) any
guarantees by Stock Seller, at any time after the Closing Date subject to such
guarantees\' respective terms, solely to the extent relating to any
Transferred Companies obligations and DQ Valuation Business obligations under
the Contractual Obligations set forth on Schedule 5.5(c) for which the parties
do not receive novations prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 5.5(c);
provided, that no Seller Indemnified Party will be entitled to any
indemnification with respect to any such guarantees for Losses resulting from
any acts of fraud, gross negligence, or intentional misconduct by Stock Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Companies prior to the
Closing, but excluding the Transferred Companies from and after the Closing).



8.3. Procedures for Non-Third-Party Claims

(a)Delivery of Indemnity Notice. With respect to indemnification sought
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller
Indemnified Party (as applicable, the "Indemnified Party") against another
party (the "Indemnifying Party") that does not involve a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly upon
the Indemnified Party\'s discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying
Party may be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder, a written notice of
such claim, describing in reasonable detail (i) the nature of such claim, (ii)
the amount, or the Indemnified Party\'s best estimate of the amount, of the
Losses attributable to such claim, and (iii) the basis of the Indemnified
Party\'s request for indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII (an "Indemnity
Notice"); provided, that the failure of an Indemnified Party to promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnified Party for
liability for the applicable claim, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party was actually prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party, and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing
reasonable access to and copies of information, records, and documents
relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation,
defense, and resolution of such matters, and providing legal and business
assistance with respect to such matters.

(b)Delivery of Dispute Notice. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days from the Indemnifying
Party\'s receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes
all or a portion of the Losses set forth in such Indemnity Notice (a "Dispute
Notice"), some or all of the claims for Losses, as applicable, under such
Indemnity Notice will be resolved in accordance with Section 9.7
(Jurisdiction), and any such amount of Losses finally determined to be owed to
the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party will be referred to as a
"Resolved Amount". If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver a Dispute
Notice, or delivers a Dispute Notice that accepts a portion of the Losses set
forth in an Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
agreed with all or a portion of such Losses, as applicable, specified in such
Indemnity Notice, and any such amount of Losses will be referred to as an
"Unobjected Amount".



8.4. Procedures For Third-Party Claims.

(a)Delivery of Indemnity Notice. With respect to indemnification sought
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII by an Indemnified Party against an Indemnifying
Party that involves a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will deliver to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly upon the Indemnified Party\'s receipt of
written notice of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, an Indemnity Notice
and copies of all papers served with respect to such Third-Party Claim (if
any); provided, that the failure of an Indemnified Party to promptly notify
the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnified Party for liability
for the applicable claim, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was
actually prejudiced by such delay.

(b)Control by Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will have fifteen
(15) Business Days from the date on which the Indemnifying Party received the
Indemnity Notice to notify the Indemnified Party in writing that the
Indemnifying Party (i) will indemnify the Indemnified Party for all Losses
that are properly indemnifiable under this Agreement arising out of the Third-
Party Claim and (ii) desires to assume the defense or prosecution of the
Third-Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its
choice that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided,
that the Indemnified Party rather than the Indemnifying Party will control any
Third-Party Claim involving criminal allegations, a Governmental Authority
other than with respect to Tax Proceedings, and claims for equitable relief
other than equitable relief that is immaterial and merely incidental to a
primary claim for monetary damages, in each of which cases the Indemnifying
Party will be entitled to participate in defense of the Third-Party Claim.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof, unless, in the written opinion of counsel for the
Indemnified Party, the Third-Party Claim involves potential conflicts of
interest or substantially different defenses for the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, in which case the Indemnifying Party will be liable to the
Indemnified Party for the fees and expenses of one counsel and, if necessary,
local counsel. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Party will have the right to participate in defense thereof, and to employ
counsel, at its own expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party will be liable for the fees and expenses of one counsel
and, if necessary, local counsel, employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
and as otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding sentences. If
the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any Liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). The Indemnifying Party may
pay, settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party, so long as such settlement (i) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect
of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnified Party to any
criminal liability or injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (iii)
does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to
act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

(c)Control by Indemnified Party. If (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to notify
the Indemnified Party, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
Indemnifying Party\'s receipt of the Indemnity Notice, that the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with
Section 8.4(b) or (ii) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, a court of
competent jurisdiction rules that the Indemnifying Party has failed to
diligently defend a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have
the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
such Third-Party Claim by all 

appropriate Proceedings (subject to the limitations set forth in Section
8.4(b)), upon delivery of written notice to such effect to the Indemnifying
Party. With respect to any Third-Party Claim described the immediately
preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate
in, but not control, the defense thereof, and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnified Party.

(d)Cooperation. The Indemnified Party will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in all aspects of
any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise,
settlement, and discharge of any claim in respect of which the Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to control, including, but not limited to,
providing the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to books, records, and
employees of the Indemnified Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e)Tax Matters. Any and all claims for indemnification with respect to Tax
Matters will be governed by Section 5.14(h) and not by this Section 8.4.



8.5. Limitations.

(a)Deductible; Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i) (Agreement to Indemnify), (i)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses of such
Indemnified Parties equals or exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Deductible"), in which
case the Indemnified Parties may make claims for indemnification for all
Losses in excess of the Deductible or (ii) in excess of, in the aggregate,
$30,000,000 (the "Cap"); provided, that the Deductible and Cap will not apply
with respect to (A) any claims involving fraud by Sellers (with respect to
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)) or Buyers (with
respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i)) or (B)
any claims involving a breach of any of the Specified Sections (with respect
to claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)), or involving a
breach of any of Sections 4.1 (Organization), 4.2 (Authorization;
Enforceability), and 4.4 (Brokers) (with respect to claims for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i)).

(b)Determination of Losses. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Losses arising out of, relating to, or resulting any breach of a
representation or warranty, but not for purposes of determining whether or not
such failure has occurred, such representation and warranty will be considered
without giving effect to any limitation or qualifications as to "materiality,"
"Material Adverse Effect", or any other derivation of the word "material".

(c)Insurance; Tax Benefits. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification
is provided to an Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE VIII will be reduced by
(i) any amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under insurance
policies with respect to such Losses, less the aggregate amount of all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with the recovery of such proceeds (including payment of deductibles and self-
insured retention amounts), and less the present value of all insurance policy
premium increases resulting therefrom and (ii) any Tax benefit actually
recognized on a "with" or "without" basis by any Indemnified Party, any of its
Affiliates, or any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any such
Indemnified Party or Affiliate is a member in connection with the accrual,
incurrence, or payment of such Losses, or any correlative adjustment that
makes allowable to any such Indemnified Party group any deduction,
amortization, exclusion from income, or other allowance. Each Indemnified
Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such insurance
policies and Tax benefits, and in the event an Indemnified Party receives any
recovery, the amount of such recovery will be applied, first, to refund any
payments made by the Indemnifying Party in respect of 

indemnification claims pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII which would not have been
so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment, and second, any
excess to such Indemnified Party.

(d)Mitigation. An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification will use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss that forms the basis of
an indemnification claim under this ARTICLE VIII, including by seeking and
pursuing any available insurance coverage or other claims against third
parties that such Indemnified Parties may have in respect of such Losses;
provided, that no Indemnified Party will be required to take or refrain from
taking any action that is contrary to any applicable Law binding on such
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or that requires the initiation of
litigation.

(e)No Double Recovery. To the extent that an Indemnified Party is otherwise
indemnified or compensated for any claim for which indemnification may be
asserted under this ARTICLE VIII or any other provision in this Agreement
(including pursuant to Section 2.10 (Adjustment to Purchase Price; Payment)),
then the Indemnified Party will not be entitled to any duplicative recovery
for that matter as an indemnification claim pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII.



8.6. Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments.



All payments (if any) made to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE VIII will be treated as
adjustments to the purchase price for Tax purposes, and the Allocation will be
adjusted in accordance with Section 5.14(a) (Tax Matters), and such agreed
treatment will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.



8.7. Application of Escrow Amount; Release of Escrow Amount.

(a)If there is determined to be any Unobjected Amount or Resolved Amount other
than with respect to a Special Indemnity Claim owing to a Buyer Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 8.3(b), or if there is otherwise determined to be
any amount other than with respect to a Special Indemnity Claim owing to a
Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII
at any time at which there is any Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in
the Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account will be
used by such Buyer Indemnified Party as first recourse to satisfy any and all
amounts owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such claim
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII; provided, that the Indemnity Escrow Amount may,
but need not be, used by a Buyer Indemnified Party as first recourse to
satisfy any and all amounts owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(iv), Section 8.2(a)(v) or Section 8.2(a)(vi). If there is
determined to be an Unobjected Amount or Resolved Amount with respect to a
Special Indemnity Claim owing to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
8.3(b), or if there is otherwise determined to be any amount with respect to a
Special Indemnity Claim owing to a Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of
indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII at any time at which there is any
Special Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow Account, the
Special Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account will be used by such
Buyer Indemnified Party as first recourse to satisfy any and all amounts owed
to such Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such Special Indemnity Claim
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII; provided, that, at any such time as the Special
Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow Account is insufficient
to satisfy a Special Indemnity Claim, the Indemnity Escrow Amount may be used
by a Buyer Indemnified Party in whole or in part to satisfy any and all
amounts owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such Special
Indemnity Claim. However, if either the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Special
Indemnity Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Account is insufficient to satisfy
in full any such Unobjected Amount or Resolved Amount owing 

to such Buyer Indemnified Party, such Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled
to recourse directly against Sellers for the balance thereof, subject to the
other limitations of this ARTICLE VIII.

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following the expiration of the Indemnity Period, Stock Seller
and Buyer Guarantor will cause the Escrow Agent to release to Stock Seller, in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, all of the remaining Escrow Amount, if
any, in excess of (i) any Escrow Amount previously released by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(f)(i) (Adjustment to Purchase Price; Payment)
and Section 8.7(a) and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and (ii) any
amount of Escrow Amount calculated pursuant to the following sentence to
satisfy all unresolved, unsatisfied, or disputed claims for Losses specified
in one or more Indemnity Notices or notices regarding Tax Matters given in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.4 or Section 5.14(h), respectively,
before the expiration of the Indemnity Period. If any claims are unresolved,
unsatisfied, or disputed as of the expiration of the Indemnity Period, then an
amount of the Escrow Amount that equals the total maximum amount of Losses
then being claimed by Buyers Indemnified Parties in good faith in all such
unresolved, unsatisfied, or disputed claims will be retained in the Escrow
Account. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following resolution of all such unresolved, unsatisfied, or
disputed claims, Stock Seller and Stock Buyer will cause the Escrow Agent to
release to Stock Seller, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the
remaining Escrow Amount, if any, not required to satisfy such claims.





8.8. Non-Recourse Parties.



Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based
upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, may
only be made against, the entities and Persons that are expressly identified
as parties hereto in their capacities as such, and no former, current, or
future stockholders, equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents, or
Affiliates of any party hereto, or any financing source of Buyers in its
capacity as such, or any former, current, or future direct or indirect
stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee,
general or limited partner, member, manager, agent, or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing (each, a "Non-Recourse Party") will have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract, or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement.
Without limiting the rights of any party hereto against the other parties
hereto, in no event will any party hereto or any of its Affiliates seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from any Non-Recourse Party.



ARTICLE IX.

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1. Specific Performance.



The parties hereto hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate,
extensive, and irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy at law
would exist, and damages would be difficult to determine in the event that any
provision of this Agreement, including Section 5.7 (Post-Closing Access;
Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition), were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms, or were otherwise breached. Therefore, a
party hereto will be entitled to specific performance of the 

terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief to enjoin any breach or
threatened breach hereof, including of Section 5.7 (Post-Closing Access;
Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition), without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and without bond or other
security being required. Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges and
agrees that it may be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty,
that it may be difficult to procure suitable substitute performance, and that
injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not cause an undue hardship
to the parties. Each of the parties hereto hereby further acknowledges that
the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not
diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder
or any other injunctive relief. Each of the parties hereto hereby further
agrees that, in the event of any action by another party hereto for specific
performance or injunctive relief, such party will not assert that a remedy at
law or other remedy would be adequate, or that specific performance or
injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation or threatened breach
or violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages are
adequate or any other grounds. Each of the parties hereto hereby further
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. To the extent any party
hereto brings a Proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce
specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this
Agreement) when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the Termination Date will automatically be extended to the
later of (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of
such Proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Proceeding.



9.2. Certain Remedies.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after the Closing,
no party may seek to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



9.3. Further Assurances.



From time to time after the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyers, upon the request
of the other, will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
such further instruments (including instruments of conveyance, assignment, and
transfer), and will take such further actions, as the other reasonably may
request in order more effectively to sell, assign, convey, transfer, reduce to
possession, and record title to any of the DIIG Equity Interests, the DQ
Valuation Assets, or the Luxco IP Assets, or to otherwise effectuate the
intent and purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, promptly following the Closing, and thereafter in due course as
agreed by the Parties, the Parties will collaborate and use commercially
reasonable efforts, at Buyers\' sole expense, to update the records of all
necessary Governmental Authorities to reflect that (a) the Business
Intellectual Property is correctly recorded following the Closing in the name
of the applicable Seller as of immediately prior to the Closing, and (b) the
Business Intellectual Property is correctly recorded following the Closing in
the name of Buyers or their applicable Affiliate as of immediately following
the Closing.



9.4. Entire Agreement; Amendment.



This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the parties hereto pertaining to the subject
matter hereof, and there are no warranties, 

representations, or other agreements between the parties hereto, or on which
any of them has relied in connection with the subject matter hereof, except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement or in the Ancillary Documents. No
amendment, supplement, modification, waiver, or termination of this Agreement
will be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby.
No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed or will
constitute a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not
similar, nor will such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly
provided.



9.5. Expenses.



Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, each of the parties hereto will pay the filing fees and expenses
incurred by it, including the fees of respective counsel, accountants,
brokers, and other experts incident to the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that Buyers will pay the filing fees described in Section 5.11(a)
(Regulatory Matters), and each of Buyers and Sellers will bear fifty percent
(50%) of any Liability for Transfer Taxes and expenses of preparing and filing
Tax Returns with respect thereto in accordance with Section 5.14(c) (Transfer
Taxes).



9.6. Governing Law.



This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any
other jurisdiction.



9.7. Jurisdiction.



Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each party hereto,
by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the State of
Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware in respect of actions brought against it as a defendant,
for the purpose of any action, claim, cause of action, or suit (in contract,
tort, or otherwise), in any way arising out of, or relating to, this
Agreement, its negotiation, or terms, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) hereby waives irrevocably any rights to any other jurisdiction
to which it may otherwise be entitled by reason of its present or future
domicile or otherwise and to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise,
in any such action, any claim that such party is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that such party\'s property is exempt
or immune from attachment or execution, that any such proceeding brought in
one of the above-named courts is improper, that the venue is improper, or that
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court, and (c) hereby agrees not to commence or prosecute any such action,
claim, cause of action, or suit other than before one of the above-named
courts, nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending
to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of action,
or suit to any court other than one of the above-named courts, whether on the
grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each party hereto hereby consents
to service of process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by the
Laws of Delaware, and further consents to service of process by nationally
recognized overnight courier service guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at such party\'s
address specified pursuant to Section 9.10 (Notices). Notwithstanding the
foregoing in this Section 9.7, a party may commence any action, claim, cause
of action, or suit in a court other than the above-named courts exclusively
for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-
named courts. 



9.8. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.



TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT
(WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT, OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT,
TORT, OR OTHERWISE), IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO, THIS AGREEMENT,
ITS NEGOTIATION OR TERMS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH OF THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
THAT THIS SECTION 9.8 CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE OTHER
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by

with consent, and upon the advice, of said independent counsel. Each of the
parties hereto and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and any and all drafts relating
hereto and thereto will be deemed the work product of the parties, and may not
be construed against any party hereto by reason of its preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of law or legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against the party that
drafted it is of no application, and is hereby expressly waived.

9.15. Waiver of Conflicts.



Recognizing that Ropes and Gray LLP has acted as legal counsel to Sellers and
certain of their Affiliates prior to date of this Agreement, and that Ropes and
Gray LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Sellers and their Affiliates
(which will no longer include the Transferred Companies) after the Closing,
Buyers and Buyer 

Guarantor hereby waive and agree to cause their Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Transferred Companies) to waive, any conflicts that may arise
in connection with Ropes and Gray LLP representing any of Sellers or their
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyers,
Buyer Guarantor, the Transferred Companies, or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between Sellers and their Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Transferred Companies), on the one hand, and Ropes and Gray LLP, on
the other hand, relating exclusively to the negotiation, documentation, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Sale
Engagement Attorney-Client Communications") will be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong exclusively to Sellers and their Affiliates
(excluding, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies). Accordingly, none
of Buyers, Buyer Guarantor, or any of their Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies) will have access to the Sale Engagement Attorney-Client
Communications or to the files of Ropes and Gray LLP relating to the Sale
Engagement Attorney-Client Communications from and after the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a)
Sellers and their Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Companies) will be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Sale
Engagement Attorney-Client Communications, and none of the Transferred
Companies will be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Ropes and
Gray LLP in respect of the Sale Engagement Attorney-Client Communications
constitute property of the client, only Sellers and their Affiliates
(excluding the Transferred Companies) will hold such property rights and (c)
Ropes and Gray LLP will have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Sale
Engagement Attorney-Client Communications or files to the Transferred
Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Ropes and Gray
LLP and the Transferred Companies or otherwise. Nothing in the foregoing will
prevent any Continuing Employee following the Closing from sharing his or her
knowledge of the Sale Engagement Attorney-Client Communications with any of
Buyers or Buyer Guarantor; provided, that Sellers and their Affiliates will
retain the right to assert privilege regarding all such Sale Engagement
Attorney-Client Communications in any Proceeding among any of Sellers and/or
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of Buyers, Buyer Guarantor, and/or
their Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) on the other hand. To
the extent that any of Sellers or their respective Affiliates waives the
attorney-client privilege with regard to a Sale Engagement Attorney-Client
Communication, this provision will not prevent Buyers or Buyer Guarantor from
obtaining access to such information. This Section 9.15 will be irrevocable,
and no term of this Section 9.15 may be amended, waived, or modified, without
the prior written consent of Ropes and Gray LLP.
