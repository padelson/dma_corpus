and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with management&#146;s general or specific authorizations; (b)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (c)&nbsp;access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management&#146;s general or specific authorization; and (d)&nbsp;the recorded accountability
for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. The Company has delivered to Parent complete and accurate
copies of notices received from its independent auditor prior to the date hereof of any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
since December&nbsp;31, 2003 and any other management letter or similar correspondence from any
independent auditor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received since December&nbsp;31, 2002 and

its terms and with ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable thereto, except for such

as required by applicable Law, or (B)&nbsp;accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the

in this Agreement, and no amounts payable under the Company Benefit Plans will fail to be
deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code (assuming no

after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (the &#147;Subsequent Parent SEC Documents&#148;) will

the Parent Benefit Plans above the level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the year ended
