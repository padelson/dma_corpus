2.4 _Post-Closing Purchase Price True -Up_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare, at Purchaser's expense, and deliver to the Member Representative, a
written statement (the " _Final Closing Payment Calculation Statement_ ")
setting forth Purchaser's calculations (the " _Purchaser 's Proposed
Calculations_") of the amounts of (i) the Closing Indebtedness, (ii) the Cash
on Hand, (iii) the Closing Net Working Capital (and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment calculated by reference thereto), (iv) the Company Transaction
Expenses and (v) the Change of Control Cash Payments. The Final Closing
Payment Calculation Statement shall contain a recalculation of the Closing
Payment Amount based on the foregoing amounts of Closing Indebtedness, Cash on
Hand, the Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Company Transaction Expenses and
the Change of Control Cash Payments.

  



  

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the Final Closing
Payment Calculation Statement (the " _Response Period_ "), the Member
Representative shall notify Purchaser in writing of its agreement or
disagreement with the Final Closing Payment Calculation Statement and the
accuracy of any of Purchaser's Proposed Calculations in accordance with
_Section 2.4_. During the Response Period, upon reasonable written request
Purchaser shall grant the Member Representative and its accountants reasonable
access to reasonably requested work papers, facilities, schedules and
calculations used in the preparation of the Final Closing Payment Calculation
Statement. If the Member Representative fails to notify Purchaser in writing
of any dispute within the Response Period, which notice shall state the basis
for the objection and shall be accompanied by the Member Representative's
alternative preparation of the Final Closing Payment Calculation Statement and
set forth in reasonable detail the Member Representative's calculation of the
Closing Payment Amount based on the Closing Indebtedness, Cash on Hand, the
Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Company Transaction Expenses and the
Change of Control Cash Payments (the " _Objection Notice_ "), then the Final
Closing Payment Calculation Statement and Purchaser's Proposed Calculations
shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and the Members. If the Member
Representative delivers an Objection Notice to Purchaser in accordance with
this _Section 2.4(b)_ , then the Member Representative and Purchaser shall in
good faith attempt to resolve any remaining disputed items and if any of such
items are not resolved within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Objection
Notice, then the Member Representative and Purchaser shall promptly select a
mutually acceptable and nationally recognized independent accounting firm
(such firm, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve the remaining
disputed items (the " _Remaining Disputed Items_ ") within thirty (30) days of
its engagement by conducting the Independent Accounting Firm's own review and
verification of the Final Closing Payment Calculation Statement. The Members,
Purchaser and the Company shall be bound by the determination of the Remaining
Disputed Items by the Independent Accounting Firm. The parties acknowledge
that Deloitte U.S. is a mutually acceptable firm to be designated as the
Independent Accounting Firm. Each of Purchaser and the Member Representative
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, an
engagement letter containing reasonable and customary terms. Purchaser and the
Member Representative shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
under this _Section 2.4(b)_. The Independent Accounting Firm's fees and
expenses shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Members, on the
other hand, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by Purchaser and the Members from the resolution of the
dispute. For example, if the Member Representative challenges an item by an
amount of $100,000 but the Independent Accounting Firm determines that the
Member Representative has a valid claim for only $40,000, then Purchaser shall
bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and the
Members shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the
provisions of this _Section 2.4(b)_, only the Remaining Disputed Items and
the determination of each amount of the Remaining Disputed Items shall be made
in accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement and the
provisions set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ and this _Section 2.4(b)_ and, in
any event, shall be no less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either
Purchaser or the Member Representative, and shall be no greater than the
greater of the amount claimed by either Purchaser or the Member
Representative.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_, of the
Final Closing Payment Calculation Statement and the final calculations of the
amounts of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital (and the

Entity. The assignments, endorsements, stock powers and other instruments of

(a) Each Member that acquires Purchaser Common Stock under this Agreement
is doing so for investment and for its own account, not as a nominee or agent,
and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof, and has no present intention of selling, granting any participation
in or otherwise distributing the same in violation of the Securities Act, this
Agreement, or any other Applicable Law. Such Member understands that the
shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued under this Agreement have not been
registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a specific exemption from

of such Member's representations as expressed in this _Section 3.6_.

  



  

(b) Each Member that acquires Purchaser Common Stock under this Agreement
acknowledges that, as of the date hereof, it has been afforded access to

it has considered necessary to make an informed decision with respect to its
acquisition of Purchaser Common Stock. Such Member acknowledges that no party

representation, express or implied, with respect to the accuracy, completeness
or adequacy of any available information except or to the extent such

representations, warranties and covenants of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement and the information set forth in filings with the SEC, such Member

investment, including a complete loss of the investment.

  



  

(d) Each Member that acquires Purchaser Common Stock under this Agreement
understands that the shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued under this
Agreement are characterized as "restricted securities" under Applicable Law
inasmuch as they are being acquired from Purchaser in a transaction not
involving a public offering and that under such Applicable Law, the Purchaser
Common Stock may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only
in certain limited circumstances. Such Member acknowledges that the Purchaser
Common Stock must be held indefinitely unless a sale of the Purchaser Common
Stock is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from
such registration is available.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) Each Member that acquires Purchaser Common Stock under this Agreement
understands and agrees that each book-entry record or certificate representing
the Purchaser Common Stock, any securities issued in respect thereof or

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR
RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND THE APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM. UNLESS SOLD
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, THE

PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

  



  

(f) Each Member that acquires Purchaser Common Stock under this Agreement
has had the opportunity to consult its own Tax advisors with respect to the

Member regarding the Tax consequences to such Member of the receipt or
ownership of the Purchaser Common Stock, including the Tax consequences under
Federal, state, local and other Applicable Law and the possible effects of
changes in such laws

  



  

(g) Each Member that acquires Purchaser Common Stock under this Agreement,
if an individual, is a resident of the state shown in the Company's records.
Such Member, if an entity, is duly organized, validly existing, and in good

The Company and the Members represent and warrant to Purchaser that:

  



  

4.1 _Corporate Organization and Qualification_. Each Company Entity is a

standing under the laws of the State of New Hampshire and is qualified and in
good standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction where the assets and
properties owned, leased or operated or the business conducted by it require
such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good
standing has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or adversely affect the Company's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, which jurisdictions are set
forth on _Schedule 4.1_. Each Company Entity has all requisite power and
authority (limited liability company authority or otherwise) to own its assets
and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
presently proposed to be conducted. The Company has previously delivered to
Purchaser true, complete and correct copies of the Organizational Documents,
each of which is in full force and effect. No Company Entity is in violation
of any of the provisions of its Organizational Documents. _Schedule 4.1_ sets

interest records of each Company Entity that are in possession of the Company
and that have been delivered to Purchaser are true, correct and complete, and
record therein all actions taken by its members and managers which have been
documented. The membership interest records and other records of each Company
Entity that are in possession of the Company accurately reflect all issuances
and record all transfers of each Company Entity's membership interests.

transfer restrictions, and were not issued in violation of Applicable Law, the
Organizational Documents, preemptive rights of any Person or any agreement to
which the Company or any past or current member of the Company was or is a
party. There are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, calls, rights
(including preemptive, purchase or subscription rights), conversion rights,
exchange rights, or other contracts or commitments or any other agreements of
any character which the Company is a party to, or may be bound by, requiring
it to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire any equity interests
or any securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing
the right to subscribe for, any equity interests of the Company. Except for
the Change of Control Payments, there are no outstanding or authorized unit
appreciation, phantom unit, unit plans, profit participation or similar rights
with respect to the Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies, member
agreements or other agreements or understandings with respect to the voting,

at any time has been insolvent within the meaning of Applicable Law.

  



  

   

  



  

4.3 _Authority; Binding Agreement_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The

limited liability company actions or proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This

4.7 _Financial Statements; Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) Attached hereto as _Schedule 4.7(a)_ are the following financial
statements of the Company Entities (collectively the " _Financial Statements_

Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the applicable Company Entities as of the dates thereof, and the
results of operation of the applicable Company Entities for the periods
indicated. The Financial Statements are consistent with the books and records
of the applicable Company Entities, which books and records are true, correct

qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing
has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect or adversely affect its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser has all requisite power and authority
(corporate or otherwise) to own its assets and properties and to carry on its

by Purchaser, will have been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Purchaser, and, assuming the Transaction Documents constitute valid and
binding agreements of the Company, the Member Representative and each of the
Members, will each constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of

to payment or benefit, or require the consent of any third party under any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, license, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Purchaser or any of its assets or properties
may be bound, except for such violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration or lien or other
charge or encumbrance) as to which requisite waivers or consents have been
obtained; or

  



  

(d) assuming the consents, approvals, exemptions, authorizations or
permits and registrations, qualifications, filings or notifications referred
to in this _Section 5.3_ are duly and timely obtained or made, violate any

to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or if any such Tax Return (whether original or
amended) prepared (or caused to be prepared) by Members and the Member
Representative relates to any period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period,

such Company Entity (except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable
Law) and the preparing party will give to the other party a copy of such Tax
Return before the filing thereof and at least forty-five (45) days prior to

transfer or assignment of property, or (C) required to be withheld, deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the
Closing Date; and

  



  

(ii) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire period.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Each party will, and each party will cause its applicable Affiliates
to, cooperate in all reasonable respects with respect to Tax matters and
provide one another with such information as is reasonably requested to enable

requirements. Such cooperation also will include promptly forwarding copies
(to the extent related thereto) of relevant Tax notices, forms or other
communications received from or sent to any Governmental Body (whether or not
requested); provided that the Member Representative and the Members shall
control any Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax Proceedings relating to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Purchaser (or the Company) shall control any
Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax Proceedings relating to any period after
the Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ _further_ , however, that the Members
and the Member Representative will not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any tax audits, inquiries or other Tax Proceedings
relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except that the Members and the Member Representative may admit any
liability with respect to, or settle or compromise, any tax audits, inquiries
or other Tax Proceedings to the extent relating to income Taxes of, or with
respect to, the Company Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period on without
Purchaser's consent.

Interests.

  



  

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Members when due, and the
Member Representative shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if
required by Applicable Law, the Company shall join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

(f) The Members and Purchaser agree that the taxable consideration
received by the Members shall be allocated among the assets of the Company

basis of assets for purposes of New Hampshire taxation, consistent with
paragraph (d) of this _Section 6.7_ , and (ii) the parties shall not allocate
more than $1,500,000 to covenants not to compete). A draft of the Allocation
Schedule shall be prepared by Purchaser and delivered to the Member
Representative within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date. If
the Member Representative notifies Purchaser in writing that the Member
Representative objects to one or more items reflected in the Allocation
Schedule, the Member Representative and Purchaser shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if the Member
Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to
the Allocation Schedule within 30 days following the delivery of the
Allocation Schedule, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne
equally by the Member Representative and Purchaser. The Members and Purchaser
shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund)
and information reports in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.
Any adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_
herein shall be require that the taxable gross income recognized by the
Members be reallocated in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule,
taking into account the residual allocation methodology required by Section
1060 of the Code.

  



  

   

  



  

(g) Purchaser shall not file an amended Tax Return that relates to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period without the Member Representative's approval, which
approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any refunds
or credits of Taxes of the Company plus any interest received with respect
thereto (net of any Taxes imposed on such interest) from the applicable Taxing
Authority for any Pre-Closing Period (including refunds or credits arising by
reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date) shall be for the
account of the Members to the extent such refund or credit of Tax was not
already taken into account for purposes of Net Working Capital or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement, and shall be paid by Purchaser to the Member
Representative for distribution to the Members within five (5) days after
Purchaser or the Company receives such refund or after the relevant Tax Return
is filed in which a credit is applied against Purchaser's or the Company's or
either of their successors' liability for Taxes. If any refunds or credits or
any related interest previously paid to the Members pursuant to this _Section
6.7(g)_ is required to be repaid to a Taxing Authority or is subsequently
disallowed by a Taxing Authority, the Members shall be required to repay
Purchaser such previously paid amounts. Refunds of Taxes for a period other
than a Pre-Closing period shall be for the account of Purchaser.

  



  

(h) Each of the Purchaser, the Company Entities and the Members agree: (i)

control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any contest
involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company;
provided that, in the case of a contest after the Closing Date that relates
solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or with respect to the portion of a
contest that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Members shall, at
the Members' expense, have the right to control the conduct, through counsel
of their own choosing, such contest or portion thereof. In the event of a
conflict between the provisions of this _Section 6.7(i)_ and _Section 6.7(g)_
, _Section 6.7(g)_ shall control.

Restricted Employee), (a) solicit, induce or encourage, in any manner
whatsoever, Kerry Hooper, Matt Sordillo or Steve Lynch (such individuals, the
" _Restricted Employees_ ") to diminish or end any employment or contracting
relationship with Paperless Parts unless such Restricted Employee's employment

by Paperless Parts more than twelve (12) months prior to such solicitation,
inducement or encouragement, with such twelve-month period beginning on the
date of termination of such Restricted Employee's employment or contracting
relationship with Paperless Parts, or (b) hire, employ or otherwise engage any
Restricted Employee unless such Restricted Employee's employment or
contracting relationship with Paperless Parts ended more than twelve (12)

Restricted Employee's employment or contracting relationship with Paperless
Parts. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.8_ , Purchaser
and the Company shall be entitled, for up to six (6) months after the Closing,

disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person, unless required
pursuant to Applicable Law or Legal Order, or use or otherwise exploit for his
or her own benefit or for the benefit of any Person other than the Company
Entities or Purchaser, any Confidential Information. In the event disclosure
of Confidential Information is required by Applicable Law or a Legal Order,
such Member shall provide the Company and Purchaser (if permissible) with
written notice of such requirement so that the Company and/or Purchaser may
seek, at its own expense, appropriate protections or limitations of such
disclosure, and each Member agrees to reasonably cooperate at the Company's or
Purchaser's expense in such protection efforts. With respect to trade secret
information, each Member's confidentiality/non-disclosure obligations shall
continue as long as such information constitutes a trade secret under
Applicable Law. With respect to any particular Confidential Information that
does not constitute a trade secret, each Member's confidentiality/non-
disclosure obligations shall continue until the earliest of: (i) the relevant
Company Entity or Purchaser ceases to maintain such information as
confidential; and (ii) such information is no longer Confidential Information.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreements, the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ will not
prohibit any disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right
or remedy related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein.
Each Member agrees that the terms of this _Section 6.9_ are reasonable, that a
breach of this _Section 6.9_ would cause irreparable injury to the Company
Entities and Purchaser, that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy
for any breach of this _Section 6.9_ and that, in addition to all other
remedies available hereunder or otherwise, the Company Entities and Purchaser,
jointly and/or severally, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including
specific performance and/or temporary and permanent injunctive relief (without
having to post any bond or other security), in the event of any such breach or
threatened breach.

listing application for the listing of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to
be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _NYSE
Listing Application_ ") and to cause such NYSE Listing Application to be
approved prior to the Closing Date. The Company and Purchaser will use
commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with respect to compliance with
New York Stock Exchange rules and regulations. The Company will cooperate with
Purchaser as reasonably requested by Purchaser with respect to the NYSE

will cause each Change of Control Payment Recipient to, cooperate with
Purchaser as reasonably requested by Purchaser and furnish to Purchaser and
the Transfer Agent information concerning each such Person as is customarily
provided pursuant to letters of transmittal that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section
6.10(b)_.

and will not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal
or modify any provision in the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses of any officers and directors (unless required by

directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be entitled to
such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full
extent of the law.

the Closing Date, covering the persons who are, as of and prior to the Closing
Date, covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance
policies with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to and on the
Closing Date, on terms which are no less favorable to such persons than the
terms of such current insurance in effect for the Company prior to the
Closing; provided, that if such "tail" insurance policy is not available at a
cost not greater than 200% of the annual premiums paid by the Company as of
the date hereof under the current DandO policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ "), then

has or may ever claim to have against any Released Party, whether known or

(collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "), excluding, however, those
obligations arising under or contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated herein or any document or

Member (on behalf of such Member and each of his, her or its applicable
Releasing Parties) shall refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any

behalf of such Member and each of his, her or its applicable Releasing
Parties) hereby acknowledges and agrees that if such Member or any of such
Releasing Parties should hereafter make any claim or demand or commence or
threaten to commence any Legal Action against any Released Party with respect

Purchaser and the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned by written
notice to the Member Representative at any time prior to the Closing, if (a)
the Company or the Members shall have failed to perform in any material

the Company in any material respect or adversely affect the Company's ability
to complete the transactions contemplated herein, or (c) any other condition
in _Section 7.2_ becomes incapable of fulfillment at Closing.

8.5_ and _Article IX_ of this Agreement shall survive termination. Each
party's rights of termination under this _Article VIII_ are in addition to
any other rights such party may have under this Agreement or otherwise and the
exercise of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies.

obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in

this _Article IX_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall notify the party or
parties obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") which notice, in the case of any
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ , shall be given to the Member
Representative, in writing in accordance with _Section 10.4_ of any claims
for indemnification under this Agreement (such notice, a " _Notice of Claim_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give
a Notice of Claim shall not limit or otherwise affect any right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent, if at all, that the
Indemnifying Party shall demonstrate that he or it was materially prejudiced
by such failure. Any Notice of Claim (i) shall be delivered prior to the
applicable Expiration Date, if any, and (ii) shall be made in good faith and
state the basis on and Losses for which indemnification is being asserted, to
the extent known by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Defense of Claims_. If the Notice of Claim involves a Legal Action
(including, without limitation, any audit, action or proceeding relating to
Taxes) instituted by any third party for which the Liability or the costs or
expenses are Losses (any such third party Legal Action or proceeding being
referred to as a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
(subject to any rights of an insurer under the Rep and Warranty Policy or any
other applicable insurance policy) (i) to employ counsel at its sole cost and
expense reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to defend any such
Claim asserted against the Indemnified Party, (ii) to control and conduct any
proceedings or negotiations in connection therewith and necessary or
appropriate to defend the Indemnified Party and (iii) to take all other steps
or proceedings to settle or defend any such Claims; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall only have the rights set forth in _Section
9.4(b)(i)_ through _(iii)_ if: (A) the defense of such Claim by the
Indemnifying Party will not, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party, have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party;
(B) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the good
faith reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of
any adverse monetary judgment that is reasonably likely to result; (C) the
amount of the potential Losses of the Indemnified Party related to such Claim
are not estimated to exceed the indemnification limits in _Section 9.5_ , (D)
the Claim solely seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages; (E) the Claim
does not include criminal charges and (F) the Indemnifying Party expressly
agrees in writing to be fully responsible for all Losses relating to such
Claim subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement **** (the
conditions set forth in clauses (A) through (E) are, collectively, the "
_Litigation Conditions_ "). The Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly as possible after receipt of the
Notice of Claim (but in any case within thirty (30) days of receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of a Notice of Claim or such earlier time necessary to
reasonably allow a timely response to the Claim (the " _Indemnity Notice
Period_ ") of its election to defend any such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such Claim, then (1) the Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim, (2)
the Indemnifying Party shall actively and diligently conduct the defense, and
(3) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such defense
(including with counsel of its choice) and receive copies of all notices,
pleadings and other submissions, at its own expense, and the Indemnifying
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in connection with
such participation. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (x) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; (y) any of the Litigation
Conditions ceases to be met; or (z) there exists a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be
waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party reasonably determines counsel is required. If the
Indemnifying Party does not deliver to the Indemnified Party written notice
within the Indemnity Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party will assume the
defense of any such Claim resulting therefrom, then the Indemnifying Party
will no longer have the right to assume the defense of such Claim, the
Indemnified Party may defend against any such Claim in such manner as it may
deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any
Losses that are ultimately determined to be owed under this _Article IX_
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed as to all material matters concerning such Claim. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to assume the defense of any Claim related to any matter set forth on
_Schedule 9.2(e)_ at its own cost and expense (but subject to the limitations
set forth herein), and defend against any such Claim in such manner as it may
deem appropriate, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to receive
copies of all notices, pleadings and other submissions, and the terms of
clause (c) below shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_ , to the Indemnified Party's
right to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such Claim; provided, however, to the extent that any such claim is
related to a customer of Purchaser or a Company Entity, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to assume the defense and the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to receive copies of all notices, pleadings and other
submissions, and the terms of clause (c) below shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_
, to the Indemnified Party's right to consent to a settlement of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any such Claim.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) _Settlement of Claims_. The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the
defense of any Claim as provided in this Agreement, may not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to a settlement of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any such Claim, except that no written consent
shall be necessary if the settlement (i) includes, as an unconditional term
thereof, the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party
of a release from all liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) does not grant
any injunctive or equitable relief or (iii) there is no finding or admission
of any violation of any law and no effect on any other claim that may be made
against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ , it shall not agree to any settlement
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_. Purchaser and the Members shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in the defense of any Claim and shall make available to the
party or parties defending such Claim such materials, assistance, and access
relating thereto as is reasonably requested from the first such Person.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a third party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")
shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof via Notice of Claim, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give a Notice of
Claim shall not limit or otherwise affect any right to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent, if at all, that the Indemnifying Party shall
demonstrate that he or it was materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, all Indemnifying
Parties shall be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged the correctness of
the claim or claims specified in the Notice of Claim for the full amount
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party shall make timely objection to a claim or
claims set forth in any Notice of Claim, and if such claim or claims shall not
have been resolved or compromised within sixty (60) days from the date of
delivery of such objection, the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

or agent of another entity (whether such claim is pursuant to any statute,

under _Section 9.2(e)_ , claims with respect to the Exclusions or claims for
which a Notice of Claim for indemnification out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
was delivered prior to the General Reps Expiration Date) shall be made solely
against the Rep and Warranty Policy so long as coverage is reasonably
available thereunder, and (b) recourse for any Purchaser Special Claims,
matters subject to indemnification under _Section 9.2(e)_ or the Exclusions
shall be made in accordance with _Section 9.9_.

  



  

9.9 _Recourse_. The recourse for claims by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
under this _Article IX_ shall be as follows:

  



  

(a) with respect to Losses in respect of claims under _Section 9.2(a)_ and
in respect of the Purchaser Special Claims (other than for Losses in respect
of the Exclusions), (i) first, to the extent coverage is reasonably available
thereunder, to the Rep and Warranty Policy, (ii) second, to the Indemnity

Funds, and (B) thereafter, to the Members on a joint and several basis.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuing coverage under the Rep and Warranty
Policy is not a condition to a Purchaser Indemnified Party submitting a Notice
of Claim and tolling the Expiration Date with respect to such claims or
initiating a claim with respect to the applicable portion of the Escrowed
Funds.

  



  

9.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that if

relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, the
operation of their respective businesses prior to the Closing, or any other
transaction or state of facts involving the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing (including any common law or statutory rights or remedies for
environmental, health, or safety matters) shall be solely in accordance with,
and limited by, the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.10_ to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall limit (a) any claims against the Company under this
Agreement if the Closing does not occur, (b) any claims for specific
performance, injunctive or declaratory relief, or other equitable remedies, or

before Closing, the Purchaser shall take all action reasonably necessary to
make the Rep and Warranty Policy effective. Purchaser agrees that, after the
date hereof, the Rep and Warranty Policy shall not be assigned, modified,
amended or waived in any respect in a manner that has any adverse effect on
the Members or the Member Representative, without the prior consent of the
Member Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

operation of law or otherwise, except that Purchaser may, at any time, in its
sole discretion, assign, in whole or in part, its rights and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates.

  



  

10.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of _Section 6.11_ and _Section

indemnified pursuant to such sections or are the intended beneficiaries
thereof, and the provisions of _Article IX_ shall inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Member Indemnified
Parties.

  



  

   

  



  

10.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and such term
shall be amended so that it is valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, but as close to the parties' original
intent as possible.

  



  

10.8 _Validity_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and
effect.

  



  

10.9 _Neutral Construction_. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement
was negotiated fairly between them at arms' length and that the final terms of
this Agreement are the product of the parties' negotiations. Each party

obligations affected hereby. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them, and that no

10.10 _Headings; Construction_. The descriptive headings of the Articles and
Sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that neither
the specifications of any dollar amount in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply that such amounts or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no party shall use the fact of setting of such amounts or
the fact of the inclusion of such item in the Schedules in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
is or is not material for purposes hereof, except as it relates to the
disclosure of that item in response to any representation or warranty. The
Exhibits and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof. A disclosure on any Schedule shall be
considered disclosed for purposes of other Schedules so long as it is
reasonably apparent on its face and due to its description that such
disclosure should apply for purposes of such other Schedules. In no event will
the mere listing in a Schedule of a document or other item alone be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty in the
Agreement unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence
of the document or other item itself. In this Agreement (a) words denoting the
singular include the plural and vice versa, (b) words denoting any gender
include all genders, (c) any reference to a statute means the statute and any
regulations thereunder in force as of the date of this Agreement unless
otherwise expressly provided, (d) when calculating the period of time within
which or following which any act is to be done or steps taken, the date which
is the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the
last day of such period is not a business day ( _i.e._ , a Saturday, Sunday or
day which is a statutory holiday under the laws of the United States or the
State of Minnesota), then the period shall end on the next day which is a
business day and the word "day" means calendar day unless otherwise specified,
(e) any reference to "best efforts" or "commercially reasonable efforts" or
"reasonable efforts" herein does not include any obligation to pay, or
guarantee the payment of, money or other consideration to any third party
relating to obtaining any consent, approval or waiver with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (f) reference to any agreement,
document, or instrument means such agreement, document or instrument as
amended or modified and in effect from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof, (g) "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto," and words of similar
import shall be deemed references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section or other provision hereof, and (h) reference to
Schedules, Exhibits, Sections, etc., is to Schedules, Exhibits, Sections, etc.
of this Agreement unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

  



  

   

  



  

10.11 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICTING PROVISION
OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT
WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO
BE APPLIED. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREUNDER.

  



  

10.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES AND CONSENTS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT SITTING IN the State of DElaware AND THE

HEREBY, WAIVES ALL OBJECTIONS BASED ON LACK OF VENUE AND FORUM NON CONVENIENS,
AND IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF ALL SUCH COURTS.

  



  

10.13 _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart
being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall
together constitute the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, PDF file or other means of
electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

  



  

10.14 _Further Assurances; Cooperation After Closing_. The Members shall
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and the Company after the Closing, and
shall cause their representatives to cooperate, to ensure the orderly
transition of the ownership of the Company and its business and to minimize
any disruption to the Company's business that might result from the
transactions contemplated hereby. From time to time, as and when reasonably
requested by a party hereto, each party hereto shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such
other party may reasonably deem necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

10.15 _Member Representative_.

Member Representative, (" _Member Representative_ ") to act as the agent,
proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Member for all purposes under this
Agreement (including full power and authority to act on the Members' behalf).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Member Representative will
be authorized to: (i) in connection with the Closing, execute and receive all
documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of
and in the name of the Members necessary to effectuate the Closing and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) take all
actions on behalf of the Members with respect to the matters set forth in
_Articles I_ and _II_ ; (iii) take all actions on behalf of the Members in
connection with any claims made under _Article IX_ to defend or settle such
claims, and to make payments in respect of such claims; (iv) execute and
deliver, should it elect to do so in its sole discretion, on behalf of the
Members, any amendment to this Agreement so long as such amendment will apply
equally to all Members; and (v) take all other actions to be taken by or on
behalf of the Members and exercise any and all rights which the Members are
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Liability_. Member Representative will not be liable to any Member for
any action taken by it in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, and the
Members will jointly and severally indemnify Member Representative from any
Losses arising out of its serving as Member Representative hereunder (the "
_Representative Expenses_ "). Member Representative is serving in that
capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Members
hereunder, and Purchaser agrees that it will not look to the personal assets
of Member Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any
obligations to be performed by the Members hereunder.

  



  

10.16 _Representation of the Members and their Affiliates_. Purchaser agrees,
on its own behalf and on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, that,
following the Closing, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. may
serve as counsel to the Members and their Affiliates in connection with any
matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding any representation by Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and
Popeo, P.C. prior to the Closing Date of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser and the Company (and the Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have that Mintz,
Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Members and their
Affiliates, on the other hand, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo,
P.C. may represent the Members or any of their Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Purchaser
and/or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and even though Mintz, Levin,
Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. may have represented the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute and may
have confidential information learned in the prior representation that is
relevant to such dispute. Purchaser and the Company also further agree that,
as to all communications among Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo,
P.C. (or other counsel to the Company or its Subsidiaries) and the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries and the Members or the Members Affiliates and
representatives, that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Members and may be controlled by the Members and
will not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries. Purchaser, the Company and/or any of their Affiliates shall not
attempt to control or access, examine or use such privileged communications of
the Members, including any electronic versions or copies of such
communications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Purchaser or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a third party other than a party to this Agreement, on the other
hand, after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Mintz, Levin, Cohn,
Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Members.

  



  

   

  



  

10.17 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by Purchaser in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by Purchaser. It is accordingly agreed that the Company
and Members will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof against Purchaser in any court having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which the Company or Members are
entitled at law or in equity.
