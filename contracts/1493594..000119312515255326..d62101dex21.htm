after the date of such delivery (such period, the &#147;<B>Dispute Period</B>&#148;) to dispute any elements of or amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet that affect the calculation of the final Purchase Price or any error in the
determination of the final Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement (the &#147;<B>Dispute</B>&#148;), but only on the basis that the amounts reflected in the Closing Statement are inaccurate or were not prepared in accordance with the
requirements of <B>Section&nbsp;2.5</B>. If Seller does not deliver to Purchaser within the Dispute Period a written notice of the Dispute that sets forth in reasonable detail the elements and amounts with which Seller disagrees (the
&#147;<B>Dispute Notice</B>&#148;), then the Closing Statement will be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller in the form in which it was delivered to Seller and will be final and binding upon the Parties. If Seller delivers the
Dispute Notice to Purchaser within the Dispute Period, then Purchaser and Seller will attempt to resolve the Dispute and agree in writing upon the final content of the disputed Closing Statement within 15 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice.
Any amounts reflected in the Closing Statement that are not disagreed to by Seller in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller and will be final and binding upon the Parties. If Seller and Purchaser are unable
to resolve each element of the Dispute within such 15-day period, Purchaser will within 15 days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, notify Seller of its disagreement, which notice will set forth in reasonable detail the elements and amounts with
which Purchaser disagrees (the &#147;<B>Dispute Response</B>&#148;). If Purchaser does not deliver to Seller within such 15-day period a Dispute Response, then Seller&#146;s calculation of the Purchase Price as set forth in the Dispute Notice will
be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Purchaser. Additionally, those items in the Dispute Response which Seller and Purchaser are able to agree in writing within such 15-day period shall be considered final and binding upon the
Parties.<B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B></B>(b) If Purchaser timely delivers the Dispute Response, Purchaser and Seller will jointly engage as the arbitrator

accounting, tax or auditing services for Purchaser, Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates during the past three years (such Person, the &#147;<B>Arbitrating Accountant</B>&#148;). If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on
the identity of the Arbitrating Accountant within 15 days after Purchaser&#146;s delivery of the Dispute Response, either Seller or Purchaser may request that the American Arbitration Association appoint an independent third party accounting firm
meeting the aforementioned requirements to serve as the Arbitrating Accountant. The Arbitrating Accountant&#146;s sole function will be to resolve each element of the Dispute that has not been resolved by Seller and Purchaser, to revise the Closing

review to the unresolved elements or amounts set forth in the Dispute Notice and the Dispute Response. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at its discretion, conduct one or more conferences concerning the Dispute, at which conferences each of Seller and
Purchaser will have the right to present additional documents, materials and other information they reasonably deem are relevant to the Arbitrating Accountant&#146;s determination and to have present their respective advisors, counsel and
accountants; provided that Purchaser and Seller will be limited by their respective positions in the Dispute Notice and the Dispute Response. In connection with the resolution of the Dispute, there shall not be any other hearings or oral

decision on each element in the Dispute in writing to Seller and Purchaser, together with a revised Closing Balance Sheet reflecting its decision and a revised Closing Statement reflecting its calculation of the Purchase Price based on the elements
and amounts reflected on the revised Closing Balance Sheet. In resolving the Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant will be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and may not revise any element of the Closing Balance Sheet that is not contested in
the Dispute Notice or the Dispute Response or assign a value to any disputed element of the Closing Balance Sheet greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Party in the Dispute Notice or the Dispute Response. Each of the Arbitrating Accountant&#146;s decision, the revised Closing Balance Sheet and the revised calculation of the Purchase Price will be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment may
be entered on the award. Seller and Purchaser shall share the fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant in inverse proportion to the relative amounts subject to the Dispute determined in favor of such Party, in accordance with the following
formulas: (i)&nbsp;Purchaser shall pay a portion of such fees and expenses equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar amount subject to the Dispute resolved in favor of Seller and the
denominator of which is the total dollar amount subject to the Dispute and (ii)&nbsp;Seller shall pay a portion of such fees and expenses equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar amount
subject to the Dispute resolved in favor of Purchaser and the denominator of which is the total dollar amount subject to the Dispute. </P>
