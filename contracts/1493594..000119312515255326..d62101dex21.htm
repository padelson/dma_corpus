Price (the "Closing Estimate Payment") based upon the most recent

(b) If the final Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Estimate Payment
(such excess, the "Excess Amount"), then Purchaser will pay to Seller, within
two Business Days following the final determination of the final Purchase
Price, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Seller, an amount in cash equal to the Excess Amount.

(c) If the final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Estimate Payment
(such shortfall, the "Shortfall Amount"), then Seller shall, within two
Business Days following the final determination of the final Purchase Price,
pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the Shortfall Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Purchaser.

Section 2.5 Preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. The amount of Working
Capital, Indebtedness, and Transaction Expenses included in the calculation of
the Purchase Price will be determined from a balance sheet of the Company as
of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). The
Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared by Purchaser in accordance with GAAP.
Purchaser shall deliver Purchasers calculation of the Purchase Price and the
Closing Balance Sheet (collectively, the "Closing Statement") to Seller on or
before the date that is 60 days after the Closing Date. The Parties agree that
the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining Working
Capital, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the final Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.5 is to adjust for inaccuracies in the estimates of
the amounts of Working Capital, Indebtedness, and Transaction Expenses set
forth in the Pre-Closing Statement and to determine the final Purchase Price,
and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different
judgments, accounting

 



15  methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet or determining the amounts of Working Capital, Indebtedness, or
Transaction Expenses or the final Purchase Price. Notwithstanding any changes
to the foregoing items under this Section 2.5, the Closing Balance Sheet will
be deemed issued immediately prior to the Closing for purposes of GAAP and
for purposes of determining the impact of any subsequent events on the Closing
Balance Sheet.

 

Section 2.6 Disputes Regarding Closing Balance Sheet.

 

(a) Seller will have from the time the Closing Statement is delivered to it
until 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the date that is 30 days after the date of
such delivery (such period, the "Dispute Period") to dispute any elements of
or amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet that affect the calculation
of the final Purchase Price or any error in the determination of the final
Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement (the "Dispute"), but only on
the basis that the amounts reflected in the Closing Statement are inaccurate
or were not prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.5. If
Seller does not deliver to Purchaser within the Dispute Period a written
notice of the Dispute that sets forth in reasonable detail the elements and
amounts with which Seller disagrees (the "Dispute Notice"), then the Closing
Statement will be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller in the
form in which it was delivered to Seller and will be final and binding upon
the Parties. If Seller delivers the Dispute Notice to Purchaser within the
Dispute Period, then Purchaser and Seller will attempt to resolve the Dispute
and agree in writing upon the final content of the disputed Closing Statement
within 15 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice. Any amounts reflected in
the Closing Statement that are not disagreed to by Seller in the Dispute
Notice shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller and will
be final and binding upon the Parties. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve each element of the Dispute within such 15-day period, Purchaser will
within 15 days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, notify Seller of its
disagreement, which notice will set forth in reasonable detail the elements
and amounts with which Purchaser disagrees (the "Dispute Response"). If
Purchaser does not deliver to Seller within such 15-day period a Dispute
Response, then Sellers calculation of the Purchase Price as set forth in the
Dispute Notice will be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by
Purchaser. Additionally, those items in the Dispute Response which Seller and
Purchaser are able to agree in writing within such 15-day period shall be
considered final and binding upon the Parties.

(b) If Purchaser timely delivers the Dispute Response, Purchaser and Seller
will jointly engage as the arbitrator of the Dispute one or more independent
members of the dispute resolution group of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if
such Person refuses to accept such appointment, another nationally recognized
certified public accounting firm that has not performed accounting, tax or
auditing services for Purchaser, Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates during the past three years (such Person, the
"Arbitrating Accountant"). If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the
identity of the Arbitrating Accountant within 15 days after Purchasers
delivery of the Dispute Response, either Seller or Purchaser may request that
the American Arbitration Association appoint an independent third party
accounting firm meeting the aforementioned requirements to serve as the
Arbitrating Accountant. The Arbitrating Accountants sole function will be to
resolve each element of the Dispute that has not been resolved by Seller and
Purchaser, to revise the Closing Balance Sheet to reflect such resolutions
and to calculate the Purchase Price based on the elements and amounts
reflected on the revised Closing Balance Sheet.

 



16 (c) In connection with the resolution of the Dispute, the Arbitrating
Accountant will limit its review to the unresolved elements or amounts set
forth in the Dispute Notice and the Dispute Response. The Arbitrating
Accountant may, at its discretion, conduct one or more conferences concerning
the Dispute, at which conferences each of Seller and Purchaser will have the
right to present additional documents, materials and other information they
reasonably deem are relevant to the Arbitrating Accountants determination and
to have present their respective advisors, counsel and accountants; provided
that Purchaser and Seller will be limited by their respective positions in the
Dispute Notice and the Dispute Response. In connection with the resolution of
the Dispute, there shall not be any other hearings or oral examinations,
testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar Proceedings. Each of Seller
and Purchaser will make available to the other Party and the Arbitrating
Accountant, as the case may be, such documents, books, records, work
papers, facilities, personnel and other information as such Party or the
Arbitrating Accountant may reasonably request to review the Closing Balance
Sheet and to resolve the Dispute.

 

(d) The Arbitrating Accountant will as promptly as possible, and in any event
within 15 days after the date of its appointment, render its decision on each
element in the Dispute in writing to Seller and Purchaser, together with a
revised Closing Balance Sheet reflecting its decision and a revised Closing
Statement reflecting its calculation of the Purchase Price based on the
elements and amounts reflected on the revised Closing Balance Sheet. In
resolving the Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant will be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement and may not revise any element of the Closing
Balance Sheet that is not contested in the Dispute Notice or the Dispute
Response or assign a value to any disputed element of the Closing Balance
Sheet greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party in the
Dispute Notice or the Dispute Response. Each of the Arbitrating Accountants
decision, the revised Closing Balance Sheet and the revised calculation of the
Purchase Price will be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment
may be entered on the award. Seller and Purchaser shall share the fees and
expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant in inverse proportion to the relative
amounts subject to the Dispute determined in favor of such Party, in
accordance with the following formulas: (i) Purchaser shall pay a portion of
such fees and expenses equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar amount subject to the Dispute
resolved in favor of Seller and the denominator of which is the total dollar
amount subject to the Dispute and (ii) Seller shall pay a portion of such fees
and expenses equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the dollar amount subject to the Dispute resolved
in favor of Purchaser and the denominator of which is the total dollar amount
subject to the Dispute.

 

Section 2.7 Earn Out Payment.

 

(a) If, as of the close of business on September 30, 2019, the sum of (i) the
total revenue (determined in accordance with GAAP) of Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company) resulting from sales of ECUs from the
Closing up to and including September 30, 2019 (the "Product Revenue") and
(ii) the total dollar value of committed customer orders

 



17  received by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company) for ECUs
that have been scheduled for delivery to such customer and represented by
valid purchase orders as of the close of business on September 30, 2019 (the
"Product Orders") equals or exceeds $86,700,000 (the "Earn Out Benchmark"),
Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount of $30,000,000; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the aggregate amount of the Product Revenue and the
Product Orders is less than the Earn Out Benchmark, then Purchaser shall pay
to Seller an amount equal to (i) $30,000,000 multiplied by (ii)
the percentage of the Earn Out Benchmark represented by the aggregate amount
of the Product Revenue and the Product Orders, all as more particularly set
forth in this Section 2.7. Any payment due under this Section 2.7 is referred
to herein as the "Earn Out Payment" and is subject to Purchasers right of
offset set forth in Section 10.3(i).

 

(b) Within 60 days of the expiration of the Earn Out Period, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller, with reasonable detail, its calculation of the Earn Out
Payment, if any, and the components thereof. The Earn Out Payment shall be
determined and calculated in accordance with GAAP. Following receipt of the
calculation of the Earn Out Payment, if any, Seller shall be afforded a period
of 30 days to review the same. To assist in any such review, Purchaser shall
reasonably make available to Seller, upon request and during normal business
hours, worksheets and other papers prepared in connection with the preparation
of the calculation of the Earn Out Payment and the components thereof. At or
before the end of the 30-day review period (the "Earn Out Review Period"),
Seller shall either accept the calculation of the applicable Earn Out Payment
or deliver to Purchaser a written notice disputing the same (a "Earn Out
Dispute Notice") setting forth a reasonable description of Sellers objections
and the amount of the adjustment to the Earn Out Payment which Seller believes
should be made. Any items not identified within the Earn Out Dispute Notice
shall be considered final and binding upon the Parties. If Purchasers
calculation of the Earn Out Payment reflects that the Earn Out Payment is due
to Seller and Seller objects in the Earn Out Dispute Notice that such
calculated amount is too small, then, within five Business Days following
Sellers delivery of the Earn Out Dispute Notice, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller Purchasers calculated amount of such Earn Out Payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions given
by Seller to Purchaser, and the Parties shall proceed with the provisions of
Section 2.7(c) as to the amount of the additional Earn Out Payment Seller
believes is due to Seller. If no Earn Out Dispute Notice is delivered within
the Earn Out Review Period, then the calculation of the Earn Out Payment shall
be deemed to have been accepted by Seller.

 

(c) In the event that an Earn Out Dispute Notice is delivered in accordance
with Section 2.7(b), Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve the objections set forth therein within 30 days of Purchasers receipt
of such Earn Out Dispute Notice. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve
all of the objections set forth in the Earn Out Dispute Notice within such
30-day period, any remaining objections related to the calculation of the Earn
Out Payment shall be finally resolved by the Arbitrating Accountant who shall
resolve any remaining disagreements in accordance with the provisions set
forth in Sections 2.6(b), (c) and (d) _ mutatis mutandis_. Purchaser and
Seller shall fully cooperate with the Arbitrating Accountant. The decision of
the Arbitrating Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties,
except in the case of manifest error.

 



18 (d) Upon final determination of the amount of the Earn Out Payment in
accordance with Section 2.7(b) or Section 2.7(d) (the "Determination Date"),
Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Earn Out Payment, as applicable, as finally
determined within five Business Days of the Determination Date, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions given
by Seller to Purchaser.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Product Revenue
following the Closing and prior to September 30, 2019 exceeds the Earn Out
Benchmark, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller $30,000,000 within ten days
after the end of the calendar month in which the Product Revenue first
exceeds the Earn Out Benchmark, and thereafter no additional payments will be
required pursuant to this Section 2.7. Any payment due under this Section
2.7(e) is subject to Purchasers right of offset set forth in Section
10.3(i).

(f) From the Closing Date until September 30, 2019 (the "Earn Out Period"),
Purchaser covenants and agrees to the following: (i) Purchaser shall keep
records sufficient to calculate the Earn Out Payment; (ii) upon Sellers
request during normal business hours, Purchaser shall reasonably make
available to Seller and its advisors the records, worksheets and other
supporting workpapers prepared in connection with the calculation of the Earn
Out Payment for any period covered by this Agreement; (iii) neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) shall take any action that
is primarily intended to impede Sellers ability to earn the maximum Earn Out
Payment; and (iv) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company) shall
operate the Business during the Earn Out Period in a commercially reasonable
manner; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Earn Out Payment is paid to Seller
prior to the expiration of the Earn Out Period as set forth in Section
2.7(e), Purchasers obligations set forth in this Section 2.7(f) shall
terminate on the date the Earn Out Payment is paid to Seller. For purposes of
this Section 2.7(f), "commercially reasonable manner" means, among other
things, providing the Business with a level of administrative, development,
maintenance, internal or outsourced manufacturing, quality, sales and
marketing support that is consistent with the support currently being provided
to the Business by Seller and providing the Business with working capital
funding that is appropriate for a business of the Business size and industry.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SELLER

 

The Company and Seller, jointly and severally, hereby make the representations
and warranties with respect to itself, the Company and the Business, as
applicable, to Purchaser that are set forth in this Article III.

Section 3.1 Organization, Existence and Good Standing. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the state of Delaware. The Company has full corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to
carry on the Business as presently conducted and is qualified as a foreign
corporation and is duly qualified or authorized to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the Laws of all jurisdictions where
the nature of the Business or the nature and location of its assets requires
such qualification and where the failure to so qualify would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.2 Power and Authority; Authorization and Execution. The Company has
full corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is, or at
the Closing will be, a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of, and the performance of the
Companys obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is, or at the Closing will be, a party by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is, or at the
Closing will be, a party have been duly and validly approved by the board of
directors of the Company. No other approvals or actions are necessary on the
part of the Company to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Company is, or
at the Closing will be, a party and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Company.

Section 3.3 Enforceability. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforcement may be affected by
Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and creditors rights
and by the availability of injunctive relief, specific performance and other
equitable remedies (collectively, "Enforceability Exceptions"). At the
Closing, the Transaction Documents to be executed and delivered by the
Company will be duly executed and delivered by the Company and will constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance
with their terms, except to the extent enforcement may be affected by
Enforceability Exceptions.

Section 3.4 Consents; Non-contravention. Except for filings under the United
States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act")
and as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not
required to give any 

 



22  notice to, make any filing with or obtain any authorization, consent, Order
or approval of any Person in connection with the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
Company is, or at the Closing will be, a party or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and therein, except for any such notice,
filing, authorization, consent, Order or approval the failure of which to
make or obtain would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, including the Contribution Agreement, to which
the Company is, or at the Closing will be, a party, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein and therein: (a) will violate any
provision of the Governing Documents of the Company; (b) will conflict with,
result in a breach of, or constitute a default or an event creating rights of
acceleration, termination, modification or cancellation or a loss of rights
under, any Material Contract, permit, indenture, mortgage, debenture, note or
other instrument to which the Company or the Business is a party, subject or
otherwise bound; (c) violate any applicable Law or Order to which the Company
or any of the assets or businesses of the Company is subject or otherwise
bound; or (d) will result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other
than a Permitted Lien) upon any of the Shares or any Business Assets, except,
in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for any such conflict, breach,
default, event, loss, violation, creation or imposition as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 Capitalization; Subsidiaries. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 750 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, all
of which are issued and outstanding and none of which are held by the Company
as treasury stock. Seller is the record and beneficial owner of all the
Shares, free and clear of any and all Liens other than any restrictions on
transferability imposed pursuant to securities Laws. The Shares have been
validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. There are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, rights (including preemptive rights),
calls, convertible securities or other agreements or commitments of any
character obligating the Company to issue, sell or transfer any equity
securities of any kind. The Company is not a party to, or otherwise bound by,
and has not granted, any stock appreciation rights, participations, phantom
equity or similar rights. The Company does not hold or beneficially own any
direct or indirect interest in any Person (whether it be common or
preferred stock or any comparable ownership interest in any Person that is
not a corporation), or any subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
convertible securities or other agreements or commitments for any interest in
any Person.

 

Section 3.6 Financial Statements. Copies of the internally-prepared balance
sheets and statements of income of the Business as of and for the 12-month
periods ended September 30, 2012, September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2014
and the six-month period ended March 31, 2015 (the "Financial Statements") are
contained in Section 3.6 of the Disclosure Schedule. The Financial Statements
have been prepared from the books and records of Seller and its Affiliates and
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Business as of the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows
of the Business for the periods covered by such statements, in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied through the periods covered thereby, except as
disclosed therein and except for (a) normal and customary year-end
adjustments, (b) the omission of footnote disclosures required by GAAP, and
(c) the exceptions set forth in Section 3.6 of the Disclosure Schedule. For
the purposes hereof, the balance sheet of the Company as of July 3, 2015 is
referred to as the "Balance Sheet," and July 3, 2015 is referred to as the
"Balance Sheet Date."

 



23 Section 3.7 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Seller nor the Company has
any liabilities, obligations or commitments of any nature whatsoever,
asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, accrued or
unaccrued, matured or unmatured or otherwise ("Liabilities") that would be
required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except (a) those which are adequately reflected or reserved against in the
Balance Sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date, (b) those which have been incurred
in the Ordinary Course of Business since the Balance Sheet Date, and (c)
those incurred in connection with the Transaction Documents or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The
books, records, and accounts of Seller or its Affiliates maintained with
respect to the Business accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail,
the transactions and the assets and Liabilities of Seller with respect to the
Business. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule,
prior to the contribution of the Business Assets and the assignment of the
Assumed Liabilities to the Company pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the
Company will have no Liabilities.

of the Disclosure Schedule is a true and correct list of all of the material
tangible assets which are owned by Seller or the Company and used in the
Business. Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Disclosure Schedule,

interest in, all of the tangible assets used in the conduct of the Business,
in each case free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Except as
set forth in Section 3.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, upon completion of the
transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement and the related
transfer agreements, the tangible rights, assets and properties of the Company
will include all of the material tangible rights, assets and
properties necessary to conduct the Business as currently conducted. The
tangible assets which are owned by Seller or the Company and used in the
Business, taken as a whole, are in good operating condition and repair, normal
wear and tear excepted.

 

Section 3.9 Insurance. Prior to the Closing, Seller or the Company has
maintained insurance policies in scope and amounts sufficient for all
requirements of applicable Law with respect to the Business and the Business
Assets. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 of the Disclosure Schedule, there
are no claims related to Business or the Business Assets pending under any
such insurance policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or
disputed or in respect of which there is an outstanding reservation of rights,
in each case, by the applicable insurance carrier in a written notice.
Neither Seller nor the Company is in material default under, nor has
otherwise failed to comply in any material respect with, any material
provision contained in any such insurance policy.

 

Section 3.10 Taxes.

 

(a) The Company has filed all Tax Returns that were required to be filed on or
prior to the due date for such Tax Returns. The Company has paid all Taxes
due and owing by Company (whether or not shown on any Tax Return). All Tax

respects. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due or

24 (b) As of the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in the Financial
Statements, the unpaid Taxes of the Company that were not yet due and payable
did not exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for

established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth or included on the Closing Balance Sheet.

Company has not been the subject of any audit, investigation or notice of a
deficiency or proposed adjustment by any Governmental Authority with respect
to Taxes or Tax Returns for which the statute of limitations has not expired.
No Governmental Authority has issued to Company (i) a written notice that
remains in effect and indicates an intention to open an audit or other review
or (ii) a written request that remains in effect for information relating
to Taxes. No waivers of statutes of limitation with respect to the Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company are currently in effect. To the Companys
Knowledge, no written claim has ever been made by any Governmental Authority
in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

law). No employee of the Company is a covered employee within the meaning of
Section 162(m)(3) of the Code with respect to Holdings.

 



25 (j) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in, or

by Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section

payable by the consolidated group of which Holdings was the common parent have
been paid for each taxable period during which the Company was included in
such consolidated income Tax Return filed by Holdings. All such Tax Returns
were correct and complete in all respects.

 



26 (p) There is no dispute or claim in writing concerning any additional income
tax against Holdings or its Subsidiaries for any taxable period involving a
consolidated income Tax Return of Holdings and during which the Company was a
member of the consolidated group of which Holdings was the common parent. No

46 Section 6.6 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

 

(a) For a period of five years from and after the Closing Date, Holdings and
Seller shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, anywhere in the
world, directly or indirectly, own, manage, engage in, operate, control, work
for, consult with, render services for, do business with, maintain any
interest in (proprietary, financial or otherwise) or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or control of, any business, whether in
corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in
designing, developing, marketing and/or selling products used in the
automotive sector that are substantially equivalent to, or that compete with,
the products that are the subject of the Business as currently conducted,
(excluding any component parts, services or Software), (a "Restricted
Business");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions contained in this
Section 6.6(a) shall not restrict the acquisition by Holdings or Seller,
directly or indirectly, of (i) an aggregate of less than 2% of the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a
Restricted Business or (ii) any Person or business engaged in a Restricted
Business if at the time of such acquisition such Restricted Business generated
20% or less of such Persons or business total revenues in the 12 month
period immediately preceding the date of such acquisition. The Parties
specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of
the foregoing will be inadequate and that Purchaser, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting
any bond whatsoever.

 

(b) For a period of three years from and after the Closing Date, Holdings and
Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause their Affiliates not to, anywhere in
the world directly or indirectly: (i) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any
Company Employee to leave such employment with Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or hire, employ or otherwise engage any Company Employee or (ii)
cause, induce or encourage any client, customer, supplier or licensor of the
Company or the Business (including any existing or former customer of the
Company or the Business) or any other Person who has a material business
relationship with the Company or the Business, to terminate or modify any
such relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be permitted
(A) to hire any Company Employee who works for or supports the operation of
the Business from and after the 180th day such Company Employee ceases to be
employed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (B) to conduct any general
solicitations in a newspaper, trade publication or other periodical or web
posting not specifically targeted at any Company Employee, and (C) to
participate in job fairs, career fairs or similar recruiting events.

 

(c) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6.6 relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this Section 6.6 will cause irreparable
injury to the parties, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore, Purchaser
will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief
from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Section 6.6, without the need to post bond or prove
actual damages. The rights and remedies

 



47  provided by this Section 6.6 are cumulative and in addition to any other
rights and remedies which Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or in equity.
Purchasers ability to enforce its rights under this Section 6.6 or
applicable law against Holdings or Seller shall not be impaired in any way by
the existence of a claim or cause of action on the part of Holdings or Seller
based on, or arising out of, this Agreement or any other event or
transaction.

(d) The parties agree that the provisions of this Section 6.6 are reasonable
with respect to the specified time periods, specified geographical areas,
specified business limitation, and in all other respects. The parties agree
that it is their intention that the provisions of this Section 6.6
be enforced in accordance with their terms to the maximum extent permitted by
law. Each of the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be considered and
construed as a separate and independent covenant. Should any part or provision
of any of the provisions of this Section 6.6 be held invalid, void, or
unenforceable, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render
invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision of this Agreement
or the provision in question. The parties hereto agree that, if any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that a specified time period, a specified
geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant
feature of this Section 6.6 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public
policy, then the court shall substitute for the provision in question a lesser
period of time, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant
feature that is determined to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against
public policy, and the court shall enforce such modified provision against the
applicable party. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
6.6 shall not apply to any future acquirer of all of the stock or all or
substantially all of the assets of Holdings.

Section 6.7 Confidentiality. For a period of five years from and after the
Closing Date, Holdings and Seller shall not, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its or their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than
authorized officers, directors and employees of Purchaser or use or otherwise
exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser
and its Affiliates, any and all confidential or proprietary information,
whether written or oral, concerning the Company, the Business or the
Transferred Assets ("Confidential Information"). The term Confidential
Information does not include information which (a) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or
its Affiliates in breach hereof, (b) is independently developed by Holdings,
Seller or any of their Subsidiaries after the Closing Date without use of or
reference to any Confidential Information, or (c) becomes available to
Holdings, Seller or any of their Subsidiaries after the Closing Date on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser or any of
its representatives, _provided, that_ , to the knowledge of Holdings, Seller
or such Subsidiary, such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality
to, Purchaser, or any other party with respect to such information. Seller
may disclose such Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure
thereof is required by Law, court order, rules or regulations of any
securities exchange, court, mediator, judge, arbitrator or other Person;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is so required, Holdings
or Seller, as applicable, shall, to the extent reasonably possible and if
permitted to do so, provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirement
prior to making any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate
protective order. If Holdings, Seller or any of their Subsidiaries or their
respective representatives are required to 

 



48  disclose any Confidential Information, such Person shall use its
commercially reasonably efforts to disclose only that portion of such
Confidential Information which such Person is advised by its counsel to
disclose. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall

Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or
assessment relating to the Company, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any Tax claim or assessment relating to Company, or take any other similar
action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or payment of any Tax, if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action shall have the effect of materially increasing the
Tax liability of the Company for any period ending after the Closing Date or
materially decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company existing on the Closing
Date.

 

Section 6.9 Amendment to Convertible Promissory Note. Prior to Closing, or
within a reasonable period thereafter, Seller, with the assistance of the
Company and the Company Employees, will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the amendment and restatement of the Convertible Promissory Note made
between Seller, as lender, and Inventek LLC, as borrower, dated March 11,
2014, to replace Seller with the Company as the lender thereunder.

Section 7.1 Confidentiality Agreement. That certain letter agreement dated
April 17, 2015 between Purchaser and Seller (the "Confidentiality Agreement")
is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference and made a part of
this Agreement and will survive the execution of this Agreement
notwithstanding the terms thereof. If a conflict arises between the
provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement will control.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this Section 7.1 will
terminate upon the Closing or, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article XII, then the date that is three years after the termination of this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.2 Labor Matters.

 

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
offer employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates effective on the
Closing Date to each employee of the Business employed by Seller or one its
Affiliates set forth on Section 7.2 of the Disclosure Schedule (each, a
"Company Employee"), such offers to (i) provide that such employee will
receive at least the same salary amounts and cash bonus opportunity as in
effect with Seller, the Company or one of their respective Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing,  

 



49  and employee benefits, including, retirement, health, disability, life
insurance and other welfare benefits, but excluding equity or equity-based
compensation, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided
to similarly-situated employees of Purchaser or the employing Affiliate, as
applicable, as of the date hereof, and (ii) not require such employee to work
more than 50 miles from his or her current work location other than travel
reasonably required to carry out the responsibilities of his or her position
with the Company (collectively, the "Minimum Employment Terms"). For the one-
year period following the Closing Date, Purchaser will provide or will cause
the employing Affiliate to provide all Company Employees in its employ the
Minimum Employment Terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not be required to employ any Company Employee for any
specified period of time and shall be able to terminate the employment of any
Company Employee with or without notice, and for any lawful reason or no
reason, subject to the terms of any applicable severance policy or plan of
Purchaser or the employing Affiliate. Nothing in this Section 7.2(a) shall
prohibit Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from changing or cancelling any
benefits that it offers to its employees.

 

(b) Purchaser will treat, and will cause each benefit plan, program, practice,
policy and arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates following the Closing and in which any Company Employee (or the

for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (and,
solely with respect to severance, vacation, sick leave and similar paid time-
off benefits, benefit level and accrual), all service with the Company and its
Affiliates (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company, any Affiliate
of the Company or the corresponding Benefit Plan provides past service credit)
as service with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates. Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each Purchaser Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
(i) to waive any and all eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, pre-existing condition limitations and other exclusions and
limitations with respect to the Company Employees and their spouses, domestic
partners and dependents to the extent waived, satisfied or not included under
the analogous Benefit Plan, and (ii) to recognize for each Company Employee
for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums under such Purchaser Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by the Company Employee and his or her spouse, domestic
partner and dependents under the analogous Benefit Plan during the plan year
of such Benefit Plan in which occurs the later of the Closing Date and the
date on which the Company Employee begins participating in such Purchaser
Plan. 

(c) This Agreement is not intended by the parties to constitute a plan
amendment to or create any obligations of the parties with respect to any
Purchaser Plan or Benefit Plan.

Section 7.3 Forward-Looking Statements. In connection with
Purchasers investigation of the Company and the Business, Purchaser and its
representatives and Affiliates have received from or on behalf of Seller or
the Company or their respective Affiliates certain estimates, budgets,
forecasts, plans and financial projections with respect to the Company and
the Business ("Forward-Looking Statements"), and Purchaser acknowledges that
(a) there are

 



50  uncertainties inherent in making Forward-Looking Statements and (b) it is
familiar with such uncertainties and it is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-Looking
Statements so furnished to it and its representatives (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying Forward-Looking Statements where
such assumptions are explicitly disclosed). Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that any documents that are or were available for its review in connection
with its due diligence investigation will be deemed to have been made
available to, and delivered to and received by, Purchaser for all purposes
if such documents were posted and made available to Purchaser in the Data
Room on the date that is one day prior to the date of this Agreement or were
otherwise delivered to Purchaser or its representatives by electronic mail,
United States mail or overnight courier.

prior to the Outside Date.

(f) Purchaser shall not, nor shall Purchaser permit its Subsidiaries to,

consent, approval or waiver under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, neither
Purchaser, Seller nor any Affiliates shall extend any waiting period under the
HSR Act or Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental

conditioned or delayed). Purchaser, Seller and Affiliates shall also refrain

frustrate any partys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by

legal proceedings against or governmental investigations of Seller, the
Company or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable Seller
or Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement
and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other
party with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant
to this Section 8.3 where such access would violate any Law.

55 ARTICLE X.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.1 General; Survival. From and after the Closing, the Parties will
indemnify each other as provided in this Article X. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Article X will be treated by the Parties for
applicable Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price unless otherwise
required by Law. The representations and warranties of the Parties contained
in this Agreement will survive the Closing (and will not merge into any
instrument of conveyance) until the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing
Date and will expire and thereafter be of no further force and effect; 
_provided_ , _however_ , (x) the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 3.18 (Intellectual Property) shall survive the Closing (and will not
merge into any instrument of conveyance) until the twenty-four month
anniversary of the Closing Date and will expire and thereafter be of no
further force and effect, and (y) the Fundamental Representations will survive
the Closing (and will not merge into any instrument of conveyance) until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and will expire and
thereafter be of no further force and effect. All covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing (and will not merge
into any instrument of conveyance) until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and will thereafter expire and thereafter be of no
further force and effect, and no indemnification obligation will be associated
therewith or based thereon. It is the express intent of the Parties that, if
the applicable survival period for an item as contemplated by this Section
10.1 is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been
applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item will be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in this Section 10.1 for the assertion of claims under
this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among the Parties
and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the
Parties.

 

Section 10.2 Sellers Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the provisions
of this Article X, from and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend,
protect and hold harmless Purchaser and the Company ("Purchaser Indemnitees")
for, from and against any and all Damages incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee
to the extent based upon, attributable to or resulting from:

(a) any breach of any representation and warranty made to Purchaser by the
Company or Seller in Article III or Seller in Article IV or made to Purchaser
by the Company or Seller in any Transaction Document or any certificate
delivered pursuant thereto;

 

(b) any breach by Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Company of any of the
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to be
performed or complied with by Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Company;

(c) any unpaid Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses that are not accounted
for in the calculation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined in
accordance with Article II);

 



56 (d) any claim for indemnification made by any officer or director of the
Company to the extent arising from any event that occurred prior to the
Closing; or

(e) any Excluded Liability.

 

Section 10.3 Limitation on Sellers Indemnification Obligations. Sellers
obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.2 are subject to the
following limitations:

(a) The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
10.2 on any individual claim unless and until the Damages associated with such
claim exceed $25,000, at which point an indemnification claim can be made for
the entire amount of such individual claim, subject to the other terms of
this Article X. Any individual claim that does not have Damages in excess of
$25,000 will not count toward the calculation of the Deductible. The
limitations set forth in this Section 10.3(a) shall not apply to or otherwise
affect the ability of the Purchaser Indemnitees to make claims or recover
Damages with respect to Fundamental Representation Claims.

 

(b) The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
10.2(a) until the total amount of Damages that Purchaser Indemnitees would
recover under Section 10.2(a), but for this Section 10.3(b), exceeds $500,000
(the "Deductible"). Once the total amount of Damages that the Purchaser
Indemnitees would recover under Section 10.2(a), but for this Section
10.3(b), exceeds the Deductible, the Purchaser Indemnitees will be entitled to
recover only the amount of such Damages in excess of the Deductible. The
limitations set forth in this Section 10.3(b) shall not apply to or otherwise
affect the ability to make claims or recover Damages with respect to
Fundamental Representation Claims, _provided_ , _however_ , that Damages
with respect to Fundamental Representations will not be included in
determining whether the Damages that Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under
Section 10.2(a), but for this Section 10.3(b), exceed the Deductible.

 

(c) The Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Damages pursuant
to Section 10.2: (i) in the case of any claim pursuant to Section 10.2(a),
other than a claim for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) regarding a
Fundamental Representation (each, a "Fundamental Representation Claim"), for
any amount of Damages, when aggregated with any amounts previously paid or to
be paid pursuant to this Article X, in excess of $18,000,000, or (ii) in the
case of any Fundamental Representation Claim or any claim pursuant to Section
10.2(b) or 10.2(d), for any amount of Damages, when aggregated with any
amounts previously paid or to be paid pursuant to this Article X, in excess of
$100,000,000.

 

(d) The amount of any recovery by Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section
10.2 will be reduced by the present value of any refund of Taxes paid or
reduction in the amount of Taxes due (except to the extent that Purchaser or
Company has paid such amount to Seller in accordance with Section 11.3),
reflecting an appropriate discount for the timing and receipt or realization
of such refund or reduction resulting from the incurrence of Damages for which
Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to recover from Seller pursuant to Section
10.2, computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient
of such refund of or reduction in Taxes.

 



57 (e) The amount of any recovery by Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section
10.2 will be reduced by the amounts recovered by Purchaser Indemnitees under
any applicable insurance policies or other collateral sources and the amount
of indemnification and other payments recovered by Purchaser
Indemnitees under any applicable indemnification agreements or similar rights
as a result of the facts that entitled the Purchaser Indemnitees to recover
from Seller pursuant to Section 10.2. Each Purchaser Indemnitee agrees to make
all claims and to collect any amounts recoverable under applicable insurance
policies, indemnification agreements and similar rights and to seek recovery
under all applicable insurance policies, indemnification agreements and
similar rights for all Damages to the extent such Damages are covered by any
insurance policy, indemnification agreement or similar right of such Purchaser
Indemnitee. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Purchase Indemnitee with respect to any Damages for which any such Person has
been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery will be made promptly to Seller.

 

(f) In no event will any Purchaser Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
for the same Damages from more than one source.

 

(g) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, NO INDEMNIFIED PARTY WILL
BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE X WITH RESPECT TO, NOR
SHALL THE INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES HEREUNDER INCLUDE OR BE DEEMED TO INCLUDE,
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (REGARDLESS OF THE CHARACTERIZATION THEREOF
OR WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE), DIMINUTION IN VALUE, DAMAGES COMPUTED ON
A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS, BOOK VALUE, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW OR ANY SIMILAR
BASIS, WHETHER OR NOT USED IN ARRIVING AT THE PURCHASE PRICE OR THE POTENTIAL
EARN OUT PAYMENT, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE
AWARDED AS A COMPONENT OF DAMAGES IN A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM.

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser Indemnitees
will not be entitled to recover under Section 10.2: (i) to the extent the
matter in question, taken together with all similar matters, does not exceed
the amount of any reserves or liabilities with respect to such matters that
are reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in the
calculation of the Purchase Price and (ii) with respect to any matter arising
under a provision of this Agreement to the extent that the Purchaser
Indemnitees have already recovered Damages with respect to such matter
pursuant to another provision of this Agreement.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser Indemnitees must first exhaust the Escrow Funds before seeking any
cash payment from Seller as recourse for Damages for which the Purchaser
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X.
Purchaser may, with written notice to Seller, offset against any
available Earn Out Payment as recourse for Damages for which the Purchaser
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X.

 



58 (j) For purposes of calculating Damages hereunder arising out of, relating to
or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
(but not for purposes of determining the existence of any breach (including
any inaccuracy) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement), any
materiality or material adverse effect qualifications in the representations
or warranties shall be ignored.

(k) Notwithstanding the above, the limitations set forth in this Section 10.3
shall not apply with respect to claims or Damages arising from the Companys
or Sellers fraud or intentional misrepresentation in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.

Section 10.4 Purchasers Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the
provisions of this Article X, from and after the Closing, Purchaser will
indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
("Seller Indemnitees") for, from and against any and all Damages incurred by
any Seller Indemnitee to the extent based upon, attributable to or resulting
from:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made to Seller by Purchaser
in Article V or in any Transaction Document;

(b) any breach by Purchaser of any of the covenants or agreements in
this Agreement or any Transaction Document to be performed or complied with
by Purchaser; or

(c) any Assumed Liability.

 

Section 10.5 Limitation on Purchasers Indemnification Obligations.
Purchasers obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.4 are
subject to the following limitations:

(a) Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section
10.4(a) on any individual claim unless and until the Damages associated with
such claim exceed $25,000, at which point an indemnification claim can be made
for the entire amount of such individual claim, subject to the other terms of
this Article X. Any individual claim that does not have Damages in excess of
$25,000 will not count toward the calculation of the Deductible.

 

(b) Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section 10.4(a)
until the total amount of Damages that Seller Indemnitees would recover under
Section 10.4(a), but for this Section 10.5(b), exceeds the Deductible. Once
the total amount of Damages that Seller Indemnitees would recover under
Section 10.4(a), but for this Section 10.5(b), exceeds the Deductible, Seller
Indemnitees will be entitled to recover only the amount of such Damages in
excess of the Deductible.

 

(c) Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Damages pursuant to
Section 10.4(a), in the case of any claim, for any amount of Damages, when
aggregated with any amounts previously paid or to be paid pursuant to this
Article X, in excess of $100,000,000.

 



59 (d) The amount of any recovery by Seller Indemnitees pursuant to Section
10.4 will be reduced by the present value of any refund of Taxes paid or
reduction in the amount of Taxes due, reflecting an appropriate discount for
the timing and receipt or realization of such refund or reduction resulting
from the incurrence of Damages for which Seller Indemnitees are entitled to
recover from Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.4, computed at the highest
marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such refund of or reduction
in Taxes.

 

(e) The amount of any recovery by Seller Indemnitees pursuant to Section 10.4
will be reduced by the amounts recovered by Seller Indemnitees under any
applicable insurance policies recovered by Seller Indemnitees as a result of
the facts that entitled the Seller Indemnitees to recover from Purchaser
pursuant to Section 10.4. Each Seller Indemnitee agrees to make all claims
and to collect any amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies and
to seek recovery under all applicable insurance policies for all Damages to
the extent such Damages are covered by any insurance policy of such
Seller Indemnitee. In the event that an insurance is made by any Seller
Indemnitee with respect to any Damages for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery will be made promptly to Purchaser.

(f) In no event will Seller be entitled to indemnification for the same
Damages from more than one source.

 

(g) For purposes of calculating Damages hereunder arising out of, relating to
or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
(but not for purposes of determining the existence of any breach (including
any inaccuracy) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement), any
materiality or material adverse effect qualifications in the representations
or warranties shall be ignored.

(h) Notwithstanding the above, the limitations set forth in this Section 10.4
shall not apply with respect to claims or Damages arising from Purchasers
fraud or intentional misrepresentation in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

Section 10.6 Expiration of Claims. The ability of any Person to make a claim
for or to receive indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2 or Section 10.4
will terminate when the applicable representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement terminates pursuant to Section 10.1, unless such Person sustained or
incurred Damages prior to the applicable termination date and delivered a
Claim Notice pursuant to Section 10.7 prior to such termination date, in which
case, the claim for such sustained or incurred Damages set forth in such Claim
Notice will survive until a Final Determination has occurred with respect to
such claim.

Section 10.7 Notice and Determination of Claims. If any Indemnified Party
believes that it has incurred any Damages for which it may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder, whether or not the applicable dollar limitation
specified by Article X has been exceeded, such Indemnified Party will
so notify the Indemnifying Party promptly in writing (each, a "Claim
Notice"), specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys
claim for indemnification is asserted and describing such Damages, the
amount thereof, if

 



60  known, or a good faith estimate of the amount, and the method of computation
of such Damages, all with reasonable particularity. After the giving of any
Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of indemnification to which a Person
will be entitled under this Article X will be determined by a Final
Determination or by any other means to which Purchaser and Seller may agree in
writing. The Indemnified Party will have the burden of proof in establishing
the amount of Damages suffered by such Person. A failure by an Indemnified
Party to give timely, complete or accurate notice as provided in this Article
X will not affect the rights or obligations of any Party hereunder except to
the extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party entitled to receive
such notice was damaged or prejudiced as a result of such failure to give
timely notice _vis- a-vis_ its rights and obligations hereunder or otherwise.

Section 10.8 Third-Party Claims.

 

(a) Promptly following the receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim, the Party
receiving the notice of the Third-Party Claim will notify, in writing,
Seller, in the event that such Party receiving notice is a Purchaser
Indemnitee entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2, or Purchaser,
in the event that such Party receiving notice is a Seller Indemnitee entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.4, of its existence setting forth
with reasonable specificity the facts and circumstances of which such Party
has received notice and, if the Party giving such notice is an
Indemnified Party, specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified
Partys claim for indemnification is asserted and describing such Damages, the
amount thereof, if known, or a good faith estimate of the amount, and the
method of computation of such Damages, all with reasonable particularity. The
notice will be accompanied by copies of all documents and information relevant
to the Third-Party Claim and in the Indemnified Partys possession or under
its reasonable control.

 

(b) Subject to Section 10.8(d), the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
conduct and control, at its own expense and through counsel of its choosing,
the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third-Party Claim as to which
indemnification is sought by any Indemnified Party from any Indemnifying Party
hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party in
writing, as promptly as possible after receipt of the notice of Third-Party
Claim given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under Section
10.8(a) of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own
expense, in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof.
The Indemnified Party will cooperate in connection with the defense,
compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to this Section
10.8 and will furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith.

(c) The Indemnifying Party will give the Indemnified Party written notice of
the Indemnifying Partys intention to settle any Third-Party Claim at least
ten days prior to the settlement of any such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party will not settle or compromise such claim or demand without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the Indemnified Party is
given a full and complete release of any and all liability by all relevant
parties to such claim or demand or the damages payable under the settlement
are limited to monetary payments that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party.

 



61 (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.8(b) to the contrary,
the Indemnified Party will have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of (i) any
Third-Party Claim that is a criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation or seeks as the sole remedy an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (ii) any Third-Party
Claim that is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier
or customer of the Company or the Business and the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third-Party
Claim would be materially detrimental to or materially injure the Indemnified
Partys reputation or future business prospects (including the Third-Party
Claim involving any then-existing customer of the Company or Purchaser), or
(iii) the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or
defend such Third-Party Claim. Additionally, the Indemnifying Party will
lose its right to contest, defend, and litigate the Third-Party Claim if it
fails to accept a tender of the defense of the Third-Party Claim. In such
event, the Indemnified Party will have the right to conduct and control,
through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of
any such Third-Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed
or lost its right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no Indemnified
Party will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise, or
discharge, any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(e) If an Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages, then such Indemnifying
Party will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all related
rights and remedies of such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy or
otherwise against or with respect to such Damages, except with respect to
amounts not yet recovered by such Indemnified Party (or such other Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder) under any such insurance policy or
otherwise that already have been netted against such Damages for purposes of
determining the indemnifiable amount of such Damages. Promptly following such
Indemnifying Partys request, such Indemnified Party will take all reasonably
necessary, proper or desirable actions (including the execution and delivery
of any document reasonably requested) to accomplish the foregoing.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.8 to the contrary, any
Third-Party Claim relating to Taxes will be subject to the provisions of
Article XI.

Section 10.9 Indemnification Exclusive Remedy; Specific Performance.

(a) Notwithstanding any other term herein, the sole and exclusive remedies of
the Parties arising out of, relating to or resulting from this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby will be strictly limited to those
contained in this Article X and Section 6.6 and Article XI. In furtherance of
the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each Party hereby
waives and, if necessary to give effect to this Section 10.9, will cause each
Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, to waive, all
claims, causes of action and other remedies of such Person against any Party
(other than claims arising from the

 



62  Companys, Sellers or Purchasers fraud or intentional misrepresentation in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document) as a matter of contract, tort, equity, under or based
upon any applicable Law or otherwise (including for rescission), except to the
extent expressly stated in this Article X. Without limiting the generality of
the preceding sentence, except as provided by this Article X, no claim,
action or remedy will be brought or maintained subsequent to the Closing by
any Purchaser Indemnitee against Seller, and no recourse will be brought or
granted against Seller, sounding in tort or strict liability or by virtue of
or based upon any alleged misstatement or omission respecting an inaccuracy
in, or breach or nonperformance of, any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of Seller set forth in this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 10.9 shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy
on account of the Companys, Sellers or Purchasers fraud or intentional
misrepresentation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

(b) Each of Purchaser, the Company and Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
rights and obligations of each Party set forth in this Agreement, including
each Partys rights to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, are unique and that, if this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms or is otherwise breached, a non-breaching Party will
be damaged irreparably and have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the
Parties agree that any such non-breaching Party will have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in
equity, to enforce such Persons rights and the breaching Partys obligations
under the terms of this Agreement, by bringing an action or actions for
specific performance (including for specific performance of any and all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), injunctive or other equitable
relief (without posting of bond or other security). Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other
remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

Section 10.10 Obligations to Mitigate Damages. Each Indemnified Party will
take, and will cause all other Indemnified Parties to take, all commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all Damages upon and after becoming aware of
any event that gives, or would reasonably be expected to give, rise to
Damages, including diligently pursuing and attempting to recover all
insurance proceeds and all other recoveries under each applicable insurance
policy and diligently pursuing and attempting to obtain all Tax refunds or
reductions in Taxes contemplated under Section 10.3(d).

 

Section 10.11 Release of Escrow. The Escrow Funds will be held by the Escrow
Agent in escrow subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement until the release of the Escrow Funds in accordance with this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable. On the date that is eighteen
months after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly instruct,
if so required by the Escrow Agent as a condition to the release of the Escrow
Funds, the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller the remainder of the Escrow
Funds, if any, that (a) have not been disbursed to Purchaser to compensate
the Purchaser Indemnitees for Damages as provided in this Article X or (b)
have not been retained in escrow to satisfy unresolved claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Article X, if any. Any amount of the Escrow
Funds held in escrow to satisfy any such unresolved claims shall be released
to Seller, Purchaser or the Purchaser Indemnitees, as applicable, upon final
resolution of each such claim.

 



63 ARTICLE XI.

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 11.1 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns . Seller will prepare or
cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns for or with respect to the
Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are filed after the Closing Date,
including any amendments and carryback claims with respect to any such income
Tax Returns. Seller shall include the income of the Company (including any
deferred items taken into account pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19) on the consolidated federal income Tax Returns
of Holdings for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal
income Taxes attributable to such income. For all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company to (a) join in
Sellers consolidated or combined state and federal income Tax Returns and
(b) to file separate company income Tax Returns in state and local
jurisdictions that require Seller to file such returns. All such Tax Returns
shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice,
except as required by a change in applicable law. Seller will permit Purchaser
to review and comment on each such income Tax Return described in the first
sentence of this Section 11.1 prior to filing,  _provided_ that, with respect
to any such Tax Return that is filed on a combined or consolidated basis,
Seller will only be required to provide Purchaser with a copy of the portions
of such Tax Return that directly relate to the Company. After such review,
Seller will submit such income Tax Returns (other than any combined or
consolidated income Tax Return) to the Company for filing. Neither Purchaser
nor Seller will amend or cause to be amended any such income Tax Return in
any way that relates to or affects the Company without the written consent of
the other Party. Purchaser will prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns (other than income Tax Returns) of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Straddle Periods that are due after the Closing Date. Purchaser
will permit Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in
the preceding sentence prior to filing. Purchaser will not amend or cause to
be amended any such Tax Return without the written consent of Seller.

Section 11.2 Tax Benefits . Notwithstanding anything in this Article XI to
the contrary, any Tax Benefits will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
be reflected on the Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or
the pre-closing portion of Straddle Periods, as the case may be. Except as
otherwise required pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of
the Code), neither the Company, Purchaser nor any of their respective
Affiliates will take any position inconsistent with such treatment. To the
extent that any Tax Benefits (including any deductions arising with respect
to any payments of deferred compensation under an agreement entered into in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, and any net operating loss carryforward from a Pre-
Closing Tax Period resulting from the incurrence of Tax Benefits) are
required by applicable Law to be claimed in a period other than a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the pre-closing portion of any Straddle Period, Purchaser will
pay to Seller an amount equal to the product of such Tax Benefits realized
and the highest combined federal and state income Tax rate applicable
thereto, as reasonably determined by Seller. Any payment described in the
preceding sentence will be made within 15 days after the Company, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates actually realizes a reduction in Taxes as
a result of the incurrence of such Tax Benefits.

 



64 Section 11.3 Refunds. Seller will be entitled to any Tax refunds or
overpayments that are received by Purchaser or the Company that arise with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle
Period, except to the extent any such refund or overpayment was taken into
account in determining Working Capital. For purposes of this Section 11.3, in
the event that any actual liability of the Company for Taxes with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period
is less than the amount of such liability for Taxes taken into account in
Working Capital, then such difference will be treated as a refund of such
Taxes. Purchaser will cause the Company to make all filings and take all
actions necessary to secure such refunds or overpayments as promptly
as possible and to pay to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such
overpayment within 15 days after the actual receipt of such refund or
overpayment.

 

Section 11.4 Control of Audit or Tax Litigation. Seller will control any audit
or other Proceeding regarding any Taxes arising in any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or for which Seller is or could be required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to
Article X. Seller will permit Purchaser to review and comment on any documents
in connection with such audit or other Proceeding and will take any
reasonable comments into consideration prior to filing any document. In the
event that Seller settles any such audit in a manner that would adversely
affect the Company after the Closing Date without the prior written consent
of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
any resulting Damages shall be treated as Taxes that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.8. Purchaser and Seller will cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or claim for
refund and any audit or other Proceeding with respect to the Companys Taxes.

 

Section 11.5 Transfer Taxes. Purchaser will assume liability for and pay 50%
and Seller will assume liability for and pay 50% of all sales, use, transfer,
real property transfer, documentary, recording, gains, equity transfer, and
similar Taxes and fees, and any deficiency, interest, or penalty asserted with
respect thereto (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), arising out of or in
connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement.
Purchaser will, at its own expense, timely file or cause to be filed all
necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes,
and, if required by applicable law, Seller will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other
documentation.

 

Section 11.6 Cooperation. Purchaser, the Company and Seller will cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article XI and any
audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will include
the retention and (upon such other Partys request) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit or
other Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 



65 Section 11.7 Carrybacks. Purchaser and the Company shall elect, where
permitted by law, to carry forward any net operating loss or other Tax
attribute of the Company arising in any taxable period that begins on or after
the Closing Date that, absent such election, would be carried back to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. In the event that Company shall not be
able to prevent a Tax attribute from being carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period, Seller shall pay to Purchaser any Tax refund (or
reduction in Tax liability) that results from a carryback into Holdings
consolidated Tax Return of a Tax attribute of the Company that arises in a
taxable period that ends after the Closing Date within 15 days of when such
refund (or reduction) is realized by Holdings or its Subsidiaries. At the
request of Purchaser, Seller will cooperate with the Company in obtaining such
refund (or reduction), including the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund
claims. Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller for any Taxes resulting from
the disallowance of such Tax attribute on audit or otherwise.

Section 11.8 Tax Indemnification. Seller shall indemnify the Company and
Purchaser and hold them harmless from and against any loss, claim, liability,
expense or other damage attributable to (a) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Company for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the Pre-Closing Period for any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (to the extent the liability for such
Taxes has not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or taken into account in
determining final Working Capital), (b) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company is or
was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or
non-U.S. law or regulation, and (c) any and all Taxes of any person (other
than the Company) imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to
an event or transaction occurring before the Closing. Sellers obligations
pursuant to this Section 11.8 shall be subject to applicable limitations under
Section 10.3, determined as if the liability for Taxes arose with respect to
a Fundamental Representation Claim.

Section 11.9 Tax-Sharing Agreements. All Tax Sharing Agreements with respect
to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and,
after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

 

Section 11.10 Section 338(h)(10) Election. Holdings and Purchaser shall join
in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under state, local, or non-U.S. tax law) (collectively
a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the purchase and sale of the
stock of the Company hereunder. Seller will pay any Tax attributable to the
making of the 338(h)(10) Election and will indemnify Purchaser and the Company
against any adverse consequences arising out of any failure to pay such Tax.

 

Section 11.11 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Parties agree that the
Purchase Price, the Earn Out Payment and the liabilities of the Company
accrued as of the Closing Date (plus other relevant items) will be allocated
among the assets of the Company for all Tax purposes in a manner to be
separately agreed in writing within three months following the Closing Date.
In the event the Parties are unable to agree on such allocation, any dispute
shall be handled in accordance with procedures similar to those set forth in
Section 2.6. Purchaser, the Company, and Seller shall file all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in
a manner consistent with such allocation, and will not take any position that
is inconsistent with such allocation in any audit or other Proceeding.

 



66  Purchaser shall prepare Form 8883, Asset Allocation Statement under Section
338 consistently with the foregoing allocation and provide such document to
Seller for its review and comment within three months of the Closing Date.
Any amendments or modifications to Form 8883 required to take into account
Earn Out Payments or any other adjustments to Purchase Price after the Closing
Date shall be prepared by Purchaser consistently with the foregoing
allocation and provided to Seller for its review and comment within 60 days of
the end of any calendar year in which such Earn Out payment or any other
amendment or modification to Form 8883 is required to be attached to a Tax
Return for that tax year.

ARTICLE XII.

(b) by either Purchaser or Seller if the Closing has not occurred at or before
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on October 14, 2015 (the "Outside Date"); _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
12.2(b) will not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any of
its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 

(c) by Purchaser in the event of any material breach by the Company or Seller
of any of the Companys or Sellers agreements, covenants, representations or
warranties contained herein and the failure of the Company or Seller to cure
such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice from Purchaser requesting
such breach to be cured;

 

(d) by Seller in the event of any material breach by Purchaser of any of
Purchasers agreements, representations or warranties contained herein and
the failure of Purchaser to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of

as limiting or denying any legal or equitable right or remedy of the non-
breaching Parties. If, following the termination of this Agreement, any
litigation or other Proceeding is commenced by any Party to pursue any legal
or equitable right or remedy against any other Party whose willful breach of a
material representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein results in the
termination of this Agreement, all fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing Party
in such litigation or other Proceeding will be reimbursed by the losing Party;
_provided_ that, if a Party to such litigation or other Proceeding prevails in

such documents were furnished promptly to return or destroy such documents
and any copies thereof any of them may have made; and

accordance with Section 7.1 and survive termination of this Agreement.

related to this Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are
expressly named as parties to or third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
Except to the extent named as a party to or third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such
Parties set forth in this Agreement, no past, present or future equityholder,
director, manager, officer, employee, agent, representative or Affiliate of
any Party will have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or other obligations or liabilities of any of the Parties or for any claim
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, no claim may be brought or maintained by Purchaser or any other
Purchaser Indemnitee or any of their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any present or future equityholder, director,
manager, officer, employee, agent, representative or Affiliate of any Party
which is not otherwise expressly identified as a party to this Agreement, and
no recourse will be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach or
nonperformance of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of any Party set forth or contained in this Agreement or any
exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder. As a
material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, effective as of

(collectively, the "Releasees"), with respect to and from any and all Damages
(including employment contracts) or Proceedings, of whatever kind or nature
in Law, equity or otherwise, whether now known or unknown, and whether or not
concealed or hidden, all of which Holdings, Seller or any of Sellers
Subsidiaries now owns or holds or has at any time owned or held against
Releasees; _provided_ , _that_ nothing in this Section 13.2 will be deemed to
constitute a release by Holdings, Seller or any of Sellers Subsidiaries
of any right to enforce its rights under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

 



69 Section 13.3 Disclosure Schedule. All representations and warranties of the
Company and Seller in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document are
made subject to and modified by the exceptions noted in the schedules
delivered by the Company and Seller to Purchaser concurrently herewith and
identified as the "Disclosure Schedule," as it may be modified from time to
time pursuant to Section 6.5. A disclosure made by the Company or Seller in
any Section of the Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof) that informs
Purchaser of information with respect to another Section of this Agreement or
the Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof) or any other Transaction
Document in order to avoid a breach thereof or misrepresentation thereunder
will be deemed, for all purposes of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, to have been made with respect to all such other Sections of this
Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof) or other
Transaction Document, notwithstanding any cross-references (which are
included solely as a matter of convenience) or lack of a Schedule reference
in any representation or warranty. Information reflected in the Disclosure
Schedule is not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional information is set
forth for informational purposes and does not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. Disclosure of such additional information will
not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is
required to be disclosed, and disclosure of such information will not be
deemed to enlarge or enhance any of the representations or warranties in this
Agreement or otherwise alter in any way the terms of this Agreement. Inclusion
of information in the Disclosure Schedule will not be construed as an
admission that such information is material to the Shares, the business or the
assets, liabilities, financial position, operations or results of operations
of the Company or Seller with respect to the Business.

Section 14.4 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Exclusivity Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among or between any of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. Each exhibit and schedule to this Agreement will be
considered incorporated into this Agreement. Any amendments, or alternative or
supplementary provisions, to this Agreement must be made in writing and,
except for any updates to the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section 6.5,
duly executed by Purchaser and Seller.

 

Section 14.5 Non-Waiver. The failure in any one or more instances of a Party
to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement
conferred, or the waiver by such Party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement, will not be construed as
a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or

legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. At the request of any Party or to any such contract, each other Party

other Parties. No Party or to any such contract will raise the use of
facsimile, electronic transmission in PDF format or similar format to deliver
a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile, electronic transmission in PDF
format or similar format as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
such Party forever waives any such defense.

 



72 Section 14.8 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or any other jurisdiction, and, for purposes of such
jurisdiction, such provision or portion thereof will be struck from the

benefit of the Parties and those Persons (or categories of Persons)

Section 14.15 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and will not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 14.16 Legal Representation. Each of the Parties acknowledges
that Perkins Coie LLP ("Perkins") currently serves as counsel to each of the
Company and Seller, including in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. There may come a time, including after
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, when the
interests of Seller and the Company may no longer be aligned or when, for any
reason, Perkins, Seller, or the Company believes that Perkins can or should no
longer represent each of Seller and the Company. The Parties understand and
specifically agree that Perkins may withdraw from representing the Company
and continue to represent Seller even if the interests of Seller and the
interests of the Company are or may be adverse, including in connection with
any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and even though Perkins may have represented
the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be
handling ongoing matters for the Company or any of its Affiliates. Each of
Purchaser and the Company hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of
interest arising solely from (i) any dispute arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
indemnification by Seller that may arise between Seller and Purchaser, the
Company or any Purchaser Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Each of the Parties further agrees that, as to all communications among
Perkins, Seller, or the Company, the attorney-client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege belong to Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Company
or any of its Affiliates. In addition, if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, then the Company shall have no right of access
to or control over any of Perkins records related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which shall become the property of (and be
controlled by) Seller. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between Seller
and the Company arising out of or relating to any matter in which Perkins
acted for them both, none of the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence or any other rights to any evidentiary privilege will
protect from disclosure to Seller any information or documents developed or
shared during the course of Perkins joint representation of Seller and the
Company.

 



74 Section 14.17 Guaranty.

 

(a) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, the
Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as
principal and not as surety, to Purchaser and its successors, the due and
punctual payment of all monetary obligations payable by Seller to Purchaser
under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents (the guaranty obligations
under this Section 14.17, collectively, the "Guarantied Obligations");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Guarantors liability to
Purchaser and its successors with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or otherwise exceed an amount in
excess of $100,000,000 (the "Guaranty Cap"). The obligations of Guarantor
under this Section 14.17 with respect to any obligation of Seller hereunder
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the expiration or
termination of the applicable obligation of Seller hereunder. Purchaser
acknowledges that neither Purchaser nor any of Purchasers successors shall
have any right to recover any amount in excess of the Guaranty Cap from the
Guarantor hereunder as the result of, in connection with or arising from the
Guarantied Obligations and hereby waives any right that it may have in law or
in equity to recover amounts from the Guarantor in excess of the Guaranty Cap
with respect to the Guarantied Obligations, except for any amounts in excess
of the Guaranty Cap that arise from Sellers or, prior to the Closing, the
Companys fraud or intentional misrepresentation in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

(b) The Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be duly and
punctually paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to
the Guaranty Cap. If for any reason Seller shall fail or be unable duly and
punctually to pay any Guarantied Obligation as and when the same shall become
due, then the Guarantor shall, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, forthwith duly and punctually pay such Guarantied Obligation,
subject to the Guaranty Cap.

(c) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (i) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this
Agreement, (ii) any presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice of non-
payment as the same pertains to Seller or the Company, suit or the taking of
other action by Purchaser against, and any other notice to, Seller or the
Company, the Guarantor or others with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations, (iii) any right to require Purchaser to proceed against either
Seller or the Company or to exhaust any security held by Purchaser or to
pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations,
(iv) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Purchaser, unless the
same would excuse performance by the Company and Seller under this Agreement
with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, and (v) any duty of
Purchaser to advise the Guarantor of any information known to Purchaser
regarding Seller or the Company or their respective ability to perform under
this Agreement with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations. Purchaser
may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the
Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (A) agree with
Seller to make any change in the terms of the Guarantied Obligations, (B) take
or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for the
Guarantied Obligations, (C) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against Seller or others, or (D) compromise or subordinate the Guarantied
Obligations, including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses
are hereby waived by the Guarantor with respect to any of the
Guarantied Obligations.

 



75 (d) The provisions of this Section 14.17 shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if (i) at any time and to the extent that
any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of Seller or the Guarantor, all as though
such payment had not been made or (ii) the obligations of the Guarantor under
this Section 14.17, with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, are
released in consideration of a payment of money or transfer of property by
Seller or any other Person and to the extent that such payment, transfer or
grant is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the recipient thereof upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of Seller or the
Guarantor, all as though such payment, transfer or grant had not been made.

FORM OF

ESCROW AGREEMENT

This Escrow Agreement, dated as of [ ], 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), is entered into by and among: (i) Autoliv ASP Inc., an Indiana corporation
(" _Purchaser_ "); (ii) M/A-COM Technology Solutions Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Seller_ ," and, together with Purchaser, the " _Parties_ ,"
and, each individually, a " _Party_ "); and (iii) Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, a national banking association, as escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ").

A. This Agreement is entered into and delivered by the parties hereto in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that
certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2015 (the " _Purchase
Agreement_ "), by and among the Parties and each other Person party thereto.
Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the respective meanings
ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement.

B. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser will deliver
certain funds to the Escrow Agent on the date of this Agreement, which funds
will be held in escrow as a reserve to satisfy Damages, subject to the
Deductible and any applicable indemnification cap set forth in the
Purchase Agreement incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees, if any, for which
indemnity is available pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

 

C. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Escrow Agent is not a party
to, is not bound by, and has no duties or obligations under, the Purchase
Agreement, (ii) all references in this Agreement to the Purchase Agreement are
for convenience, and (iii) the Escrow Agent will have no implied duties beyond
the express duties set forth in this Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties and the Escrow
Agent set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the
Escrow Agent, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

ESCROW DEPOSIT

Section 1.1  _Establishment of Escrow; Appointment of Escrow Agent_.

(a) On the date of this Agreement, or as agreed to by the Parties,
pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser will
deliver to the Escrow Agent cash in the amount of $18,000,000 (the " _Escrow
Property_ "). The Escrow Agent hereby accepts and agrees to hold the Escrow
Property and all dividends, interest and earnings thereon in a separate and
distinct account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") on behalf of the Parties pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties appoint the Escrow Agent as their agent solely for the
purposes of holding, investing, administering, safeguarding and disbursing
the Escrow Property pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent, by executing this Agreement, acknowledges it will receive the Escrow
Property and deposit the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account, accepts
the appointment as the Escrow Agent and agrees to receive, hold, invest,
administer, safeguard and disburse all of the Escrow Property, in each case,
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Section 1.2 _Investments; Monthly Statements_.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent will establish and maintain the Escrow Account for the
Escrow Property and is authorized and directed to deposit, transfer and hold
the Escrow Property and any investment income thereon as set forth in _Exhibit
A_ hereto, or as set forth in any subsequent Joint Written Instruction (as
defined below) signed by both of the Parties. Any investment earnings and
income (including interest earned) on the Escrow Property will become part of
the Escrow Property and will be disbursed in accordance with _Section 1.3_,
_Section 1.5_ or _Section 1.6_ of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent will have no responsibility or
liability for any loss which may result from any investment or sale of
investment made in accordance with and pursuant to this Agreement, other than
to the extent resulting from its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.
The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any
investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its Affiliates, whether it or any such
Affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or
dealing as principal for its own account. The Parties acknowledge that the
Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations or
advice.

(c) The Escrow Agent will keep an accurate record of all transactions with
respect to the Escrow Property and will send statements to Purchaser and
Seller on a monthly basis, or more frequently at the request of any Party,
reflecting activity in the Escrow Account.

 

Section 1.3 _Release of Escrow Property_.

 

(a) _Joint Written Instructions_. The Escrow Agent will release the Escrow
Property in accordance with written instructions signed by both of the
Parties (each, a " _Joint Written Instruction_ ") within five business days of
the receipt of such Joint Written Instruction by the Parties to the Escrow
Agent. The Parties each agree to issue Joint Written Instructions from
time to time when either Party is entitled to payment in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement.

(b)  _Court Order_. The Escrow Agent will release the Escrow Property in
accordance with (i) a final, non-appealable award, judgment or order issued by
a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) a final, binding and non-appealable
ruling by an arbitrator or other Person with such authority. Any judgment,
order, ruling or award delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section
1.3(b)_ will be accompanied by an opinion of counsel or certification by an
authorized officer of such Person indicating that the order, award, ruling or
judgment issued by the court or arbitrator is a Final Determination.

(c)  _Time Release_. On the third Business Day following the 18 month
anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "), the Escrow
Agent will, automatically and without the requirement to deliver a Joint
Written Instruction or otherwise, disburse the Disbursement Amount (as
defined below) from the Escrow Property, with accrued interest thereon, to
Seller. The term (i) " _Disbursement Amount_ " means the difference, only if
positive, between (A) the remaining balance of the Escrow Property as of the
Escrow Release Date (taking into account any unpaid amount then payable
pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ or _Section 1.3(b)_), and (B) the then
aggregate unresolved claim amounts set forth in all Claim Notices delivered
by the Purchaser Indemnitees to Seller (with a copy to the Escrow Agent)
pursuant to Article X of the Purchase Agreement, if any, timely and properly
delivered to Seller on or before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Escrow
Release Date. After giving effect to the release of the Escrow Property or a
portion thereof pursuant to this _Section 1.3(c)_, after the Escrow Release
Date, the balance of the Escrow Property, if any, will be released by the
Escrow Agent only in accordance with _Section 1.3(a)_ or _Section 1.3(b)_,
and in each case, within five days after the final resolution of any such
unresolved claim.

 



2 Section 1.4 _Security Procedure For Funds Transfers_. The Escrow Agent will
confirm each funds transfer instruction received in the name of a Party by
means of the security procedure selected by such Party and communicated to the
Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ or
_Exhibit B-2_  attached hereto, which, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent, will
become a part of this Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent, _Exhibit
B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ may be revised or rescinded only by a writing signed by
an authorized representative of the applicable Party. Such revisions or
rescissions will be effective only after actual receipt and following such
period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable
opportunity to act on it. If a revised  _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ or a
rescission of an existing _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ is delivered to the
Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to such Party, then
such document will be accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to
the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and
responsibilities of the Party under this Agreement.

 

The Parties understand that the Escrow Agents inability to receive or confirm
funds transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure selected
by such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer and
agree that the Escrow Agent will not be liable for any loss caused by any such
delay.

 

Section 1.5 _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest and other
income from investment of the Escrow Property will, as of the end of each
calendar year be reported as having been earned by Seller, and any taxes and
related charges imposed with respect to that income will be borne by Seller,
whether or not such income was disbursed during such calendar year.

 

(b) Prior to the date hereof, the Parties will provide the Escrow Agent with
certified tax identification numbers by furnishing appropriate forms W-9 or
W-8 and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may reasonably
request. The Parties understand that if such tax reporting documentation is
not provided and certified to the Escrow Agent, then the Escrow Agent may
be required by the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder to
withhold a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of
the Escrow Property.

 

(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow
Property, the Escrow Agent will satisfy such liability to the extent possible
from the Escrow Property. The Parties, jointly and severally, will indemnify,
defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late
payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed
against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Property and the
investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
expense was primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Escrow Agent. The indemnification provided by this _Section 1.5(c)_ is in
addition to the indemnification provided in _Section 3.1_ and will survive
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this
Agreement.

(d) Seller will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Property for federal
and state income tax purposes but, unless and until such time as
distributions are made from the Escrow Property to Seller, on the one hand, or
Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to this Agreement, will not be treated
as the owner of the Escrow Property for any other purpose.

 



3 Section 1.6 _Termination_. Upon the disbursement of all of the Escrow Property
in accordance with the terms hereof, including any interest and investment
earnings thereon, this Agreement will terminate and be of no further force and
effect, except that the provisions of _Section 1.5(c)_, _Section 3.1_ and 
_Section 3.2_ hereof will survive termination.

ARTICLE 2

 

DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT

 

Section 2.1 _Scope of Responsibility_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, the Escrow Agent is obligated only to perform the duties
specifically set forth in this Agreement, which will be deemed purely
ministerial in nature. Under no circumstance will the Escrow Agent be deemed
to be a fiduciary to any Party or any other Person under this Agreement. The
Escrow Agent will not be responsible or liable for the failure of any Party
to perform in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent will neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the
terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document other
than this Agreement, any Claim Notice, any Joint Written Notice and any Joint
Written Instructions delivered pursuant hereto, whether or not an original or
a copy of such agreement has been provided to the Escrow Agent; and the
Escrow Agent will have no duty to know or inquire as to the performance or
nonperformance of any provision of any such agreement, instrument or document.
References in this Agreement to any other agreement, instrument or document
are for the convenience of the Parties, and the Escrow Agent has no duties or
obligations with respect thereto. The Escrow Agent further agrees that all
property held by the Escrow Agent under this Agreement will be segregated from
all other property held by the Escrow Agent and will be identified as being
held in connection with this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by
appropriate identification on the books and records of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent agrees that its documents and records with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be available for examination
by authorized representatives of Seller and Purchaser. This Agreement sets
forth all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent will be inferred or implied from
the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Attorneys and Agents_. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely
on and will not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Escrow Agent in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel or other
professionals retained or consulted by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will
be reimbursed as set forth in _Section 3.1_ for any and all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket compensation (including reasonable and documented
fees and expenses) paid or reimbursed to such counsel or professionals. The
Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties through its
agents, representatives, attorneys, custodians or nominees.

Section 2.3 _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent will not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
direction or consent of the Parties or their respective agents,
representatives, successors or assigns. The Escrow Agent will not be liable
for acting or refraining from acting upon any notice, request, consent,
direction, requisition, certificate, order, affidavit, letter or other
document reasonably believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and
to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, without further
inquiry into the persons or persons authority. Concurrent with the execution
of this Agreement, the Parties will deliver to the Escrow Agent _Exhibit B-1_
and _Exhibit B-2_ , which contain authorized signer designations in Part I
thereof.

Section 2.4 _Right Not Duty Undertaken_. The permissive rights of the Escrow
Agent to do things enumerated in this Agreement will not be construed as
duties.

 



4 Section 2.5 _No Financial Obligation_. No provision of this Agreement will
require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability or potential financial liability in the performance of
its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 3

PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT

Section 3.1 _Indemnification_. Seller and Purchaser, will severally and
jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, costs, damages and expenses,
including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses
or other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket professional fees and
expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by reason of any action,
claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent, arising out of or
relating in any way to this Agreement or any transaction to which
this Agreement relates, except to the extent such loss, liability, cost,
damage or expense will have been finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the Escrow Agents willful misconduct or gross negligence;
_provided_ , _however_ , as between the Parties, Seller and Purchaser will
each be responsible for fifty percent of any such loss, liability, cost,
damage or expense. To the extent any such loss, liability, cost, damage or
expense is caused by Seller, then Seller will reimburse Purchaser for any and
all such loss, liability, cost, damage or expense incurred by Purchaser. To
the extent any such loss, liability, cost, damage or expense is caused by
Purchaser, then Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any
and all such loss, liability, cost, damage or expense. The provisions of this
_Section 3.1_ will survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and
the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2 _Limitation of Liability_. THE ESCROW AGENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (a) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT
OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE ESCROW
AGENTS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (b) SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING
LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION. 

Section 3.3 _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign by
furnishing written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties
may remove the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent written notice
signed by both of the Parties (a " _Joint Written Notice_ ") of its removal
along with payment of all fees and expenses to which the Escrow Agent is
entitled through the date of removal. Such resignation or removal, as the case
may be, will be effective thirty days after the delivery of such notice or
upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agents
sole responsibility thereafter will be to safely keep the Escrow Property and
to deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as will be appointed by the
Parties, as evidenced by a Joint Written Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent
or in accordance with a court order. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty days following the
delivery of such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting
appointment will be binding upon the Parties; _provided_ _that_ , any such
successor will be a commercial bank, trust company or other financial
institution with its principal place of business located in the United States
and having a combined capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000 unless
otherwise agreed to by Seller and Purchaser in a Joint Written Notice; and 
_provided_ _further_ that, such successor must have executed and delivered an
escrow agreement in substantially the form of this Agreement.

 



5 Section 3.4 _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to compensation
for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
, which compensation will be paid one-half by each of Purchaser and Seller.
The fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full
compensation for the Escrow Agents services as contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that (a) the conditions
for the disbursement of funds under this Agreement are not fulfilled, (b) the
Escrow Agent renders any necessary service not contemplated in this
Agreement, (c) there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of
this Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or (d) any material
controversy arises hereunder or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any
litigation pertaining to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then, in
each case, the Escrow Agent will be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all reasonable and documented costs
and expenses, including reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys fees and
expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation or event;
which compensation and/or reimbursement will be paid one-half by each of
Purchaser and Seller. If any amount due to the Escrow Agent hereunder is not
paid within thirty days of the date due, the Escrow Agent will notify the
Parties and if such amount is not paid within fifteen Business Days of such
notice, the Escrow Agent may deduct any unpaid fees and expenses due to
Escrow Agent from the Escrow Property. In the event that the Escrow Agent has
offset such fees and expenses from the Escrow Property, the Party or Parties
failing to pay the same directly to the Escrow Agent will promptly reimburse
the Escrow Property for the same. The Escrow Agent will have, and is hereby
granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Property with respect to its unpaid
fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights,
superior to the interests of any other persons or entities and is hereby
granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed
expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow Property.

 

Section 3.5 _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning
or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to be
taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, after sending written
notice of the same to Purchaser and Seller, retain the Escrow Property until
the Escrow Agent (a) receives a final non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or a final non-appealable arbitration decision
directing delivery of the Escrow Property, in which event the Escrow Agent
will be authorized to disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with such
final court order or arbitration decision, (b) receives a written agreement
executed by each of the parties involved in such disagreement or dispute
directing delivery of the Escrow Property, in which event the Escrow Agent
will be authorized to disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with such
agreement, or (c) files an interpleader action in any court of competent
jurisdiction, and upon the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent will be relieved
of all liability as to the Escrow Property and will be entitled to recover
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees, expenses and other
costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such interpleader action. The
Escrow Agent will be entitled to act on any such agreement, court order, or
arbitration decision without further question, inquiry, or consent.

 

Section 3.6 _Merger or Consolidation_. Any corporation or association into
which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such
conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent
is a party, will be and become the successor escrow agent under this Agreement
and will have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and
privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any
instrument or paper or the performance of any further act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such successor will be a commercial bank, trust company
or other financial institution with its principal place of business located
in the United States having a combined capital and surplus in excess of
$100,000,000 unless otherwise agreed to by Seller and Purchaser in a Joint
Written Notice.

 



6 Section 3.7 _Attachment of Escrow Property; Compliance with Legal Orders_. In
the event that any Escrow Property will be attached, garnished or levied upon
by any court order, or the delivery thereof will be stayed or enjoined by an
order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree will be made or entered by
any court order affecting the Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems
appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or
issued, or which it is reasonably advised by legal counsel of its own
choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. In the
event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or
decree it will not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person,
firm or corporation, should, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding,
such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated.

 

Section 3.8 _Force Majeure_. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible or
liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God,
earthquakes, fire, flood, wars, acts of terrorism, civil or military
disturbances, sabotage, epidemic, riots, interruptions, loss or malfunctions
of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications services,
accidents, labor disputes, acts of civil or military authority or governmental
action; it being understood that the Escrow Agent will use commercially
reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the
circumstances.

policy, then all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any

parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible. If the parties (after negotiation in good faith) are unable to so

be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to

all references to Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits will mean and

executed by the Parties and the Escrow Agent.

Section 4.9  _Waivers_. The failure of any party to this Agreement at any

will in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same
performance. A waiver by any party to this Agreement of any such condition or
breach of any term, covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this
Agreement, in any one or more instances, will neither be construed as a
further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach nor a waiver of
any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation, or
warranty contained in this Agreement.

this Agreement will be resolved against any party. Any controversy over
construction of this Agreement will be decided without regard to events of
authorship or negotiation.

Section 4.13 _Nature of Interest in Escrow Property; Improper Withdrawal of
Funds_. It is the intent of Seller and Purchaser that (a) Sellers interest
in the Escrow Property and (b) Purchasers interest in the Escrow Property is,
in each case, merely a contingent right to payment, and that neither a
voluntary nor involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar law nor the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or similar
official in respect of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be (each, a "
_Bankruptcy Event_ "), will increase either Sellers or Purchasers
respective interest in the Escrow Property or affect, modify, convert or
otherwise change the contingent nature of its respective right to payment of
the Escrow Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Escrow
Agent distributes or otherwise releases any Escrow Property to a Party or any
of its successors or assigns (including, upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy
Event) in breach of the terms of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement,
then such Party covenants and agrees (i) to hold any such funds in trust for
the exclusive benefit of the other Party in an account separate and apart from
such Partys other assets, (ii) not to comingle such funds with such Partys
other assets, and (iii) to promptly (and in no event later than one Business
Day) return such funds to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow
Account.

 

Section 4.14 _Publication; Disclosure_. By executing this Agreement, the
Parties and the Escrow Agent acknowledge that this Agreement (including
related attachments) contains certain information that is sensitive and
confidential in nature and agree that such information needs to be protected
from improper disclosure, including the publication or dissemination of
this Agreement and related information to individuals or entities not a party
to this Agreement. The Parties further agree to take reasonable measures to
mitigate any risks associated with the publication or disclosure of this
Agreement and information contained therein. If a Party is aware on the date
hereof that it must disclose or publish this

 



10  Agreement or information contained therein pursuant to any regulatory,
statutory, or governmental requirement, as well as any judicial, or
administrative order, subpoena or discovery request, it will, to the extent
permitted by law, notify in writing the other Party and the Escrow Agent prior
to the time of execution of this Agreement of the legal requirement to do so.
If, after the date of execution of this Agreement, a Party becomes subject to
an obligation to disclose or publish this Agreement or information contained
herein pursuant to any regulatory, statutory, or governmental requirement, as
well as any judicial or administrative order, subpoena or discovery request,
it will, to the extent permitted by law, notify in writing the other Party
and the Escrow Agent of the legal requirement to do so. If any Party becomes
aware of any threatened or actual unauthorized disclosure, publication or use
of this Agreement, that Party will promptly notify in writing the other
Parties and the Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties will
be permitted to disclose any information to their respective employees,
advisors and consultants on a need-to-know basis.

Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

services provided by third parties (each, a " _Third Party Provider_ ") in
connection therewith (each, a " _Service_ " and, collectively, the "
_Services_ "), for the respective periods, and on the respective terms and
conditions, set forth herein and in the Service Attachment. Notwithstanding
the contents of the Service Attachment, M/A-COM agrees to reasonably consider
any reasonable request by Autoliv for access to any additional services that

Attachment, and potentially to quote the provision of such additional services
for an additional fee to be discussed between the parties at the applicable

respect thereto. The names of the Service Coordinators for Autoliv and M/A-COM
as of the Effective Date are set forth in the Service Attachment. Each of

basis to M/A-COM all information and materials reasonably requested by M/A-COM
to the extent necessary for M/A-COM to provide the Services hereunder. Autoliv
will give, and will cause Auto Solutions to give, M/A-COM and its
representatives reasonable access, during regular business hours and at such
other times as are reasonably required, to Auto Solutions premises to the
extent necessary for M/A-COM to provide the Services hereunder; _provided_
that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
Autoliv or Auto Solutions. M/A-COM will keep reasonable books and records of
the Services provided hereunder and reasonable supporting documentation of
all charges and fees incurred in connection with providing the Services.
M/A-COM will make such books and records available to Autoliv and Auto
Solutions and its representatives during regular business hours upon
reasonable advance written notice; _provided_ that such access will be
provided only to the extent (a) it does not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of M/A-COM and (b) it is reasonably necessary to confirm
calculations and expenses.

 

1.5 _Cooperation_. Each of the parties hereto will reasonably cooperate in
good faith with the other in connection with the Services to be provided
under this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto will take such actions, upon
the written request of the other party hereto and in addition to the actions
required to perform the Services hereunder or as otherwise specified in
this Agreement, as may be necessary or reasonably required to implement or
give effect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ that in
no event will either party hereto be required to license, acquire or transfer
any property or assets in connection with such actions or incur any out-of-
pocket expenses in connection with such actions, unless in the case of
expenses the requesting party reimburses such party for such expenses.

 



2 ARTICLE II

 

 _TERM_

2.1 _Term_. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with _Article VI_ ,
modified or extended in writing jointly by Autoliv and M/A-COM, the term of
this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will expire on December
31, 2015 (the " _Term_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without
limiting _Section 6.1_, the parties hereto may agree in the Service
Attachment to a different period of time for the performance of any particular
Service, in which case the Term for such Service will be for such time as is
stated in the Service Attachment or the applicable amendment thereto.

ARTICLE III 

_COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES; PAYMENT TERMS_

 

3.1 _Compensation for Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the total compensation payable by Autoliv to M/A-COM for the
Services provided pursuant to the Service Attachment (the " _Services Costs_
") will consist of an aggregate amount equal to: (a) a fixed monthly fee of
$20,000 per calendar month (pro-rated for any partial calendar month during
the Term) for Services provided pursuant to the Service Attachment other than
for use of the Licensed Premises (as defined in Schedule #3 of the Service
Attachment); (b) a fixed monthly fee of $23,500 per calendar month for use
of the Licensed Premises (pro-rated for any partial calendar month for which
Autoliv uses the Licensed Premises); (c) such additional costs, fees and
charges as may be set forth in the Service Attachment; and (d) any reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and charges paid by M/A-COM to Third
Party Providers in connection with performing the Services.

3.2 _Payment Terms_. As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar
month, M/A-COM will submit to Autoliv an invoice setting forth in reasonable
detail, with such supporting documentation as Autoliv may reasonably request,
the Services Costs in such preceding calendar month (each, an " _Invoice_ ").
Autoliv will pay the aggregate amount set forth in each Invoice to M/A-COM
within five Business Days of its receipt of such Invoice. If such payment is
not received by M/A-COM within such five-Business Day period, then Autoliv
will also pay M/A-COM interest from and after the first day following such
five-Business Day period in respect of such Invoice through, but excluding,
the date of payment by Autoliv, at a rate per annum equal to three percent.

3.3 _Disputed Invoices_. If Autoliv reasonably disputes its obligation to pay
the full amount of an Invoice, Autoliv shall so notify M/A-COM in writing,
which notice shall specify the amount of the Invoice that is disputed and the
reasonably detailed basis for Autolivs belief that it is not obligated to pay
such amount as provided in such Invoice. Each partys Service Coordinator
shall then promptly confer with the goal of resolving such dispute. If, within
five Business Days after Autolivs notice of dispute, the Service Coordinators
fail to resolve such dispute, a senior executive representative of Autoliv
and M/A-COM shall promptly meet and make all good faith efforts to resolve
such dispute, and either party may commence any formal proceedings
notwithstanding the occurrence or nonoccurrence of such senior executive
meeting. 

 



3 ARTICLE IV

 

 _RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS_

 

4.1 _Controlling Provisions_. If there is any conflict or inconsistency
between the terms and conditions set forth in the main body of this Agreement
and the Service Attachment, then the provisions of the Service Attachment will
control with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties hereto
regarding the Services (including any additional or modified Services). If
there is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
then the provisions of this Agreement will control solely with respect to the
rights and obligations of the parties hereto regarding the Services.

ARTICLE V __

 

 _FORCE MAJEURE; INDEMNIFICATION_

 

5.1 _Force Majeure_. Except for payment of amounts due, neither party hereto
will be held liable for any delay or failure in performance of any part of
this Agreement, including the Service Attachment, from any cause not primarily
attributable to its gross negligence or willful misconduct or beyond its
reasonable control, including acts of God, acts of civil or military
authority, embargoes, epidemics, war, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections,
fires, explosions, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, or
disruptions in Internet and other telecommunication networks and backbones,
power and other utilities. Upon the occurrence of a condition described in
this _Article V_ , the party hereto whose performance is prevented will
provide written notice to the other party hereto, and the parties hereto will
promptly confer, in good faith, on what action may be taken to minimize the
impact on both parties of such condition and will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize the delay or failure resulting from such
condition.

 

5.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) Subject to the other limitations set forth in _Section 5.3_, each party
hereto (in such capacity, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") will indemnify,
reimburse and hold harmless the other party hereto and its Affiliates
and equityholders and their respective successors, assigns, officers,
directors, managers, employees, consultants, advisors, agents and
representatives (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind, interest
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively,
" _Losses_ ") asserted against, imposed upon, suffered by or incurred by any
of the Indemnified Persons as a result of, with respect to, or arising from
any breach or default caused by the Indemnifying Partys gross negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
(including the performance of the Services); _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable to the extent that Losses result from or arise out of
any Indemnified Persons bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



4 (b) Without limitation or duplication of clause (a), Autoliv will indemnify,
reimburse and hold harmless M/A-COM and its Indemnified Persons from and
against any Losses asserted against, imposed upon, suffered by or incurred by
M/A-COM or any of its Indemnified Persons (i) as a result of any damage to or
corruption of any electronic information, data or information technology
infrastructure that M/A-COM can reasonably demonstrate was caused by Autolivs
or any of Autoliv Personnels (as defined below) access to M/A-COMs computer,
telephone or other information technology networks, components or systems and
(ii) as a result of, with respect to, or arising from the actions (or any
failure to act) of Autoliv Personnel caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any such Autoliv Personnel. Autoliv Personnel shall mean all
personnel employed, engaged or otherwise furnished by Autoliv who are under
the Control of Autoliv in connection with the rendering of the Services by
M/A-COM or the receipt of Services by Autoliv pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Without limitation or duplication of clause (a), M/A-COM will indemnify,
reimburse and hold harmless Autoliv and its Indemnified Persons from and
against any Losses asserted against, imposed upon, suffered by or incurred by
Autoliv or any of its Indemnified Persons (i) as a result of any damage to or
corruption of any electronic information, data or information technology
infrastructure that Autoliv can reasonably demonstrate was caused by M/A-COMs
or any of M/A-COM Personnels access to Autolivs computer, telephone or other
information technology networks, components or systems and (ii) as a result
of, with respect to, or arising from the actions (or any failure to act) of
M/A-COM Personnel caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
such M/A-COM Personnel.

 

5.3 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event will either party be liable
(whether in tort, equity, contract, warranty or otherwise and notwithstanding
any fault, negligence, product liability, or strict liability) for any
indirect, punitive, incidental, exemplary, special, consequential or similar
damages, including business interruption, unavailability of any network,
downtime, lost business or profits, or loss or corruption of data sustained
by any Person arising from or related to this Agreement, including the Service
Attachment, or any use, inability to use or results of use of the Services or
otherwise, even if any Person was advised of the possibility of such damages.
In no event will M/A-COM be liable for an amount greater than the total
Service Costs actually received by M/A-COM for Services rendered pursuant to
this Agreement during the Term.

 

ARTICLE VI

_TERMINATION _

6.1 _Termination for Convenience_. Subject to the limitations set forth in the
Service Attachment, Autoliv will have the right to terminate any Service, in
whole or in part, upon fifteen days prior written notice to M/A-COM. Upon any
such termination, for the remainder of the Term, Autoliv will no longer be
entitled to such terminated Service. If all Services will have been migrated
or terminated under this provision prior to the expiration of this Agreement,
then M/A-COM or Autoliv will have the right to terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to the other party hereto.

 

6.2 _Termination for Default_. In the event that Autoliv fails to pay in full
for Services when due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, M/A-COM
will have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement if
Autoliv has failed to cure such default within five days following written
notice of the default. Except as set forth in the immediately 

 



5  preceding sentence, in the event that either party hereto defaults, in any
material respect, in the due performance or observance by it of any of the
terms, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, the non-
defaulting party will have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate
this Agreement if the defaulting party (i) has failed to cure such default
within fifteen days of written notice of default or if such default is such
that it will take more than fifteen days to cure, within an extended time
period which will be no longer than what is reasonably necessary to effect
performance or compliance (the " _Extended Cure Period_ ") or (ii) has
failed to diligently pursue the curing of such default within such Extended
Cure Period.

6.3 _Effect of Termination_. The provisions of  _Article III_ , _Article IV_
, _Article V_ , _Article VI_ , _Section 7.5_ and _Article VIII_ will survive
the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VII

_REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS_

7.1 _Compliance with Laws_. Each party hereto will comply, at its own expense
(subject to Autolivs obligation to pay to M/A-COM the Services Costs in
accordance with _Section 3.1_), with the provisions of all laws applicable to

description of the Services in this Agreement, (a) M/A-COM will not provide

assign, at all times, sufficient resources and qualified personnel as are
reasonably required in M/A-COMs reasonable judgment and discretion to perform
the Services in accordance with the standards set forth in the preceding
sentence.

7.4 _Access to Systems_. __

 

(a) Autoliv agrees that if Autoliv or any of its employees accesses M/A-COMs
computer, telephone or other information technology networks, components or
systems during the Term, then Autoliv and each of its employees with access to
such computer, telephone or other information technology networks, components
or systems will abide by M/A-COMs information technology, security and other
written policies applicable to such use provided to them, as in effect from
time to time, and will execute a copy of any reasonably requested
confidentiality agreements.

 



6 (b) M/A-COM agrees that if M/A-COM or any of its employees (or M/A-COM
Personnel) accesses Autolivs computer, telephone or other information
technology networks, components or systems during the Term, then M/A-COM and
each of its employees (and M/A-COM Personnel) with access to such computer,
telephone or other information technology networks, components or systems
will abide by Autolivs information technology, security and other written
policies applicable to such use provided to them, as in effect from time to
time, and will execute a copy of any reasonably requested confidentiality
agreements.

7.5 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Neither party hereto nor any
other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty on
behalf of either party hereto with respect to the Services, at law or in
equity, including with respect to merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose, and any such other representations or warranties are
hereby expressly disclaimed.

7.6 _Other Business_. Notwithstanding any other provision herein and for the
avoidance of doubt, M/A-COM may provide the same or similar services that
involve the same, similar or other resources as those used to provide the
Services to itself, its Affiliates and any other Person.

 

ARTICLE VIII

_MISCELLANEOUS _

8.1 _Relationship of the Parties_. The parties hereto agree that each party
hereto is engaged in a business that is independent from that of the other

and Autoliv are not partners, joint venturers, joint employers or co-
employers, (b) nothing contained herein is intended to create an agency

_M/A-COM Personnel_ "). As between Autoliv and M/A-COM, M/A-COM will
be responsible for any injury to the M/A-COM Personnel in the course of their
employment during the Term, except to the extent such injury is caused due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Autoliv. M/A-COM will assume

8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by M/A-COM or Autoliv
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other party hereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such consent will
be required for an assignment or a delegation by M/A-COM to any of its

of and be enforceable by M/A-COM and Autoliv and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except in connection with an assignment permitted
pursuant to this _Section 8.5_, in no event will M/A-COM be required to
provide any Service to any Person other than Autoliv or Auto Solutions. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

 



9 8.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Service Attachment)
constitutes the entire agreement by and between the parties pertaining to the
provision of the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements, arrangements and understandings of the parties with respect to
such subject matter. Nothing in this Agreement will expand any of the
parties obligations under the Purchase Agreement.

8.7 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
if, and only if, such amendment is in writing and signed by both parties
hereto. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived to the extent permitted
by applicable law if, and only if, such waiver is in writing and signed by
the party hereto granting the waiver. No failure or delay by either party
hereto in exercising any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder will
operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

8.8 _Interpretation_. The section and other headings and subheadings
contained in this Agreement and the Service Attachment are solely for the
purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto, and
will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or
the Service Attachment. All references to days or months will be deemed
references to calendar days or months. All references to " _$_ " will be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context
otherwise requires, any reference to " _Article_ " or " _Section_ " will be
deemed to refer to an article or a section of this Agreement, as applicable.
The words " _hereof_ ," " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The use of the term "
_including_ " herein means "including without limitation."

8.9 _Severability_. Each term or provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein are held, for
any reason, to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision will be ineffective to the extent but only to the extent of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remainder of such provision or provisions of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the removal of such offending provision
materially alters the burdens or benefit of either of the parties under this
Agreement, then the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith such
modifications to this Agreement, if any, as are appropriate to ensure
that the burdens and benefits of each party hereto under such modified
Agreement are reasonably comparable to the burdens and benefits originally
contemplated herein.

 

8.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. With the exception of the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, there will
exist no right of any Person to claim a beneficial interest in this Agreement
or any rights arising out of this Agreement.

 



10 8.11 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all rights,
powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in
respect hereof at law or in equity will be cumulative and not alternative, and
the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any right, power or remedy by a
party will not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such
right, power or remedy by such party.

8.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the parties
hereto will bear their own expenses (including all time and expenses of
counsel, financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent
accountants) incurred in connection with this Agreement.

 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of faxed or emailed signature pages), any one of which
need not contain the signatures of more than one party hereto, but all such
counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 

8.14 _No Set-Off_. The obligations under this Agreement will not be subject to
set-off for non-performance or any monetary or non-monetary claim by either
party hereto or any of its respective Affiliates under any other agreement
between the parties hereto or any of their respective Affiliates.

8.15 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Autoliv and its officers, directors, managers, employees, advisors,
financing sources, agents and representatives will not disclose
any confidential information about M/A-COM or any of its Affiliates obtained
as a result of the exercise of its rights or performance of its obligations
under this Agreement unless (i) disclosure is compelled by judicial or
administrative process, (ii) based on advice of such Persons counsel,
disclosure is compelled by other requirements of applicable Law or (iii) the
confidential information relates to the business and operations of Autoliv.
The obligations of Autoliv under this _Section 8.15(a)_ will survive the
termination or expiration of this Agreement.

(b) M/A-COM and its officers, directors, managers, employees, advisors,
financing sources, agents and representatives will not disclose any
confidential information about Autoliv or any of its Affiliates obtained as a
result of the exercise of its rights or performance of its obligations under
this Agreement unless (i) disclosure is compelled by judicial or
administrative process or (ii) based on advice of such Persons counsel,
disclosure is compelled by other requirements of applicable Law. The
obligations of M/A-COM under this _Section 8.15(c)_ will survive the
termination or expiration of this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, promptly after a
Service is terminated, each of Autoliv and M/A-COM will return or, with
written consent of the other party hereto, destroy (together with
certification to the other party of such destruction) all material and
property owned by the other party, including any and all material and property
of a proprietary nature involving the other party relevant to the provision of
that Service and no longer needed regarding the performance of other Services
under this Agreement

 



11  within thirty days after the applicable migration or termination. Upon
termination or expiration of this Agreement, each of Autoliv and M/A-COM will
return or, with written consent of the other party hereto, destroy (together
with certification to the other party of such destruction) any and all
material and property of a proprietary nature involving the other party in its
possession or control within thirty days after such termination or expiration
of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, (i) each party
hereto may pursue, at its discretion, enforcement of this _Section 8.15_ in
any court of competent jurisdiction (each, a " _Court_ "), and (ii) in no
event will either party hereto be held liable for the other partys legal fees
or costs in pursuit of such claim, unless there is a final determination by
such Court that the party pursuing such claim acted in manifest bad faith.

 

(e) The parties hereto agree that money damages would not be an adequate
remedy for any breach this _Section 8.15_, and any breach of the terms of
this _Section 8.15_ would result in irreparable injury and damage for which
neither party hereto would have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the
event of a breach or a threatened breach of this  _Section 8.15_, each party
hereto, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor at
law or in equity, will be entitled to specific performance or to seek
immediate injunctive or other equitable relief from a Court in order to
enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions of this _Section 8.15_
(without posting a bond or other security), without having to prove damages.
The terms of this _Section 8.15_ will not prevent either party hereto from
pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement.

8.16 _Delivery by Electronic Means_. This Agreement, the agreements referred
to herein, and each other agreement or instrument entered into in connection
herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or other electronic means, will be treated in all manner and respects
as an original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of either party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of a facsimile
machine or other electronic means to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a contract and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

give rise to any right of termination or other breach or default thereof, then
such Unassigned Contract will not be assigned and the parties hereto will

reasonable alternative to enable the Company to obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations under such Contract as of the Closing Date or as soon
as practicable thereafter (including through a sub-contracting, sub-licensing,
sub-participation or sub-leasing 

 



\- 4 -  agreement, or an arrangement under which such Transferor would enforce such
Unassigned Contract for the benefit of the Company, with the Company, to the
extent permissible, assuming such Transferors obligations and any and all
rights of such party against the other party thereto), and the Company will
assume and pay, perform and discharge any resulting or related economic burden
(including any related Tax). If the written approval of the Contemplated
Transactions by the other party to such Unassigned Contract is obtained, then
such written approval will constitute a confirmation (automatically and
without further action of the parties) that such Unassigned Contract is
assigned to the Company as of the Closing Date, and (automatically and without
further action of the parties) that the Liabilities (which constitute Assumed
Liabilities under this Agreement) with respect to such Unassigned Contract are
assumed by the Company as of the Closing Date.
