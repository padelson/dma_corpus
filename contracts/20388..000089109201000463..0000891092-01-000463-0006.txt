Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Articles of Merger, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the NGCL and the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and

and duties of the Company and Acquiror shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.04 Articles of

until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Subject to Section 5.06,

the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.   Section 1.06 Effect on Securities, Etc. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Acquiror, the Company or the holders of any securities of the Company:  
(a) Conversion of Securities. (i) Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 1.06(b)) shall be converted, subject to
Sections 1.06 (e) and (f), into the right to receive from Acquiror 0.6907
(such fraction, the "Exchange Ratio") of a fully paid and nonassessable
common share of Guarantor, par value U.S. $0.20 per share (the "Guarantor
Common Shares").   (ii) Each share in the non-voting class of exchangeable
shares (the "Exchangeco Shares") of CIT Exchangeco Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the province of Nova
Scotia ("Exchangeco"), shall remain outstanding, and the provisions attaching
thereto, the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement in respect thereof, dated
November 15, 1999, between the Company, 3026192 Nova Scotia Company and
Exchangeco and the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement in respect thereof,
dated November 15, 1999, between the Company, Exchangeco and Montreal Trust
Company of Canada (collectively, the "Exchangeco Documents"), shall each be
modified as required pursuant to the terms thereof to provide that, from and
after the Effective Time, each Exchangeco Share shall be exchangeable,
subject to Sections 1.06(e) and (f), for a fraction of a Guarantor Common
Share equal to the Exchange Ratio, and the foregoing fraction of a Guarantor
Common Share shall be substituted for shares of Company Common Stock for all
other purposes under the Exchangeco Documents.   (iii) The Special Voting
Stock of the Company (the "Special Voting Stock") shall be converted into a
special voting preference share of Guarantor, having the designations,
powers, preferences, rights, qualifications and limitations substantially
similar to the designations, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications and
limitations of the Special Voting Stock.   (b) Cancellation. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Guarantor, Acquiror or
any direct or indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Guarantor
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration
therefor and cease to exist.   (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. At the Effective Time, all options ("Company Stock Options") to
purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding, whether under the Company\'s
Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan, the Company\'s Transition   
-8-   Option Plan or otherwise (together, the "Company Stock Option
Plans"), shall be treated in accordance with Section 5.11 of this Agreement.
Rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any
employee stock purchase or restricted stock plan or any similar U.S. or
non-U.S. plan (collectively, the "Company ESPP") shall be treated as set
forth in Section 5.11 of this Agreement. Any rights to purchase Company
Common Stock under the Company\'s 401(k) plans shall be treated as set forth
in Section 5.12 of this Agreement.   (d) Capital Stock of Acquiror. Each
share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquiror issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall constitute one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time,
each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Acquiror common stock
shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio, Etc. If, during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Guarantor or the Company shall occur,
including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to the Merger or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.   (f)
Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing less than
one Guarantor Common Share shall be issued in exchange for Shares or
Exchangeco Shares upon the surrender for exchange of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the
"Certificates") or upon surrender for exchange of a certificate representing
Exchangeco Shares. In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder of
Shares or Exchangeco Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to a
fraction of a Guarantor Common Share upon surrender of Shares or Exchangeco
Shares for exchange shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into
account all certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price of the
Guarantor Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), as
reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or if such service is unavailable, a
service providing similar information selected by Acquiror and the Company)
on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time, in
the case of the Shares, or the trading day immediately preceding the date of
surrender, in the case of the Exchangeco Shares.   Section 1.07 Exchange of
Shares. (a) Exchange Agent. Acquiror shall cause to be supplied to or for
such bank or trust company as shall be designated by Acquiror and shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, as needed for exchange and
payment in accordance with this Section 1.07 through the Exchange Agent,
certificates evidencing the Guarantor Common Shares issuable pursuant to
Section 1.06(a), the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in exchange
for outstanding Shares pursuant to Section 1.06(f) and the cash or other
property in respect of any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 1.07(c).    -9-    (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
certificates evidencing Guarantor Common Shares and cash in lieu of
fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor solely (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole
Guarantor Common Shares which such holder has the right to receive in
accordance with Section 1.06(a) in respect of the Shares formerly evidenced
by such Certificate and (B) cash in respect of fractional shares as provided
in Section 1.06(f) (the Guarantor Common Shares and cash in respect of
fractional shares being referred to, collectively, as the "Merger
Consideration"), except that Shares held at the Effective Time in book-entry
form shall be exchanged for Merger Consideration in accordance with the
customary procedures of the Depository Trust Company.   The holder of each
Certificate, upon its exchange for Guarantor Common Shares, shall also
receive any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.07(c). Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled following the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, dividends
and distributions may be issued and paid in accordance with this Article I to
a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Shares is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 1.07(b) and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered,
each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented
Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, other than the payment of dividends or other distributions, to
evidence the ownership of the number of full Guarantor Common Shares, and
cash in respect of fractional shares, into which such Shares shall have been
so converted.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Guarantor Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Guarantor Common Shares such holder is entitled to
receive until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate
in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.07(b). Subject to applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole Guarantor Common Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Guarantor Common
Shares.   (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for Guarantor
Common Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting    -10-   such exchange shall have paid to Acquiror or
any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate for Guarantor Common Shares in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
establish to the satisfaction of Acquiror or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (e) Escheat. Neither Acquiror

any cash dividends or other distributions that the holder is entitled to
receive under Section 1.07(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or non-United States tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, such portion of
the Merger Consideration and other such amounts payable under Section 1.07(c)
that are withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been received by the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.   (g)

the holders of the Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.07
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Guarantor Common Shares.   Section 1.08 Stock Transfer Books. At
the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company.   Section 1.09 No Further Ownership Rights in
Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender
for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   Section
1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the    -11-   holder thereof, such Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as may be required
pursuant to this Article I; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Guarantor, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   Section 1.11 Tax Consequences. The parties hereto intend that
the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section

of the United States Treasury Regulations.   Section 1.12 Taking of
Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Acquiror and the Company will take,
and cause their affiliates to take, all such reasonable and lawful actions as

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with this
Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquiror, the officers and directors of the
Company and Acquiror immediately prior to the Effective Time are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.   ARTICLE II  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Acquiror as follows:   Section 2.01 Organization
and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is
an entity duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent the concept of
good standing exists in the applicable jurisdiction) in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite
corporate or other power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate
the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power or authority
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. A list of all subsidiaries of the Company together with the
jurisdiction of organization of each such subsidiary and the percentage of
each such subsidiary\'s outstanding capital stock owned by the Company or
another subsidiary of the Company (in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiaries,
without giving effect to any qualifying share ownerships of less than 1%) is
contained in Section 2.01 of the written disclosure schedule previously
delivered by the    -12-   Company to Acquiror (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"). Except as set forth in Section 2.01 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Company SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in,
or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity (other than its wholly-owned
subsidiaries), with respect to which interest the Company or a subsidiary has
invested (and currently owns) or is required to invest $10,000,000 or more,
excluding securities in any publicly-traded company held for investment by
the Company and comprising less than five-percent of the outstanding stock of
such company.   Section 2.02 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The
Company has heretofore made available to Acquiror a complete and correct copy
of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated By-laws, each as amended to date (the "Company Charter Documents"),
and will make available to Acquiror, as promptly as practicable, the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of each of its subsidiaries reasonably requested by Acquiror (the
"Subsidiary Documents"). All such Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary
Documents are in full force and effect, except in the case of Subsidiary
Documents where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is
in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, except for violations of the
documents which do not and are not reasonably likely to materially interfere
with the operations of such entity.   Section 2.03 Capitalization. The
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,210,000,000 shares of
the Company Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par

Section 2.03 or Section 2.11 of the Company Disclosure   -13-   Schedule
or the Company SEC Documents, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (including, without
limitation, registration rights) binding on the Company or any of

contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to provide
funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution

Adverse Effect. Each subsidiary of Guarantor is duly qualified to do business

would make any of the representations or warranties of Acquiror contained in
this Agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent Acquiror from performing or
cause Acquiror not to perform its covenants hereunder or cause any condition
to Acquiror\'s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied.   ARTICLE V   ADDITIONAL

Company and Guarantor of all information required to be contained therein,
the Company shall, and Acquiror shall, and shall cause Guarantor to, file
with the SEC, the definitive Proxy    -44-   Statement/Prospectus and

and the Company shall furnish to Guarantor all information concerning the
Company and the holders of capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably

distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.   No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the Company or

prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Acquiror, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Acquiror which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to either of the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.   (b) Acquiror shall cause Guarantor to include
as an exhibit to the Registration Statement tax opinions of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Wachtell, Lipton Rosen and Katz, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and to the Company, on the
basis of customary facts, representations, warranties, covenants and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions, that the Merger will
be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code that is not subject to
Section 367(a)(1) of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-(3)(c) (other than with respect to Company stockholders who
are or will be "five-percent transferee shareholders"    -45-   within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) and do not
enter into five-year gain recognition agreements in the form provided

the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. The
Company shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of
this Agreement and shall take all other reasonable action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders in favor of such
adoption. Acquiror shall cause Guarantor to vote any shares of Company Common
Stock with respect to which Guarantor or any Guarantor subsidiary
has beneficial ownership or other voting authority (including proxy
authority) to be voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement.   Section

the Company shall (and shall cause its subsidiaries and joint venture
partners to), during the period after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, (i) afford to the officers,

responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under
Section 5.01 and this Section 5.04 to comply in all material respects with

Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, a letter
(the "Company Affiliate Letter") identifying all persons who are anticipated
to be "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the

-47-   Acquiror prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting a
written agreement (a "Company Affiliate Agreement") in connection with
restrictions on affiliates under Rule 145 in a form mutually agreeable to the
Company and Acquiror.   Section 5.06 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a)
The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or
otherwise repealed for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective
Time of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors or officers of
the Company, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time by
law and then only to the minimum extent required by such law.   (b) The
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
(x) arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent as provided in the Company
Charter Documents or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the
date hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the Effective Time.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) any counsel
retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective Time
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, (ii) after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received,
provided that the Indemnified Parties shall be required to reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for such payments in the circumstances and to the
extent required by the Company Charter Documents, any applicable contract or
agreement with such Indemnified Party or applicable law, and (iii) the
Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld); and provided further that, in the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until the final disposition of any and all such claims. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
in each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless
there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on
any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties, in which case each Indemnified Person with respect to whom such a
conflict exists (or group of such Indemnified Persons who among them have no
such conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each
applicable jurisdiction.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to
indemnification agreements and employment agreements (the parties under such
agreements being referred to as the "Covered Persons") with the   
-48-   Company\'s directors and officers existing at or before the
Effective Time, provided such agreements do not violate Section 4.01(f).  
(d) In addition, Acquiror will provide, or cause the Guarantor to
provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time,
the Company\'s current directors and officers (as defined to mean those
persons insured under such policy) with an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance") that is no less favorable than the
existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Guarantor
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much
such coverage as possible for such amount.   (e) This Section shall survive
the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Indemnified Parties and the
Covered Persons, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and
the Covered Persons.   Section 5.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
materially untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any failure of the Company or
Acquiror, as the case may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and provided further that
failure to give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for
the purposes of Section 7.01(h) unless and except to the extent that
the failure to give such notice results in material prejudice to the other
party.   Section 5.08 Further Action/Tax Treatment.   (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use
all reasonable efforts to, and Acquiror shall cause Guarantor to use all
reasonable efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and
filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions
precedent to its obligations under this Agreement. The foregoing covenant
shall not include the obligation by Guarantor to agree to divest, abandon,
license, hold separate or take similar action with respect to any assets
(tangible or intangible) which are, or impose any liability which
is, material to Guarantor or the Company or material as compared against
the aggregate Merger Consideration.   (b) Each of Acquiror and the Company
shall, and Acquiror shall cause Guarantor to, use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not (both    -49-   before and
after the Effective Time) take any actions, or fail to take any action, which
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code that is not
subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-(3)(c) (other than with respect to Company stockholders who
are or will be "five-percent transferee shareholders" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) and do not enter into five-
year gain recognition agreements in the form provided in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-8). The parties hereto acknowledge that the
actions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement are not prohibited by
the preceding sentence. Acquiror shall, and shall cause Guarantor to, comply
with the reporting requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(6) and report, to the extent reporting is required by the Code
or the regulations thereunder, the Merger for income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Each of
Acquiror and the Company shall make, and shall cause their affiliates to
make, such representations, warranties and covenants as shall be requested
reasonably in the circumstances by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz in order for such firms to render their opinions
referred to in Section 5.01(b).   Section 5.09 Public Announcements.
Acquiror and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing (and in
the case of Acquiror, before Guarantor issues) any press release or making
any written public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that either party may, without the prior consent
of the other, issue such press release or make such public statement as may
upon the advice of counsel be required by law or the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC (including, without limitation, Rules 165 and 425
under the Securities Act and Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act), NYSE or the
Toronto Stock Exchange if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party.   Section 5.10 Guarantor Common Shares.   (a) Acquiror
shall obtain from Guarantor, and shall cause Guarantor to issue to Acquiror,

Company Common Stock in the Merger.   (b) Acquiror shall cause Guarantor to
use its best efforts to cause the Guarantor Common Shares to be delivered by
Acquiror to the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger to be listed,
upon official notice of issuance, on the NYSE prior to the Effective
Time.   (c) Acquiror shall cause Guarantor on a timely basis to take any
action required to be taken under non-U.S. securities laws in connection with
the issuance of Guarantor Common Shares in the Merger.   Section 5.11 Stock
Options and ESPP.   (a) At the Effective Time, and subject to the last
sentence of this Section 5.11(a), Acquiror shall take all necessary action to
provide that each outstanding Company Stock    -50-   Option will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the relevant Company stock option plan and applicable award agreement (and
separation agreement, if applicable), or other relevant instrument or
agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time (except as provided in the
last sentence of this Section 5.11(a)), except that, (i) each Company Stock
Option will be exercisable for that number of whole Guarantor Common Shares
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the
nearest whole number of Guarantor Common Shares and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the Guarantor Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock at which such
Company Stock option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent (each such Company
Stock Option, as modified, an "Adjusted Option"). With respect to any Company
Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option" as defined under Section
422(b) of the Code, the adjustment procedures set forth in this Section 5.11
shall be implemented in compliance with the provisions of Section 424(a) of
the Code (such that each applicable Adjusted Option shall continue to retain
its qualification as an "incentive stock option" under the Code). All Company
Stock Options, to the extent not vested and exercisable at the Effective
Time, shall become immediately vested and exercisable at the Effective
Time.   (b) Acquiror will cause Guarantor to take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Guarantor Common
Shares for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options and, if and to the
extent necessary to deliver to holders of Adjusted Options upon the exercise
of such options, Guarantor Common Shares registered pursuant to the
Securities Act and listed on the NYSE. At the Effective Time, Acquiror will
cause Guarantor to have a sufficient number of Guarantor Common Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Adjusted Options registered pursuant to the
Securities Act and listed on the NYSE.   (c) Beginning on the date hereof,
the Company shall not establish any new employee stock purchase plan or
extend the availability of the Company ESPP to any groups or categories of
employees not previously included in the Company ESPP, or, in either case,
implement any decisions to do the same, whether or not such decisions have
been communicated to employees. The Company shall take such action as is
necessary to end the then current offering period under the Company ESPP
prior to the Effective Time and to terminate such plan as of the
Effective Time. All shares of Company Common Stock under the Company ESPP
shall be treated as all other shares of Company Common Stock.   Section
5.12 Certain Employee Benefits.   (a) From the Effective Time through the
first anniversary thereof (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain the employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements set forth on Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, for the benefit of each employee of the Company or any subsidiary
of the Company who is an employee at the Effective Time or becomes an
employee during the Benefits Continuation Period (a "Company Employee"), and
including for the applicable beneficiaries of such Company Employees under
such plans, programs or arrangements, without termination, modification or
amendment effective during the Benefits Continuation Period (other than as
may    -51-   be required under applicable law). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement that may be to the contrary, the Company\'s
Executive Retirement Plan (including the Company\'s new Executive Retirement
Plan) shall be maintained by the Surviving Corporation indefinitely following
the Effective Time, provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to permit new participants to be added to the Executive Retirement
Plan after the Effective Time. With respect to any Company Employee Plan
listed on Section 2.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule which is not set
forth on Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide each Company Employee (and applicable beneficiaries
thereof) during the Benefits Continuation Period with employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefit provided under such
Company Employee Plans. In addition to the acceleration of vesting and
exercisability of all Company Stock Options provided in the last sentence of
Section 5.11(a), all restricted stock, SARs and other equity and equity-based
awards granted pursuant to the Company Employee Plans, to the extent not
vested (and exercisable, as the case may be) at the Effective Time, shall
become immediately fully vested (and exercisable, as the case may be) at the
Effective Time.   (b) After the Benefits Continuation Period the Surviving
Corporation shall provide the Company Employees with employee benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of subsidiaries of the Guarantor. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is understood that the Surviving Corporation shall have no
obligation to provide Company Employees with post-termination welfare or, to
the extent not already accrued at the Effective Time or, if applicable, the
end of the Benefits Continuation Period, pension benefits, except to the
extent required by applicable law or contractual agreement.   (c) With
respect to the benefits provided pursuant to this Section 5.12, (i) service
accrued by Company Employees during employment with the Company and its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized for
eligibility and vesting and, except with respect to defined benefit plans,
benefit accrual, (ii) any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the
extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under the
applicable Company Employee Plan) and eligibility waiting periods under any
group health plan shall be waived with respect to such Company Employees and
their eligible dependents, and (iii) Company Employees shall be given credit
for amounts paid under a Company Employee Plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the employee plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or the
applicable subsidiary of the Guarantor.   (d) The Company shall amend its
401(k) savings plans and any other employee benefits plan which permits
participants to elect to invest in stock of the Company, where necessary, to
preclude any additional purchases of stock of the Company, as of the date two
(2) days prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall communicate this
amendment to the participants in such plans.   (e) It is expressly agreed
that (i) the provisions of Section 5.12 are not intended to be for the
benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third party, including, without
limitation, any Company Employees and (ii) except as provided in Section
5.12(a), nothing herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation or any other
subsidiary of Guarantor from    -52-   amending or modifying any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement in any respect or terminating
or modifying the terms and conditions of employment or other service of any
particular employee or any other person.   (f) Except as set forth in this
Section 5.12 and in Section 5.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligations under this Agreement
with respect to benefits to employees of the Company from and after the
Effective Time.   Section 5.13 Accountants Letters. Upon reasonable notice
from the other, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause KPMG LLP to
deliver to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall use its best efforts to cause
PricewaterhouseCoopers to deliver to the Company, a letter covering such
matters as are reasonably requested by Acquiror or the Company, as the case
may be, and as are customarily addressed in accountants\' "comfort
letters."   Section 5.14 Compliance with State Property Transfer Statutes.
The Company agrees that it shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to
comply promptly with all requirements of applicable state property transfer
laws as may be required by the relevant state agency and shall take all
action necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be effected
in compliance with applicable state property transfer laws, except where the
failure to so comply will not materially affect the right to use or enjoy any
applicable property after the Effective Time. The Company, after consultation
with Acquiror, shall determine which actions must be taken prior to or after
the Effective Time to comply with applicable state property transfer laws.
The Company agrees to provide Acquiror with any documents required to be
submitted to the relevant state agency prior to submission, and the Company
shall not take any action to comply with applicable state property transfer
laws without Acquiror\'s prior consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Acquiror shall provide, and shall cause
Guarantor to provide, to the Company any assistance reasonably requested by
the Company with respect to such compliance.   Section 5.15 Conveyance
Taxes. Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications, or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees, and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby that are required or permitted to be
filed on or before the Effective Time, and the Company shall be responsible
for the payment of all such taxes and fees.   Section 5.16 Exchangeco
Shares.   (a) Each of Acquiror and the Company shall take, Acquiror shall
cause Guarantor to take, and the Company shall cause Exchangeco to take, all
action necessary or desirable to implement the provisions of Section
1.06(a)(ii) with respect to the modification of the Exchangeco Documents
following the Effective Time.   (b) Acquiror will cause Guarantor to take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
Guarantor Common Shares for delivery upon    -53-   exchange of the
Exchangeco Shares and to deliver to holders of Exchangeco Shares upon the
exchange thereof, Guarantor Common Shares registered pursuant to
the Securities Act and listed on the NYSE. At the Effective Time, Acquiror
will cause Guarantor to have a sufficient number of Guarantor Common Shares
issuable upon exchange of the Exchangeco Shares registered pursuant to the
Securities Act and listed on the NYSE.   (c) Acquiror will cause Guarantor
to take and the Company will cause Exchangeco to take all action necessary or
desirable to obtain the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
variation of exemptive relief granted by the securities commissions or
similar regulatory authorities in all of the provinces and territories in
Canada in favor of Exchangeco which may be required in connection with the
implementation of the provisions of Section 1.06(a)(ii) with respect to the
issuance of the Guarantor Common Shares on the exchange of the Exchangeable
Shares and with respect to the modification of the Exchangeco Documents as of
the Effective Time.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   Section

duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Acquiror and the Company;
or   (b) by either Acquiror or the Company, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated by September 30, 2001 (other than for the reasons set forth
in clause (c) below); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.01(b) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or
prior to such date; or   (c) by either Acquiror or the Company, if the
requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company shall not have been
obtained by September 30, 2001, or if the stockholders of the Company shall

disclosures to the Company\'s stockholders generally, whether or not
permitted pursuant to Section 4.02, which has the effect of any of the
foregoing (it being understood and agreed that a communication by the Board
of Directors of the Company to the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f)(3) of the Exchange Act, or any similar type of communication to the
Company\'s stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer, shall not be deemed to constitute a basis for
termination under this Section 7.01(e)); or   (f) by Acquiror or the
Company, if any representation or warranty of the Company or Acquiror,
respectively, set forth in this Agreement shall be untrue when made,
such    -57-   that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(a) or
6.03(a), as the case may be, would not be satisfied (a "Terminating
Misrepresentation"); provided that if such Terminating Misrepresentation is
curable prior to September 30, 2001 (or, in the case of the representation
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 2.06(a), thirty (30) days after notice
thereof by Acquiror to the Company, if earlier) by the Company or Acquiror,

exercise such reasonable best efforts, neither Acquiror nor the Company,
respectively, may terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(f); or  
(g) by Acquiror, if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have
become untrue such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) would not
be satisfied, or by the Company, if any representation or warranty
of Acquiror shall have become untrue such that the condition set forth in
Section 6.03(a) would not be satisfied (in either case, a "Terminating
Change"), in either case other than by reason of a Terminating Breach (as
hereinafter defined); provided that if any such Terminating Change is curable
prior to September 30, 2001 (or, in the case of the representation referred
to in clause (ii) of Section 2.06(a), thirty (30) days after notice thereof
by Acquiror to the Company, if earlier) by the Company or Acquiror, as the
case may be, through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, and for so
long as the Company or Acquiror, as the case may be, continues to exercise
such reasonable best efforts, neither Acquiror nor the Company, respectively,
may terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(g); or   (h) by
Acquiror or the Company, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company or Acquiror, respectively, set forth in this Agreement
such that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(b) or 6.03(b), as the
case may be, would not be satisfied (a "Terminating Breach"); provided
that, except for any breach of the Company\'s obligations under Section 4.02,
if such Terminating Breach is curable prior to September 30, 2001 by the
Company or Acquiror, as the case may be, through the exercise of its
reasonable best efforts and for so long as the Company or Acquiror, as the
case may be, continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts, neither
Acquiror nor the Company, respectively, may terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.01(h).   Section 7.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of
any party hereto or any of its affiliates, directors, officers or
stockholders except that the Company or Acquiror may have liability or
obligations as set forth in Section 7.03 and as set forth in or contemplated
by Section 8.01 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
relieve the Company or Acquiror from liability for any willful breach hereof
or willful misrepresentation herein (it being understood that (x) the
provisions of Section 7.03 do not constitute a sole or exclusive remedy for
such willful breach or misrepresentation and (y) the mere existence of a
Material Adverse Effect, by itself, shall not constitute such a willful
breach).   Section 7.03 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in this
Section 7.03, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided,
however, that if the Merger is not consummated Acquiror and the Company shall

shall pay to Guarantor and Acquiror their respective Expenses relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a combined amount not to

Section 5.02, such breach occurred in response to, or to facilitate, an
Acquisition Proposal) or (2) the Alternative Transaction Condition

relevant condition, in each case as described in the aforesaid Sections, as
applicable; provided that, in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Fee or any Expenses to Acquiror, nor shall Acquiror be required to pay
any Expenses to the Company if, immediately prior to the termination of this
Agreement, the entity otherwise entitled to receive such fee and/or expenses
was in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement or, in the
case of Acquiror, Guarantor was in material breach of the Guarantee.   (g)

sole and exclusive remedy of the Company upon a termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (h), regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such termination; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any willful breach of this Agreement or any
willful misrepresentation hereunder giving rise to such termination.   (h)
Subject to Section 7.03(g), if a party is entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to more than one clause of Section 7.01, such party
shall be entitled to receive the Fee and Expenses to which it is entitled as
a result of any such termination, provided that in no event shall there be
any duplication of payment.   ARTICLE VIII   GENERAL PROVISIONS

the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards

amendment may be made which by law requires approval by such stockholders
without such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   Section 8.05 Waiver.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may with respect to
any other party hereto (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.  
Section 8.06 Headings; Interpretation. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement that may be to the contrary, nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to require any party hereto or its   
-63-   affiliates to take any action to the extent that such action is
prohibited by applicable law or to refrain from taking any action to the
extent that such action is required by applicable law.   Section 8.07
Severability. (a) If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any material manner adverse to any party. Upon a determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.   (b) The Company and Acquiror agree that
the Fee provided in Section 7.03(b) is fair and reasonable in the
circumstances. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall nonetheless, by a
final, nonappealable judgment, determine that the amount of the Fee exceeds
the maximum amount permitted by law, then the amount of the Fee shall be
reduced to the maximum amount permitted by law in the circumstances, as
determined by such court of competent jurisdiction.   Section 8.08 Entire
Agreement. This Agreement and the Guarantor\'s guarantee hereof constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings

both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matters hereof and thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein or therein.   Section 8.09 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that all or any of the
rights of Acquiror hereunder may be assigned to Guarantor or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Guarantor, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder.   Section 8.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, including, without limitation, by way
of subrogation, other than Section 5.06 (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties and Covered Persons and may be enforced by
such Indemnified Parties and Covered Persons) and Section 7.03 (which
contains provisions intended to be for the benefit of Guarantor and may be
enforced by Guarantor).   Section 8.11 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver;
Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in
the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed
to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation,
warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.   
-64-    Section 8.12 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and fully performed within

Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.   Section 8.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF
ACQUIROR AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES (AND IN RESPECT OF ANY
DISPUTE IN RESPECT OF THE GUARANTEE, ACQUIROR SHALL CAUSE GUARANTOR TO
WAIVE), TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   Section 8.15 Performance of Guarantee.
Unless otherwise previously performed, Acquiror shall cause Guarantor to
perform all of its obligations under the Guarantee.   [REMAINDER OF THIS
PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]    -65-    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Acquiror

("Guarantor") irrevocably guarantees each and every representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement and other obligation of Acquiror, and/or any of its
permitted assigns (and where any such representation or warranty is made to
the knowledge of Acquiror, such representation or warranty shall be deemed
made to the knowledge of Guarantor), and the full and timely performance of
their respective obligations under the provisions of the foregoing Agreement.
This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collection, and
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and
unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of Acquiror\'s obligations
or liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of the Agreement),
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee, as well as any
provision requiring or contemplating performance by Guarantor.   Guarantor
hereby waives, for the benefit of the Company, (i) any right to require the
Company as a condition of payment or performance by Guarantor, to proceed
against Acquiror or pursue any other remedy whatsoever and (ii) to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be
derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is
available to Acquiror.   Without limiting in any way the foregoing
guarantee, Guarantor covenants and agrees to take all actions to enable
Acquiror to adhere to each provision of the Agreement which requires an act
or omission on the part of Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries to enable
Acquiror to comply with its obligations under the Agreement.   The
provisions of Article VIII of the Agreement are incorporated herein, mutatis
mutandis, except that notices and other communications hereunder to Guarantor
