Escrow Agent; and

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (c) $106,000,000, less (i) the amount by which

 2.6 _Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (a) At least two (2) but not more than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller, in good faith and in
consultation with Buyer, shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a pro forma
consolidated balance sheet of Seller and the Subsidiaries which sets out
Sellers good faith, reasonable estimate of the consolidated assets and
liabilities of Seller and the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (excluding
the Excluded Seller Assets and the Retained Seller Liabilities), (ii) based on
such balance sheet, a summary calculation of the Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), and (iii) a certificate from Seller to the
effect that Estimated Net Working Capital was determined in good faith in
accordance with the provisions of this _Sec  tion 2.6(a)_ and in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied with the Financial Statements (the "
_Accounting Principles_ "). Promptly thereafter, and before the Closing Date,
Seller and Buyer shall review such pro forma consolidated balance sheet and
Estimated Net Working Capital calculation and shall use good faith, reasonable
efforts to resolve any concern or disagreement raised by Buyer with respect to
such documents, and Sellers determination of the Estimated Net Working
Capital shall be subject to Buyers acceptance (acting reasonably). If the
Estimated Net Working Capital is a negative amount, such negative amount shall
be deducted from the $106,000,000 payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_. For purposes of aiding in the understanding of this _Section
2.6(a)_ , _Schedule 2.6(a)_ contains a sample calculation of Sellers and the
Subsidiaries consolidated net working capital based  on the audited
balance sheet for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2004 included in the
Financial Statements.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (b) As promptly as practicable, but not later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers determination of
the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Net Working Capital_ "). If the Closing Net Working Capital, as
determined by Buyer, is a positive amount, such amount shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties.

  
   

 8

  

   
        

 

  |  

  (c) If the Closing Net Working Capital, as determined
by Buyer, is a negative amount, Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the
date of its receipt of Buyers statement of determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital to review Buyers determination. Buyer shall provide Seller
and its accountants reasonable access to Buyers books and records and the
reasonable availability and cooperation of Buyers employees to the extent
reasonably necessary for Sellers review of Buyers determination of the
Closing Net Working Capital. Upon completion of its review (and in any event
within the required thirty (30)-day period), Seller shall submit to Buyer a
letter regarding Sellers concurrence or disagreement with the accuracy of
Buyer s determination of the Closing Net Working Capital. Seller may
dispute the existence, omission or amount of any item reflected in the Closing
Net Working Capital, but only on the basis that such existing or omitted item
or such amount is inconsistent with the definition of Net Working Capital
contained in this Agreement and the Accounting Principles or that the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital is mathematically incorrect.
Unless Seller delivers a letter disagreeing with the calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital within such thirty (30) day period, the Closing
Net Working Capital shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.
Following delivery of such letter of disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of
such letter) cause their respective Representatives to confer with each other
with a view to resolving such disagreement.

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) If Sellers and Buyers Representatives are
unable to resolve such disagreement within thirty (30) days after the date of
delivery of Sellers letter (or longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties),
each of Buyer and Seller shall submit a position with respect to each item in
dispute to a mutually acceptable firm of Independent Accountants for review
and final determination. The determination of the Independent Accountants with
respect to such disagreement and the accuracy of the Closing Net Working
Capital as a result shall be completed within thirty (30) days after the
appointment of the Independent Accountants and shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties. The Independent Accountants shall adopt the
position of either Buyer or Sel  ler with respect to each item in dispute
based upon which position more accurately reflects the Net Working Capital as
of the Closing Date in accordance with the definition thereof. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated between Buyer
and Seller (such allocation to be finally determined by the Independent
Accountants) in such a way that Buyer shall be responsible for that portion of
the fees and expenses equal to such fees and expenses multiplied by a

 pay to Seller the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately
available funds; provided, however, that such payment shall not exceed the

Capital. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is a negative amount and the
Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital (i.e., the Estimated Net Working Capital is closer to $0.00 than the
Final Closing Net Working Capital), Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the

adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 of dispute by Seller must include the basis for such dispute, which shall be

(ii) the Buyer 2005 EBITDA Statement includes one or more mathematical errors.
Seller shall provide to Buyer Sellers proposed determination of the 2005
EBITDA. If (x) by written notice to Buyer, Seller accepts a written

Seller fails to deliver any notice of dispute in compliance with this _Section
2.11(a)_ with respect to such a determination by Buyer within the prescribed
thirty (30)-day period (which failure shall result in Seller being deemed to
have irrevocably accepted and agreed with Buyers determination of the 2005
EBITDA), Buyers determination of the 2005 EBITDA shall be  final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |

delivery of such dispute notice) cause their respective Representatives to
confer with each other with a view to resolving such dispute. If the Parties
Representatives are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days
after the date of delivery of Sellers dispute notice, Seller and Buyer shall
refer the dispute to a mutually acceptable firm of Independent Accountants for
review and final determination of the 2005 EBITDA. In taking such action, e 
ach of Seller and Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
referral of the dispute to the Independent Accountants, deliver to the
Independent Accountants (with a copy simultaneously delivered to the other
Party) such Partys one-time determination of the 2005 EBITDA, which
determination may be different from any amount previously proffered by such
Party (each a " _2005 Final Submission_ "). The Independent Accountants may
request of Seller or Buyer such documents and information as may be necessary
or appropriate for proper determination of the 2005 EBITDA, and the Parties
shall cooperate to promptly satisfy any such request. The Independent
Accountants may only select either Sellers or Buyers 2005 Final Submission
as the correct determination, and may not make their own independent
determination of the 2005 EBITDA. The determination by the Independent
Accountants of the 2005 EBITDA shall be final, binding and concl  usive on
the Parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants
shall be paid by whichever of Seller or Buyer is the Party whose 2005 Final
Submission is not selected by the Independent Accountants as the correct
determination of the 2005 EBITDA.

determination by the Independent Accountants, or the deemed acceptance by
Seller (as the case may be) of, the 2005 EBITDA:

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (i) if the 2005 EBITDA is at least $14,280,000, Seller

the release and payment to it of $7,000,000 of the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount
plus all accrued

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (ii) if the 2005 EBITDA is less than $14,280,000,
Buyer shall be entitled under the provisions of the EBITDA Test Escrow
Agreement to the release and payment to it of $7,000,000 of the EBITDA Test
Escrow Amount plus all accrued interest or other income earned on such portion
of the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount, and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to
have been adjusted downwards by such $7,000,000 (but not by any such accrued
interest or other income earned thereon).

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) For purposes of aiding in the understanding of
this _Section 2.11_ , _Schedule 2.11(d)_ contains a sample calculation of
Sellers budgeted consolidated EBITDA (excluding EBITDA of Tech Group Asia)

compiled on a basis consistent with Sellers audited financial statements for
the fiscal year ended June 26, 2004 (excluding EBITDA of Tech Group Asia).

forth in this _Section 2.11(d)_ and on _Schedule 2.11(d)_ are referred to as
the " _2005 EBITDA Accounting Principles_ ".

The 2006 Nektar EBITDA and, if applicable, the Extended Nektar EBITDA Test Criteria shall be determined, and any payment to Seller or Buyer based thereon, shall be paid, as follows:

statement and a segmented income statement relating solely to the Nektar
Business, and, based thereon, Buyers written summary determination of the

financial statements and summary determination shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP in a manner consistent with the preparation of Sellers audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2004 (except to the
extent required by changes in GAAP or

Principles. If the Buyer 2006 Nektar EBITDA Statement specifies that the 2006
Nektar EBITDA is equal to or greater than the 2006 Nektar EBITDA Target, such
specification shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. If the
Buyer 2006 Nektar EBITDA Statement specifies that the 2006 EBITDA is less than
the 2006 Nektar EBITDA Target, Seller shall have thirty (30) days to review
the Buyer 2006 Nektar EBITDA Statement and to notify Buyer in writing of any
dispute as to the correctness of the Buyer 2006 Nektar EBITDA Statement. Any
such notice of dispute by Seller must include the basis for such dispute,

Statement has not been calculated in accordance with the Nektar EBITDA
Accounting Principles, or (ii) the Buyer 2006 Nektar EBITDA Statement incl 
udes one or more mathematical errors. Seller shall provide to Buyer Sellers

deliver any notice of dispute in compliance with this _Section 2.12(a)_ with
respect to such a determination by Buyer within the prescribed thirty (30)-day
period (which failure shall result in Seller being deemed to have irrevocably

  (b) If, within the prescribed thirty (30)-day period,

Seller and Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the delivery of such dispute notice) cause their respective
Representatives to confer with each other with a view to resolving such
dispute. If the Parties Representatives are unable to resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of Sellers dispute notice,
Seller and Buyer shall refer the dispute to a mutually acceptable firm of
Independent Accountants for review and final determination of the 2006 Nektar
EBITDA. In taking su  ch action, each of Seller and Buyer shall, within

Accountants, deliver to the Independent Accountants (with a copy
simultaneously delivered to the other Party) such Partys one-time
determination of the 2006 Nektar EBITDA, which determination may be different

Submission_ "). The Independent Accountants may request of Seller or Buyer
such documents and information as may be necessary or appropriate for proper
determination of the 2006 Nektar EBITDA, and the Parties shall cooperate to
promptly satisfy any such request. The Independent Accountants may only select
either Sellers or Buyers 2006 Final Submission as the correct determination,
and may not make their own independent determination of the 2006 Nektar
EBITDA. The determination by the Independent Accountants of the 2006 Nektar
EB  ITDA shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be paid by whichever

the Extended Nektar EBITDA (as determined at the applicable time provided
below) is equal to or greater than the 2006 Nektar EBITDA Target plus $255,000
for each  monthly period after June 24, 2006 (such aggregate amount being
the " _Extended Nektar EBITDA Target_ "), Seller shall be entitled to payment
from escrow under the EBITDA Test Escrow Agreement of $7,000,000 of the EBITDA
Test Escrow Amount plus all accrued interest or other income earned on such
portion of the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount. Buyer shall calculate the Extended
Nektar EBITDA as soon as practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15)
days) following the end of each monthly period ending on or before the
Extended Nektar EBITDA Test Termination Date. The first such time (if any)
that Buyer determines that the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended
Nektar EBITDA is equal to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target,
Buyer shall deliver written notice of such determination to Seller, and such
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (e) Unless Buyer has already delivered to Seller
written notice that the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar
EBITDA is equal to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target (as
contemplated in _Section 2.12(d)_ ), within thirty (30) days after the
Extended Nektar EBITDA Test Termination Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
consolidated income statement and a segmented income statement relating solely
to the Nektar Business, and, based thereon, Buyers written summary
determination of the Extended Nektar EBITDA (the " _Extended Nektar EBITDA
Statement_ "). If the Extended Nektar EBITDA Statement specifies that the
aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA is equal to or greater
than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target, su  ch specification shall be 
final, binding and

  
   

 17

  

   
        

 

  |  

 conclusive on the Parties. If the Extended Nektar EBITDA Statement specifies
that the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA is less than
the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target, Buyer will also deliver to Seller a list of
any amendments to the Nektar Supply Agreement and any waivers by Buyer or Tech
Group North America (or any permitted successor entity or permitted assignee
of the Nektar Business which is an Affiliate of Buyer) of breaches of the
Nektar Supply Agreement by Nektar (or any successor or assign thereof), in
either case, made after the Closing Date and prior to the Extended Nektar
EBITDA Test Termination Date (the " _Nektar Disclosure Statement_ "), and
Seller shall have thirty (30) days to review the consolidated income
statement, the segmented income statement, the Extended Nektar EBITDA
Statement and the Nektar Disclosure Statement (if any) and to notify Buyer in
writi  ng of any dispute as to the correctness of Buyers determination of
the Extended Nektar EBITDA. Any such notice of dispute by Seller must include
the basis for such dispute, which shall be limited to only disputing that (i)
Buyers determination of the Extended Nektar EBITDA has not been calculated in
accordance with the 2006 Nektar Accounting Principles, (ii) the Extended
Nektar EBITDA Statement includes one or more mathematical errors, or (iii) if
Buyer made or gave, or caused or permitted Tech Group North America (or any
permitted successor entity or permitted assignee of the Nektar Business which
is an Affiliate of Buyer) to make or give (A) any amendment to the Nektar
Supply Agreement or (B) any waiver of a breach by Nektar under the Nektar
Supply Agreement after the Closing Date and prior to the Extended Nektar
EBITDA Test Termination Date, then but for such amendment or waiver (as
applicable), the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITD  A
would have been equal to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target.
Seller shall provide to Buyer Sellers proposed determination of the Extended
Nektar EBITDA. If (x) by written notice to Buyer, Seller accepts the
determination in the Extended Nektar EBITDA Statement that the aggregate 2006
Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA is less than the Extended Nektar
EBITDA Target, or (y) Seller fails to deliver any notice of dispute in
compliance with this _Section 2.12(e)_ with respect to the Extended Nektar
EBITDA Statement within the prescribed thirty (30)-day period (which failure
shall result in Seller being deemed to have irrevocably accepted and agreed
with the determination in the Extended Nektar EBITDA Statement), the
determination set forth in the Extended Nektar EBITDA Statement shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (f) If, within the prescribed thirty (30)-day period,
Seller delivers written notice to Buyer in compliance with _Section 2.12(e)_
of Sellers dispute with the determination of the Extended Nektar EBITDA,
Seller and Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the delivery of such dispute notice) cause their respective
Representatives to confer with each other with a view to resolving such
dispute. If the Parties Representatives are unable to resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of Sellers dispute notice,
Seller and Buyer shall refer the dispute to a mutually acceptable firm of
Independent Accountants for review and final determination of the Extended
Nektar EBITDA. In taking suc  h action with respect to a claim raised by
Seller described in clause (i) or (ii) of _Section 2.12(e)_ , each of Seller
and Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Independent Accountants such Partys
one-time determination of the Extended Nektar EBITDA (which determination may
be different

  
   

 18

  

   
        

 

  |  

 from any amount previously proffered by such party). The Independent
Accountants may request of Seller or Buyer such documents and information as
may be necessary or appropriate for proper determination of the Extended
Nektar EBITDA, and the Parties shall cooperate to promptly satisfy any such
request. The Independent Accountants may only select either Sellers or
Buyers determination of the Extended Nektar EBITDA as the correct
determination, and may not make their own independent determination of the
Extended Nektar EBITDA. The determination by the Independent Accountants of
the Extended Nektar EBITDA shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Parties, and the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall
be paid by whichever of Seller or Buyer is the Party whose determination of
the Extended Nektar EBITDA is not selected by the Independent Accountants as
the corr  ect determination.  In taking such action with respect to a claim
raised by Seller described in clause (iii) of _Section 2.12(e)_ , each of
Seller and Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Independent Accountants such
Partys written arguments (including factual bases) in support of its
position. The Independent Accountants may request of Seller or Buyer such
documents and information as may be necessary or appropriate for proper
determination of such dispute, and the Parties shall cooperate to promptly
satisfy any such request. The Independent Accountants shall determine, based
on the written arguments and factual information provided to them, whether the
aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA would have been equal
to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target but for the amendment(s)
to the Nektar Supply Agreement and/or the waiver of breach by Nektar under the
Nektar Supply Agreement after the Closing Date (as applicable)  raised by
Seller in its notice of dispute. If the Independent Accountants determine in
favor of Sellers position, such determination will be deemed to constitute a
decision that the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA was
equal to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target.

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (g) Within five (5) Business Days after delivery to
Seller of either (x) Buyers written notice under _Section 2.12(d)_ that the
aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA is equal to or greater
than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target or (y) the Extended Nektar EBITDA
Statement which indicates that the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended
Nektar EBITDA is equal to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target,
and otherwise within five (5) Business Days after final agreement of Seller
and Buyer, the final determination by the Independent Accountants, or the
deemed acceptance by Seller (as the case may be) of, the Extended Nektar
EBITDA:

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (i) if the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended
Nektar EBITDA is (or is deemed to be) equal to or greater than the Extended
Nektar EBITDA Target, Seller shall be entitled under the provisions of the
EBITDA Test Escrow Agreement to the release and payment to it of $7,000,000 of
the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount plus all accrued interest or other income earned
on the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount; and

  
     



  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (ii) if the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended
Nektar EBITDA is less than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target, Buyer shall be
entitled under the provisions of the EBITDA Test Escrow Agreement to the

  
   

 19

  

   
        

 

  |  

 

  |  

 release and payment to it of $7,000,000 of the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount
plus all accrued interest or other income earned on such portion of the EBITDA
Test Escrow Amount, and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to have been
adjusted downwards by such $7,000,000 (but not by any such accrued interest or
other income earned thereon).

  
---|---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     



  |  

  (h) For purposes of aiding in the understanding of
this _Section 2.12_ with respect to the calculation of the 2006 Nektar EBITDA
and the Extended Nektar EBITDA, _Schedule 2.12(h)_ contains a sample
calculation of Sellers budgeted EBITDA to be generated from the Nektar
Business for the full fiscal year ended June 24, 2006 based on Sellers 2006
Annual Operating Plan. Subschedules 1 through 5 of _Schedule 2.12(h)_
represent the detail budget compilation of the 2006 Nektar EBITDA and, if
applicable, the Extended Nektar EBITDA. Seller and Buyer agree that the 2006
Nektar EBITDA and, if applicable, the Extended Nektar EBITDA shall be
calculated and determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. Seller
represents and warrants to Bu  yer that the sample calculation set forth on
_Schedule 2.12(h)_ was compiled on a basis consistent with Sellers audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2004 (excluding EBITDA
of Tech Group Asia). For purposes of this Agreement, the 2006 Nektar EBITDA
and Extended Nektar EBITDA accounting principles set forth in this _Section_
2.12(h) and on _Schedule_ 2.12(h) are referred to as the " _2006 EBITDA
Accounting Principles_ ".

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (i) For purposes of _Section 2.12(e)_ and _2.12(f)_ ,
an "amendment" to the Nektar Supply Agreement shall mean any amendment to the
terms of the Nektar Supply Agreement made pursuant to Section 15.6 of the
Nektar Supply Agreement; provided, however, that the following shall not
constitute an amendment to the Nektar Supply Agreement: (i) changes,
modifications, amendments, supplements or adjustments to the Manufacturing
Requirements (as defined in the Nektar Supply Agreement) or to Exhibit B to
the Nektar Supply Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3 or Exhibit B
of the Nektar Supply Agreement (as such terms are in effect on the date
hereof), (ii) changes, modifications, amendments, supplements or adjustments
expressly contemplated, permitted or requi  red by the terms of Section 3.6
or Exhibit C of the Nektar Supply Agreement (as such terms are in effect on
the date hereof), (iii) changes, modifications, supplements, adjustments or
amendments to pricing or costs (including pursuant to any cost improvement
reductions) and any component thereof expressly contemplated, permitted or
required by the terms of Exhibit A to the Nektar Supply Agreement (as such
terms are in effect on the date hereof), (iv) changes, modifications,
supplements, adjustments or amendments made pursuant to or based upon any
decisions, determinations, actions, adjustments or resolutions of the Steering
Committee that do not conflict with any express requirement of the Nektar
Supply Agreement (as such requirements are in effect on the date hereof);
provided, however, that any decision made by the Nektar Steering Committee
pursuant to the authority granted to it under the Nektar Supply Agreement
would not constitute an "amendment" for purpo  ses of _Sections 2.12(e)_ and
_2.12(f)_ , (v) decisions made by Nektar Therapeutics pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.2 of the Nektar Supply Agreement (as such terms are in effect on the
date hereof), or (vi) any binding determination of an independent third party
pursuant to the terms

  
   

20

  

   
        

 

  |  

 Section 2.2 of the Nektar Supply Agreement (as such terms are in effect on
the date hereof).

  
---|--- 
   

  2.13 _Buyer Cooperation With Seller Review of EBITDA
Determinations_. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
cooperate reasonably with Seller in facilitating Sellers review of Buyers
initial determinations of the 2005 EBITDA, 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended
Nektar EBITDA, including making available to Seller and its Representatives,
to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, the books, records, work papers
and personnel of Buyer and its Representatives that were used in Buyers
initial determinations of the 2005 EBITDA, 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended
Nektar EBITDA.

 

  2.14 _Fiscal Year Changes_. For all purposes of
_Sections 2.11_ , _2.12_ and _2.15_ , the fiscal year-end of each Subsidiary
(including any permitted successor entity or permitted assignee of the Nektar
Business which is an Affiliate of Buyer) shall be deemed to fall on the last
Saturday in June of such fiscal year, notwithstanding any actual change of
fiscal year of the Subsidiaries (or any of them) that may be effectuated based
on the post-Closing incorporation of the Subsidiaries into Buyers
consolidated accounting or based on any other post-Closing transaction or
event that requires or results in a change of fiscal year or an interim
closing of the books or other similar accounting event that would have the
effect of shortening or otherwise changing the fiscal year of the Subsidiaries
(o  r any of them).

  

 2.15 _Post Closing Conduct of the Business_. Any earnout payments pursuant to _Sections 2.11_ and _2.12_ are contingent on the performance of the Business and there are no guaranteed minimum 2005 EBITDA, Nektar EBITDA, Extended Nektar EBITDA or other earnout payments under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer will be free to operate the Business as the Buyer deems appropriate in its sole discretion and shall have no obligation to act in any manner in an attempt to maximize 2005 EBITDA, Nektar EBITDA or Extended Nektar EBITDA; provided, however, that, following the Closing Date and until the completion of the Subsidiaries 2006 fiscal year (as currently in effect) or, if the provisions of _Sections 2.12(d)_ through _2.12(g)_   come into effect, until the earlier of (i) the delivery of written notice that the aggregate 2006 Nektar EBITDA and Extended Nektar EBITDA is equal to or greater than the Extended Nektar EBITDA Target (as contemplated in _Sections 2.12(d)_ ) and (ii) the Extended Nektar EBITDA Test Termination Date, Buyer will not, nor will it cause or permit Tech Group North America (or any permitted successor entity or permitted assignee of the Nektar Business which is an Affiliate of Buyer) to (i) take any action, the primary purpose of which is to reduce 2005 EBITDA, 2006 Nektar EBITDA or Extended Nektar EBITDA with the intention to reduce any earnout payments due under _Sections 2.11_ or _2.12_ , or (ii) assign or transfer the Nektar Supply Agreement (other than in connection with the merger or sale of substantially all of the assets of Buyer where the successor entity agrees in writing to assume and perform all of Buyers obligations under this Agreement), unless Buyer agrees to the release a  nd payment to Seller at the time of such assignment and transfer of $7,000,000 of the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount plus all accrued interest or other income earned on such portion of the EBITDA Test Escrow Amount. Subject to Sellers rights under _Sections 2.11_ and _2.12_ and Buyers covenants and obligations under this _Section 2.15_ , neither Seller nor the Shareholders shall be entitled to, and shall not, make any claims against Buyer alleging that Buyer or any of its Affiliates actions or omission in the operation of the Business reduced 2005 EBITDA, 2006 Nektar EBITDA or Extended Nektar 

  

21

  

   
  

 EBITDA or otherwise reduced the earnout payments due under this Agreement
from what they otherwise might have been.

 

  2.16 _Alternative to Independent Accountants
Determination_. If the Independent Accountants advise Seller and Buyer in
writing that they are unwilling to make any of the determinations described in
_Section 2.11(b)_ , _2.12(b)_ or _2.12(f)_ or if the Independent Accountants
are unable to do so within sixty (60) days after referral to them of the
dispute in question, either Seller or Buyer may, by written notice to the
Independent Accountants and to the other Party, terminate the Independent
Accountants engagement with respect to such determination and require that
such determination be made pursuant to the dispute resolution proceedings
under _Section 12.3_ , whereupon Seller and Buyer shall promptly refer such
determination to the dispute resolution proceedings under _Section 12.3_   ;
provided, however, that in the event Buyer or Seller fails to cooperate
reasonably and on a timely basis in providing the Independent Accountants with
information either required to be provided by such Party under _Section
2.11(b)_ , _2.12(b)_ or _2.12(f)_ or otherwise reasonably requested of such
Party by the Independent Accountants to permit the Independent Accountants to
render their determination, then, as to such Party, the sixty (60)-day period
shall be suspended until such party has given such cooperation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Independent Accountants request
additional documents or information of either Seller or Buyer, and the time
required for Seller or Buyer to comply with such request (acting promptly and
in good faith) and for the Independent Accountants to review such additional
documents or information would result in such sixty (60)-day period being
exceeded, such period will be extended by the amount of time needed by the
Independent Accountants (  acting promptly and in good faith) to complete
its review of such documents or information.

 

  2.17 _Pay-Off of Indebtedness_. It is contemplated by
the Parties that, upon the Closing, all Indebtedness of Seller and any
Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to Closing (other than Seller or
Subsidiary obligations under the capital leases referred to on _Schedule 2.16_
(the " _Continuing Capital Leases_ ") which shall remain in effect following
the Closing) will be fully repaid (the " _Repaid Indebtedness_ ") and that
such repayment will be funded with a portion of the Purchase Price. In order
to facilitate such repayment, no less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall obtain payoff letters for all Repaid
Indebtedness, which payoff letters shall indicate that such lenders have
agreed to release all Liens in respect of such Repaid Indebte  dness relating
to the assets and properties of Seller and the Subsidiaries (as applicable)
upon receipt of the amounts indicated in such payoff letters and otherwise
shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Seller hereby instructs
Buyer to make the payments referenced in such payoff letters on the Closing
Date in order to discharge the Repaid Indebtedness, such payments to made from
the funds otherwise payable to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_.

  

 2.18 _Credit for Continuing Capital Lease Obligations; Post-Closing Calculation of Indebtedness and Continuing Capital Leases_.

       

 

  |  

  (a) For each Continuing Capital Lease, Buyer shall
receive as a credit against the Purchase Price (including against the amount
payable to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ ), an amount, determined as of
the Closing Date, equal to the present value of all remaining payments due and
owing under such Continuing Capital Lease based on an

  
---|--- 
   

 22

  

   
        

 

  |  

 assumed interest rate of two point two percent (2.2%) (the " _Capital Lease
Amount_ "). Such credit shall be estimated for purposes of the payment of the
Purchase Price at Closing as set forth in this Section 2.18(a). At least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller, in good faith and in
consultation with Buyer, shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a detailed
estimate of the present value of all remaining payments due and owing under
the Continuing Capital Leases as of the Closing Date based upon an assumed
interest rate of 2.2% (the " _Estimated Capital Lease Amount_ "), and (ii) a
certificate from Seller to the effect that such calculation was determined in
good faith in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.18(a)_ and in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied. Promptly thereafter, and before the
Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shal  l review such calculation and shall use
good faith, reasonable efforts to resolve any concern or disagreement raised
by Buyer with respect to such calculation, and such calculation shall be
subject to Buyers acceptance (acting reasonably). The Estimated Capital Lease
Amount (as accepted by Buyer acting reasonably) shall be deducted from the
$106,000,000 payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_.

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (b) As promptly as practicable, but not later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the " _Verification Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers detailed
calculation of (i) the Capital Lease Amount and (ii) the total amount of
Indebtedness of Seller and the Subsidiaries (other than obligations under the
Continuing Capital Leases) as of the Closing Date (the combination of (i) and
(ii), the " _Buyer s Calculated Debt Amount_") together with a certificate
from Buyer to the effect that such calculation was determined in good faith in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.18(a)_ and this _Section 2.18(b)_
and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (c) If the Buyers Calculated Debt Amount, as
determined by Buyer, is less than the total amount of Repaid Indebtedness and
Estimated Capital Lease Amount determined pursuant to _Section 2.17 and
2.18(a)_ (the " _Estimated Total Indebtedness_ "), such amount determined by
Buyer shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. If the Buyers
Calculated Debt Amount, as determined by Buyer, is greater than the Estimated
Total Indebtedness, Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the date of its
receipt of Buyers Verification Statement to review Buyers calculation. Upon
completion of its review (and in any event within the required thirty (30)-day
period), Seller shall submit to Buyer a letter regarding Sellers concur 
rence or disagreement with the accuracy of Buyers calculation, with any
disagreement being specified with appropriate explanatory details. Sellers
disagreement may only be on the basis that Buyers calculation is not in
accordance with the provisions of the opening paragraph of this _Section 2.17
and 2.18_ or is mathematically incorrect. If Seller fails to deliver a letter
disagreeing with Buyers calculation within such thirty (30) day period,
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted Buyers calculation, in which event
Buyers calculation shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.
Following delivery of such letter of disagreement (if any), Seller and Buyer
shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
delivery of such letter) cause their respective Representatives to confer with
each other with a view to resolving such disagreement.

  
   

23

  

   
        

 

  |  

  (d) If Sellers and Buyers Representatives are
unable to resolve such disagreement within thirty (30) days after the date of
delivery of Sellers letter of disagreement (or longer, as mutually agreed by
the Parties), each of Seller and Buyer shall submit a position with respect to
the matter in dispute to a mutually acceptable firm of Independent Accountants
for review and final determination. The determination of the Independent
Accountants with respect to such disagreement shall be completed within thirty
(30) days after the appointment of the Independent Accountants and shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. The Independent Accountants
shall adopt the position of either Buyer or Seller based upon which position
more accurately ref  lects the aggregate of the Capital Lease Amount and the
total amount of Indebtedness of Seller and Subsidiaries (other than
obligations under the Continuing Capital Leases) as of the Closing Date (using
the total present value amount of payments determined in accordance with GAAP
(and using a discount rate of two point two percent (2.2%)) as the measure of
the present value of the obligations under the Continuing Capital Leases as of
the Closing Date). The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants
shall be paid by whichever of Seller or Buyer is the Party whose position
regarding the Capital Lease Amount and the total amount of Indebtedness of
Seller and Subsidiaries (other than obligations under the Continuing Capital
Leases) as of the Closing Date is not selected by the Independent Accountants
as the correct determination.

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (e) If the total of the Capital Lease Amount and
Indebtedness of Seller and the Subsidiaries (other than the Continuing Capital
Leases) as of the Closing Date is finally determined (whether by agreement of
the Parties, deemed acceptance by Seller (as provided in _Section 2.18(b)_ )
or determination by the Independent Accountants) to be:

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (i) less than the Estimated Total Indebtedness, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller, within five (5) Business Days after such
determination is made, payment of such difference by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds, and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be
adjusted accordingly; or

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (ii) greater than the Estimated Total Indebtedness,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer, within five (5) Business Days after such
determination is made, payment of such difference by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds, and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be
adjusted accordingly.

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) Each Employee Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. There are no pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened audits, investigations or claims involving any
Employee Plan by any Governmental Authority or other Person, other than
routine claims for benefits. Each Employee Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding its qualified status,
and no fact exists, including any amendment or failure to amend any Employee
Plan, that would cause the IRS to revoke such favorable determination letter.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (e) Except (i) as may be provided in any employment
Contract currently in effect between Seller or any Subsidiary and an Employee

time of payment or vesting, or increase the amo  unt of, or

414(n) of the Code) performs (or during the preceding three (3) years

the classification of employees and independent contractors. No Person engaged
by Seller or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor, Third Party contract
laborer, temporary employee, or "leased employee" has ever been improperly
excluded from participation in a Employee Plan, nor has Seller or any
Subsidiary used the services of any such individual to an extent that would
reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any of the
Employee Plans or the imposition of ma  terial penalties or excise taxes
with respect to the Employee Plans by the IRS, the Department of Labor, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or any other Governmental Authority.

  |  

  (i) Except as required by Applicable Law or as
described on _Schedule 3.28(i)_ , since January 1, 2004, there has been no
amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written)
by Seller, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that would
increase the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of the
expense incurred in respect thereof for the preceding twelve (12) months.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (j) Seller, any applicable Subsidiary and each ERISA
Affiliate have complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation coverage requirements of section 4980B of the Code and the
regulations thereunder with respect to each Employee Plan that is, or was
during any taxable year of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate for which the statute
of limitations on the assessment of federal income taxes remains open, by
consent or otherwise, a group health plan within the meaning of section
5000(b)(1) of the Code. Each Employee Plan is in compliance with the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations
issued thereunder.

  
   

 45

  

   
        

 

  |  

  (k) Neither the Employee Plans, any trusts created
thereunder, Seller, any applicable Subsidiary, nor any ERISA Affiliate, nor
any employee of the foregoing, nor, to Sellers Knowledge, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in section 4975 of the Code or section
406 of ERISA).

material employee fringe benefit plan presently maintained by, or contributed
to by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any employee of Seller
or any ERISA Affiliate, including any such plan required to be maintained or
contributed to by Applicable Law of the relevant jurisdiction, which would be
described in _Section 3.28(a)_ , but for the fact that such plans are
maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States (but excluding plans
maintained by a Governmental Authority, are listed on _Schedule 3.28(a)_ (the
" _Foreign Plans_ "), and a  true and complete copy of each written Foreign
Plan and of any description of each Foreign Plan that is not written has been

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (iii) each of the Foreign Plans has obtained from the
Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction with respect to such plan any
required determination that such plan is in compliance with Applicable Law;

  
   

 46

  

   
        

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (iv) each of the Foreign Plans has been administered
at all times, in all material respects, in accordance with its terms, and
there are no pending investigations by any Governmental Authority involving
the Foreign Plans, no claims pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened in
writing (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the
Foreign Plans) or Proceedings against any Foreign Plan or asserting any rights
or claims to benefits under any Foreign Plan which could give rise to any
material Liability, nor, are there any facts that could give rise to any
material Liability in the event of such investigation, claim, suit or
proceeding; and

contribution plan) under Buyers (or any Affiliates)  plans and programs.

disclosure obligation owed to either Party by any Person (including any other
Party); provided, further, that to the extent feasible, prior to disclosing
any such information to a Third Party pursuant to clause (i) or (iii) above,

required for its validity under the applicable law and shall be binding and
enforceable with respect to Seller and the Shareholders as so curtailed.

  
   

  6.13 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing,

  **ARTICLE 7** 
**_TAX MATTERS_**

 

  7.1 _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. Seller and Buyer
shall, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, close the taxable period of each
Subsidiary as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable Law
does not permit a Subsidiary to close its taxable year on the Closing Date or
in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period which
includes the Closing Date (but does not begin or end on that day) (a "
_Straddle Period Tax_ "), the Straddle Period Tax, if any, shall be allocated
(i) to the Seller for the period up to and including the close of business on
the Closing Date, and (ii) to Buyer for the period subsequent to the Closing
Date. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any
Straddle Period Tax shall be made by means of a closing  of the books and
records of such Subsidiary as of the close of the Closing Date, provided that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. The Party
required by Applicable Law to pay any Straddle Period Tax (the " _Paying
Party_ "), to the extent such payment exceeds the obligation of the Paying
Party hereunder, shall provide the other Party (the " _Non-Paying Party_ ")
with notice of payment, and within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice of
payment, the Non-Paying Party shall reimburse the Paying Party for the Non-
Paying Partys share of such Straddle Period Taxes. The Party required by
Applicable Law to file a Tax Return with respect to any Straddle Period Tax
shall do so within the time period prescribed  by Applicable Law.

  

 7.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

       

 

  |  

  (a) Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price
and any Assumed Seller Liabilities treated as consideration for Tax purposes
shall be allocated for Tax purposes among the Seller Assets and the Subsidiary
Shares and among the different items of assets of the QSSSs in the manner set
forth on an allocation statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") to be agreed
upon by Seller and Buyer before or as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date. The Allocation Statement shall be consistent with Code Section 1060 and,
to the extent applicable, Code Section 338, and the regulations thereunder,
and shall at a minimum provide for the following specific agreed-upon
allocations (the " _Firm Allocations_ "):

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (i) machinery, equipment, tools and vehicles: to be
determined by West, but not to exceed $30,500,000;

  
     



  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (ii) leasehold improvements: to be determined by West,
but not to exceed $10,000,000; and

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (iii) fixed assets and progress: to be determined by
West, but not to exceed $2,000,000.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (b) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to settle the Allocation Statement within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date. If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach an
agreement on the specific allocations to be included in the

  
   

60

  

   
        

 

  |  

 Allocation Statement (other than the Firm Allocations) within such sixty
(60)-day period, either Party may, by written notice to the other, require
that the contents of the Allocation Statement (other than the Firm
Allocations) be determined by a mutually acceptable firm of Independent
Accountants. Promptly after the giving of such notice by either of Seller or
Buyer and upon such Parties mutual agreement on the firm of Independent
Accountants, each of Seller and Buyer shall submit its proposed Allocation
Statement (which shall include the Firm Allocations) to the Independent
Accountants for review together with such supporting documents and information
as each such Party deems appropriate to support its position. The
determination of the Independent Accountants with respect to the Allocation
Statement shall be completed within thirty (30) days after the appointment of
the Independent Accountant  s and shall be final, binding and conclusive on
Seller and Buyer (provided that such determination includes the Firm
Allocations). The Independent Accountants shall adopt the position of either
Buyer or Seller based upon which Partys submission, in the determination of
the Independent Accountants, more accurately reflects the correct allocation
of the Purchase Price and any Assumed Seller Liabilities treated as
consideration for Tax purposes among the Seller Assets and the Subsidiary
Shares and among the different items of assets of the QSSSs. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be paid by whichever of
Seller or Buyer is the Party whose proposed Allocation Statement is not
selected by the Independent Accountants as the correct Allocation Statement.

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     



  |  

  (c) Following the Closing, if any item on the
Allocation Statement (as finally agreed upon by Seller and Buyer or as
selected by the Independent Accountants, as applicable) needs to be updated
under Applicable Law (including as a result of any Purchase Price adjustment),
Seller shall provide to Buyer a proposed revised copy of the Allocation
Statement (a " _Revised Statement_ "), which Revised Statement shall be
subject to Buyers review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If Seller and Buyer disagree on such Revised Statement and are
unable to resolve such disagreement within thirty (30) days after such Revised
Statement is provided by Seller to Buyer, such Parties shall resolve such
disagreement in accordance with the provisions  of _Section 7.2(b)_ , as if
such Revised Statement were the original Allocation Statement.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) Buyer and Seller shall allocate the Purchase
Price in accordance with the Allocation Statement (as finally agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer or as selected by the Independent Accountants, as applicable)
or, if applicable, the last Revised Statement provided by Buyer and either
approved by Seller or determined to be correct by the Independent Accountants
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ (as applicable). All Tax Returns and reports
filed by Buyer, Seller, and their respective Affiliates, including a Form
8883, shall be prepared consistently with such allocation, unless such
allocation (or any part thereof) is contrary to Applicable Law.

business hours, at no cost to Seller, to provide information and answer
questions to assist Seller in its preparation of such Tax Returns and other
tax-related filings. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. No
later than fourteen (14) days prior to the applicable filing deadline

Seller shall deliver to Buyer a draft copy of such Tax Return for Buyers
review and comment. Within seven (7) days after receip  t of such Tax
Return, Buyer shall deliver to Seller any comments of Buyer with respect to
such Tax Return. To the extent that Buyer raises any issue with the contents
of any such Tax Return, Seller and Buyer shall forthwith consult with each
other to resolve such issue. If necessary to provide additional time for the
achievement of such resolution, Seller will seek to obtain any available
extension for filing of such Tax Return. In no event shall Seller be obligated
to delay the filing of any Tax Return beyond any available extension period in
connection with efforts to resolve issues raised by Buyer with respect to any
such Tax Return. Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve on a
timely basis any such issue raised by Buyer. However, subject to its other
obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall have sole discretion in
determining the contents of any such Tax Return. Buyer agrees that, without

waiver of any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes, agree to or
compromise any Tax Liabilities or refunds, or take any other action, in
respect of income Taxes arising from any Subsidiary operations for taxable

comment. Within seven (7) days after receipt of such Tax Return, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer any comments of Seller with respect to such Tax Return. To
the extent that Seller raises any issue with the contents of any such Tax
Return, Seller and Buyer shall fo  rthwith consult with each other to
resolve such issue. If necessary to provide additional time for the
achievement of such resolution, Buyer will seek to obtain any available
extension for filing of such Tax Return. In no event shall Buyer be obligated
to delay the filing of any Tax Return beyond any available extension period in
connection with efforts to resolve issues raised by Seller with respect to any
such Tax Return. Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve on a
timely basis any such issue raised by Seller. However, subject to its other

  |  

  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Article 10_ , Seller shall have no Liability with respect to indemnification
claims under _Section 10.2(a)_ or _10.2(c)_ until the total of all Losses with
respect to such matters exceeds $750,000 in the aggregate (the " _Claims
Deductible_ "), and then Seller shall only be liable for claims under
_Sections 10.2(a)_ and _10.2(c)_ to the extent that the aggregate amount of
Losses underlying such claims exceeds the Claims Deductible. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Claims Deductible shall not apply to (i) any claim made
under _Section 10.2(a)_ in respect of any breach of representation or warranty
by Seller under _Section 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.4_ , _3.8_ , _3.18_ ,  _3.22_ (but
only to the extent such breach relates to Taxes), _3.29_ or _3.30_ or by any

(including payments from the Indemnity Escrow Amount) in respect of any and
all indemnification claims under _Sections 10.2(a)_ and _10.2(c)_ that, in the
aggregate, are equal to $20,000,000; provided, however that such limitation

any breach of representation or warranty by Seller under _Section 3.1_ , _3.2_
, _3.4_ , _3.8_ , _3.18_ , _3.22_ (but only to the extent such breach re 
lates to Taxes),  _3.29_ or _3.30_ or by any Shareholder under _Article 4_ ,
or (ii) any claim made under _Section_ _10.2(c)_ in respect of a breach of
covenant under _Article 2_.

  |  

 10.5 _Limitations on Buyer s Indemnity Obligations_.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (a) Buyer shall have no Liability with respect to
indemnification claims under _Section 10.3(a)_ or _10.3(c)_ until the total of

5.1_ , _5.2_ or _5.5_.

  
   

 69

  

   
        

 

  |  

  (b) Buyer shall have no Liability with respect to
indemnification claims under _Section 10.3(a)_ or _10.3(c)_ after it has made
payments to or on behalf of Seller Indemnified Persons in respect of any such
indemnification claims that, in the aggregate, are equal to $20,000,000;
provided, however that such limitation shall not apply to any claim made under
_Section 10.3(a)_ in respect of any breach of representation or warranty by
Buyer under _Section 5.1_ , _5.2_ or _5.5_.

 10.6 _Time Limitations_.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (a) For purposes of this Agreement, an Indemnified
Person may only assert a claim for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ or
_Section 10.3(a)_ (as applicable) during the applicable period of time (the "
_Claims Period_ ") specified as follows:

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (i) With respect to any indemnification claim arising
out of the breach by Seller or any Shareholder of any representation or
warranty contained in _Section 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.4_ , _3.8_ , _3.29_ or _3.30_
or _Article 4_ or the breach by Buyer of any representation or warranty
contained in _Section 5.1_ , _5.2_ or _5.5_ , the Claims Period shall commence
on the date of this Agreement and continue indefinitely.

  
     



  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (ii) With respect to any indemnification claim arising
out of the breach by Seller of any representation or warranty contained in
_Section 3.18_ or _3.22_ (but only to the extent such breach relates to
Taxes), the Claims Period shall commence on the date of this Agreement and
continue until the date which is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

  (iii) With respect to any other indemnification claim
arising out of the breach by Seller or Buyer of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement not referred to in _Section 10.6(a)(i)_ or
_10.6(a)(ii)_ , the Claims Period shall commence on the date of this Agreement
and continue until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (b) withstanding the provisions of _Section 10.6(a)_
, if before 5:00 p.m. (Arizona time) on the last day of the applicable Claims
Period, either Party against which an indemnification claim has been made
hereunder has been properly notified in writing of such claim for indemnity
under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ , and such claim has not been finally
resolved, settled or otherwise disposed of as of such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved, settled or otherwise disposed of in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  |  

 10.7 _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to
indemnity under _Section 10.2_ or _10.3_ (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of
notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified
Person shall give prompt written notice to the Party obligated to indemnify
under such Section (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of such
Third-Party Claim, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
subject matter of

  
   

 70

  

   
        

 

  |  

 the claim, the amount of the claim in question (to the extent known or
estimable by the Indemnified Person) and any other material or pertinent facts
regarding the claim (to the extent known by the Indemnified Person); provided,
however, that the failure by the Indemnified Person to provide such prompt
written notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Person, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate that the defense of
such Third-Party Claim has been prejudiced by the Indemnified Persons failure
to give such prompt written notice.

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 10.7(a)_ of the assertion of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim and, subject to _Section 10.7(c)_ , to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long as it reasonably
and diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person
under this _Article 10_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses
with respect to the defense of such Third-  Party Claim, in each case
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense
of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effectuated by the
Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Persons Consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (i) there is no finding or admission
of any violation of Applicable Law or of the rights of any Person, (ii) an
express condition thereof is the release of the Indemnified Person by each
Third Party claimant from all Liability with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, and (iii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of
the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not,
within fifteen (15) days after th  e Indemnified Persons notice is given,
give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled, to the
Indemnifying Partys exclusion and at the Indemnifying Partys cost, to fully
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall
be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise
or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person in respect thereof.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 10.7_ , the Indemnified Person may require that the Indemnifying
Party not assume or maintain control of, or actively participate in (in which
case, the Indemnifying Party shall not assume, maintain control of or actively
participate in) the defense of, any Third Party Claim against the Indemnified
Person if (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third-
Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that
joint representation of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Person would be
inappropriate, (ii) the Indemnified Person requests, and the Indemnifying
Party fails to provide (A) reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of
the Indemnifying Partys financi  al capacity and willingness to defend such
Third-Party Claim and to provide indemnification with respect thereto, and (B)
an acknowledgment to the

  
   

 71

  

   
        

 

  |  

 Indemnified Person of the Indemnifying Partys responsibility to provide
indemnification with respect thereto, or (iii) the Indemnified Person
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that the
Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates or Representatives
other than as a result of monetary damages for which it or they would be
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. In any of these events, the
Indemnified Person may, by written notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume
the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim,
but the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by any compromise or settlement
of such Third-Party Claim for the purposes of this Agreement without its prior
written consent to such compromise or settlement (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification under this _Article 10_ , (i) both the Indemnified Person and
the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully
informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings
at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel,
and (ii) the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to render to
each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to
cooperate reasonably and in good faith with each other in order to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification under this _Article 10_ , each Party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve
in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all confidential
information (including the Confidential Information) of the other Party and
the attorney-client and work-product privileges of the other Party. In
connection therewith, each Party agrees that (i) it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has
assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with Applicable Law and rules of procedure), and (ii)
all communications between either Party and counsel respons  ible for
or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent
possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privilege.

  
   

 10.8 _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by written notice to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the subject matter of the claim, the amount of the claim in question (to the extent known or estimable by the Indemnified Person) and any other material or pertinent facts regarding the claim (to the extent known by the Indemnified Person), and shall be paid promptly by the Indemnifying Party after such notice, together with satisfactory proof of Losses or other documents evidencing the basis of the Losses sought, are received by the Indemnifying Party.

 

  10.9 _Effect of Materiality_. For purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses to which the Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable) is entitled as a result of any
inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement or in
any agreement, certificate or instrument furnished or to be furnished pursuant
hereto or in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, such
representation or warranty shall not be deemed qualified by

 

 72

  

   
  

 any concept of "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar qualification.

 

  10.10 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Article 10_ shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

  10.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification rights
provided in this _Article 10_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available
to the Parties and the other Indemnified Persons for any and all Losses
related to a breach of any of the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements,
representations or warranties contained herein or in any of the Buyer Closing
Documents or the Seller Closing Documents, or any right, claim or action
arising from the Contemplated Transactions (and each Party hereby waives, to
the fullest extent that it may do so, any other right or remedy that may arise
under any Applicable Law); provided, however, that the provisions of this
_Section 10.9_ shall not preclude either Party from bringing an action for
specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy to req 
uire the other Party or any other applicable Person to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, the Buyer Closing Documents or the Seller
Closing Documents, and the provisions of this _Section 10.11_ shall not apply
in the case of fraud or willful misconduct.

  

 10.12 _Claims Against Indemnity Escrow Amount First_. A Buyer Indemnified Person must first make a claim for indemnification under _Section 10.2_ against the Indemnity Escrow Amount for the portion of the claim that does not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount then held in escrow and not otherwise claimed against before such Buyer Indemnified Person may make an indemnification claim directly against Seller. A Buyer Indemnified Person may make a claim for indemnification against Seller under _Section 10.2_ and demand direct payment from Seller in respect of such claim only to the extent that such claim exceeds any amounts remaining, and not otherwise claimed against, the Indemnity Escrow Amount. For avoidance of doubt, Buyer may at its sole option demand direct payment from Seller for any  claims by Buyer for amounts due pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_ ; Seller acknowledges that such claim is not subject to this _Article 10_.

 

  10.13 _Limitations on Environmental Condition
Indemnification_.

       

 

  |  

  (a) Buyer agrees that, in connection with any
indemnification claim against Seller under _Section 10.2(e)_ for Losses
incurred in connection with the Remediation of any of the environmental
conditions described on _Schedule 10.2(e),_ Seller shall only be liable to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Person for those Losses incurred to satisfy the
Remediation Standard.

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     



  |  

  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Remediation"
shall mean all actions required to (i) investigate, clean up, remove or treat
any Hazardous Material that is present or has been Released, (ii) restore or
reclaim the Environment with respect to such presence or Release(s), (iii)
perform required remedial investigations, feasibility studies, corrective
actions, closures and post-remedial or post-closure studies, investigations,
operations and maintenance and monitoring with respect to such presence or a
Release, and (iv) prepare and submit any reports, submissions or other
responses required to be provided to or filed with any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such

  
   

 73

  

   
        

 

  |  

 activities and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, respond to any
comments from any Governmental Authority in connection therewith.

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Remediation
Standard" shall be the standard which (i) complies with the minimum standards
under Applicable Law (including Environmental Laws) as in effect at the time
of the completion of the Remediation, (ii) is the minimum standard necessary
to obtain approval or authorization by all Governmental Authorities with
jurisdiction over such matters, where such approval or authorization is
required by applicable Environmental Laws, (iii) complies with the minimum
standards set forth in the applicable lease for the Leased Real Property, if
any, (iv) complies with any enforceable Order, Proceeding or Contract, and (v)
is necessary to resolve a Third-Party Claim for which a Buyer Indemnified
Person is liable.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) With respect to the Regulatory Compliance Matters
Table included on _Schedule 10.2(e)_ , Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to correct all noncompliance matters disclosed on such table within
one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date for such matters
which can reasonably be corrected within such one hundred and twenty (120)-day
period, and otherwise as soon as reasonably practicable, with Seller
indemnifying any Buyer Indemnified Person for all Losses incurred by such
Buyer Indemnified Person in connection with the making of such corrective
efforts, including any fines, penalties or other charges assessed against such
Buyer Indemnified Person in connection therewith. If Buyer fails to use such
commercially reasonable efforts to cor  rect any such noncompliance matter
disclosed on such table within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the
Closing Date or within such other reasonably practicable period, and the
Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Person as a result of such
noncompliance matter would have been a lesser amount but for Buyers failure
to use such commercially reasonable efforts to correct such noncompliance
matter within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date or
within such other reasonably practicable period, then Seller shall only be
required to indemnify Buyer for such lesser amount of Losses.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (e) Unless reasonably necessary to investigate,
uncover, disclose or undertake Remediation of an environmental condition that
is apparent or is reasonably believed or suspected by Buyer to exist on, under
or about any Seller/Subsidiary Property, or unless required by Applicable Law
(including Environmental Law), Order, Contract, a lease for any Leased Real
Property, or required or reasonably advisable to investigate and/or respond
to, or to correct, an imminent or substantial threat to human health or the
Environment, or as necessary for the construction, maintenance, repair or
modification of any Seller/Subsidiary Property; or as necessary or reasonably
requested by a bank, financial institution, underwriter, insurer or other
applicable Third Party in connection with financin  g or refinancing,
raising capital or issuing debt, obtaining insurance, or other similar bona
fide business purpose, Buyer shall not, nor shall it cause or permit any
Person within its control to, undertake any invasive sampling, testing,
investigation or analysis to uncover or disclose any environmental condition
on any Seller/Subsidiary Property.

  
   

74

  

   
  

  **ARTICLE 11** 
**_TERMINATION_**

 

  11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

       

 

  |  

  (a) by the written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (b) by Seller or Buyer, by written notice to the
other, if the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m. (Arizona time) on June 30,
2005, unless the failure to close is due to the failure of the notifying Party
to perform or comply with any of the covenants or obligations contained herein
to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing;

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (c) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if any of
Sellers conditions set forth in _Article 8_ has not been fulfilled, or if it
becomes incapable of fulfillment, by 5:00 p.m. (Arizona time) on June 30,
2005, unless, in either such case, such non-fulfillment is due to the failure
of Seller to perform or comply with any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein to be performed or complied with by Seller; or

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (d) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if any of
the conditions set forth in _Article 9_ has not been fulfilled, or if it
becomes incapable of fulfillment, by 5:00 p.m. (Arizona time) on June 30,
2005, unless such non-fulfillment is due to the failure of Buyer to perform or
comply with any of the covenants or agreements contained herein to be
performed or complied with by Buyer.

  
   

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing has failed to occur by June
30, 2005, and the sole reason for such failure is that Seller and Buyer are
waiting to receive from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corporation or
the Puerto Rico Secretary of State (or equivalent Governmental Authority) the
consent required pursuant to § 10108(a) of Title 13, Subtitle 15, Part II,
Chapter 905 of the Laws of Puerto Rico Annotated (or any other Applicable Law
related to such provision) in connection with the change of control of Tech
Group Puerto to occur at Closing (as such consent is referenced on item 2 of
_Schedule 3.3_ ), the dates referred to in Sections _11.1(b)_ , _(c)_ and
_(d)_ shall be extended for up to sixty (60) days to permit Seller and Buyer
additional time to obtain receipt of such consent.

 

  11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of _Section 11.1_ ,
this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, without any Liability to
any Person in respect hereof or of the Contemplated Transactions on the part
of either Party or any of its Representatives or Affiliates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the provisions of this _Section 11.2_ , _Section 11.3_ and
_Article 12_ , and the definitions herein applicable to any of such
provisions, shall survive such termination indefinitely or until the earlier
specified time referred to in such provision, and (ii) if the Closing does not
occur as a result of either Partys breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation hereunder, the termination of this  Agreement pursuant
to  _Section 11.1_ shall not relieve the breaching Party of any Liability for
such breach, and the non-breaching

  

75

  

   
  

 Party shall be entitled to all remedies against the breaching Party for such
breach, whether at law or in equity, even if the non-breaching Party is the
Party that terminated this Agreement.

 

  11.3 _Termination Fee_. If Buyer terminates this
Agreement prior to Closing based on Buyers decision to pursue another
acquisition of a company operating in a business substantially similar to the
Business with consideration (including assumption of debt and earn-out or
other similar deferred purchase price payments) of between $100 million and
$175 million, and Buyer enters into a definitive, binding acquisition or
merger agreement with a Third Party with respect to such other transaction
within ninety (90) days after Buyers delivery to Seller of written notice of
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall reimburse Seller up to $250,000 of
Sellers out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this
Agr  eement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Such
reimbursement shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after Buyers entry
into such definitive, binding acquisition agreement and shall constitute

  12.3 _Dispute Resolution_. Except for actions for
specific performance, injunction or other equity remedies contemplated in this
Agreement or in any Seller Closing Document or Buyer Closing Document, any
dispute or difference between the Parties arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions which the Parties are unable
to resolve themselves shall be submitted to and resolved by arbitration before
a single arbitrator, for amounts in dispute under $5,000,000 and otherwise
before a panel of three (3) arbitrators, pursuant to the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as supplemented or
modified by the provisions of this _Section 12.3_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, pursuant to _Section 2.16_ , Buyer or Seller elects to submit 
a dispute under any of  _Section 2.11(b)_ , _2.12(b)_ or _2.12(f)_ to
arbitration pursuant to this _Section 12.3_ , then such Party shall give
written notice to the other Party of such election. In such event, the three
(3)-member arbitration panel shall be selected by each of Buyer and Seller
selecting one arbitrator within thirty (30) days of such notice and the two
(2) arbitrators selecting a third (3rd) arbitrator by mutual agreement;
provided that if one Party does not select an arbitrator within the
aforementioned thirty (30)-day period, then the arbitrator selected by the
other Party shall be the sole arbitrator to consider and decide upon the
dispute in question. The arbitrator(s) shall consider the dispute at issue in
Phoenix, Arizona within one hundred twenty (120) days (or such other period as
may be acceptable to the Parties to the dispute) of the designation of the
arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall be bound to follow the laws of the St 
ate of Pennsylvania, decisional and statutory, in reaching any decision and
making any award and shall deliver a written award, including written findings
of fact and conclusions of law, with respect to the dispute to each of the
Parties, who shall promptly act in accordance therewith. Any award of the
arbitrator(s) shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties; provided,
however that either Party may seek the vacating, modification or correction of
the arbitrator(s) decision or

  

78

  

   
  

 award as provided under Section 10 and Section 11 of the Federal Arbitration
Act 9 U.S.C. §1-14. Either Party may enforce any award rendered pursuant to
the arbitration provisions of this _Section 12.3_ by bringing suit in any
court of competent jurisdiction. All costs and expenses attributable to the
arbitrator(s) shall be allocated between the Parties in such manner as the
arbitrator(s) determine to be appropriate under the circumstances; provided,
however that if any disagreement under _Section 2.11_ or _Section 2.12_ is
referred to arbitration under this _Section 12.3_ pursuant to _Section 2.16_ ,
all costs and expenses attributable to the arbitrator(s) shall be paid by the
Party against which the arbitrator(s) rule, consistent with the provisions of
_Sections 2.11_ and _2.12_. Either Party may file a copy of this _Section
12.3_ with any arbitrator or court as written evide  nce of the
knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this _Section 12.3_.

 

  12.4 _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. Except to the extent
provided by _Section 10.9_ , the rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder
are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by
either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement
or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege shall preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) no
claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred
to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole  or in part, by
a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless made in writing and
signed by the other Party, (ii) no waiver that may be given by a Party shall
be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (iii)
no notice to or demand on one Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of that Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  

 12.5 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement (including the Appendices, Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the other agreements and instruments to be executed and delivered by the Parties pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire and final agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, understandings, commitments, communications and representations made between the Parties, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that the confidentiality letter agreement dated November 24, 2004 between the Parties shall remain in full force and effect until the consummation of the Closing. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except by a written agreement  executed by the Parties.

 

  12.6 _Assignments; Successors; No Third-Party Rights_.
Neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate or cause to be assumed
any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may assign any of its rights and obligations hereunder in
whole or in part to any direct or indirect subsidiary of Buyer and may
collaterally assign its rights hereunder to any lender or financing source to
Buyer or its subsidiaries, in each case, without the consent of the Seller;
provided,

 

 79

  

   
  

 however, that no such assignment by Buyer shall relieve Buyer from any of
its obligations hereunder. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement
shall be construed to give any Person other than the Parties any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement, except (i) as provided under _Article 10_
with respect to the indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Persons and Seller
Indemnified Persons, and (ii) such rights as shall inure to a successor or
permitted assign pursuant to this _Section 12.6_.

  

 12.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, is held to be unenforceable or invalid by any Governmental Authority or arbitrator or under any Applicable Law, the Parties shall negotiate an equitable adjustment to the provisions of this Agreement with the view to effecting, to the greatest extent possible, the original purpose and intent of this Agreement. In any event, the invalidity of any provision of this Agreement or portion of a provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision of this Agreement or the remaining portion of the applicable provision.

 

  12.8 _Dates and Times_. Dates and times set forth in
this Agreement for the performance of the Parties respective obligations
hereunder or for the exercise of their rights hereunder shall be strictly
construed, time being of the essence of this Agreement. All provisions in this
Agreement which specify or provide a method to compute a number of days for
the performance, delivery, completion or observance by either Party of any
action, covenant, agreement, obligation or notice hereunder shall mean and
refer to calendar days, unless otherwise expressly provided. Except as
expressly provided herein, the time for performance of any obligation or
taking any action under this Agreement shall be deemed to expire at 5:00 p.m.
(Arizona time) on the last day of the applicable time period provided for
her  ein. If the date specified or computed under this Agreement for the
performance, delivery, completion or observance of a covenant, agreement,
obligation or notice by either Party, or for the occurrence of any event
provided for herein, is a day other than a Business Day, then the date for
such performance, delivery, completion, observance or occurrence shall
automatically be extended to the next Business Day following such date.

 

  12.9 _Governing Law_. Except as provided in _Section
12.3_ with respect to the application of specific provisions of the Federal
Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. §1-14, this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard
to conflicts-of-laws principles that would require the application of any
other law.

  

 12.10 _Execution of Agreement_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.
