                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"),  dated as of March 3,
2002,  by and among  GENERAL  GROWTH  PROPERTIES,  INC., a Delaware  corporation
("GGP"),  GGP  LIMITED   PARTNERSHIP,   a  Delaware  limited  partnership  ("GGP
Partnership"), GGP ACQUISITION, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and
a wholly-owned  subsidiary of GGP Partnership  ("Acquisition"),  GGP ACQUISITION
II, L.L.C., a Maryland limited liability  company and a wholly-owned  subsidiary
of GGP  Partnership  ("Partnership  Acquisition"),  JP REALTY,  INC., a Maryland
corporation  ("JP"),  and PRICE  DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY,  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP,  a
Maryland limited partnership ("PDC LP").


                                    RECITALS:

     A. The Board of  Directors  of GGP and the Board of Directors of JP deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective  stockholders,  upon the
terms and subject to the conditions  contained herein,  that JP shall merge with
and into Acquisition (the "Merger"),  with each issued and outstanding  share of
JP Common Stock and Price Group Stock,  each as defined herein,  to be converted
into the right to receive $26.10 in cash without interest.

     B. GGP Partnership, as the sole member of Partnership Acquisition,  and JP,
as the  sole  general  partner  of PDC LP,  deem it  advisable  and in the  best
interests of their respective  member and limited  partners,  upon the terms and
subject to the  conditions  contained  herein,  that,  immediately  prior to the
Merger,   Partnership  Acquisition  shall  merge  with  and  into  PDC  LP  (the
"Partnership  Merger"),  with the  holders  of PDC  Common OP Units (as  defined
herein) in PDC LP at the time of the  Partnership  Merger  receiving  (except as
otherwise  provided  herein) GGP Series B Preferred OP Units (as defined herein)
(such holders being the "Contributing  Holders of PDC Common OP Units"),  as set
forth herein,  or $26.10 cash without  interest (such holders being the "Selling
Holders of PDC Common OP Units").

     C.  Upon  the  terms  and  subject  to the  conditions  set  forth  herein,
Acquisition and JP shall execute  Articles of Merger (the "Maryland  Articles of
Merger") in  substantially  the form attached hereto as Exhibit A and shall file
such Maryland  Articles of Merger in accordance  with Maryland law to effectuate
the Merger.

     D.  Upon  the  terms  and  subject  to the  conditions  set  forth  herein,
Acquisition  and JP  shall  execute  a  Certificate  of  Merger  (the  "Delaware
Certificate of Merger") in  substantially  the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
and, concurrently with the filing of the Maryland Articles of Merger, shall file
such  Delaware  Certificate  of  Merger  in  accordance  with  Delaware  law  to
effectuate the Merger.

     E.  Upon  the  terms  and  subject  to the  conditions  set  forth  herein,
immediately  prior  to the  Merger,  PDC LP and  Partnership  Acquisition  shall
execute  Articles of Merger (the "Maryland  Articles of Partnership  Merger") in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and shall file such Maryland
Articles of Partnership Merger in accordance with Maryland law to effectuate the
Partnership Merger.

     F. JP has received a fairness opinion  relating to the Merger  contemplated
hereby as more fully described herein.

     G. For federal income tax purposes,  it is intended that the Merger will be
treated  as a  taxable  sale  of  assets  by JP in  exchange  for  cash  and the
assumption of liabilities and a distribution of such cash to the JP stockholders
in liquidation of JP.

<PAGE>

     H. For federal  income tax purposes,  it is intended  that the  Partnership
Merger,  regardless  of form,  be  treated  as a  tax-free  contribution  by the
Contributing  Holders of PDC Common OP Units of their PDC Common OP Units to GGP
Partnership  in exchange for GGP Series B Preferred OP Units,  under Section 721
of the Code,  and a sale by the Selling  Holders of PDC Common OP Units of their
PDC Common OP Units to GGP Partnership in exchange for cash.

     I. GGP, GGP Partnership,  Acquisition,  Partnership Acquisition, JP and PDC
LP  desire  to  make  certain  representations,  warranties  and  agreements  in
connection  with  the  Merger  and the  Partnership  Merger  (collectively,  the
"Mergers").

     J.  As an  inducement  to GGP  and  GGP  Partnership  to  enter  into  this
Agreement, certain stockholders of JP and certain holders of PDC Common OP Units
have entered into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement"),  in substantially
the form  attached  hereto as Exhibit D,  pursuant to which each such Person (as
defined herein) has agreed,  among other things, to vote his or its shares of JP
Common  Stock,  Price  Group  Stock  and PDC  Common  OP  Units to  approve,  as
applicable,  this  Agreement,  the  Mergers,  the PDC LP  Amendment  (as defined
herein) and any other matter which  requires his or its vote in connection  with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     NOW,   THEREFORE,   in   consideration  of  the  premises  and  the  mutual
representations,  warranties,  covenants and agreements  contained  herein,  the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE 1.

without  any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital  stock or
limited liability company interests of JP or Acquisition:

     (a)  Ownership  Interests  of  Acquisition.   The  issued  and  outstanding
ownership interests in Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain  outstanding  as the issued and  outstanding  ownership  interests of the

share of JP Common Stock,  Price Group Stock,  JP Series A Preferred  Stock,  JP

Preferred  Stock")  that is owned  by JP,  as  treasury  stock,  or by GGP,  GGP
Partnership,  Acquisition or Partnership  Acquisition  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time shall  automatically  be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

     (c) Merger  Consideration.  The  consideration to be paid to the holders of
capital stock of JP in the Merger (collectively,  the "Merger Consideration") is
as follows:

          (i) Each share of JP Common  Stock and Price  Group  Stock  issued and

     be canceled in accordance with Section 1.7(b)), shall be converted into the
     right to receive $26.10 in cash without interest.

          (ii) Each share,  if any, of JP Series A Preferred  Stock, JP Series B
     Preferred  Stock and JP Series C  Preferred  Stock  issued and  outstanding
     immediately  prior to the Effective


                                       3
<PAGE>

     Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance  with Section  1.7(b))
     shall be converted  into the right to receive  0.025 shares of GGP Series D
     Preferred Stock, $100 par value per share ("GGP Series D Preferred Stock"),
     GGP  Series E  Preferred  Stock,  $100 par value per share  ("GGP  Series E
     Preferred  Stock")  and GGP Series F  Preferred  Stock,  $100 par value per
     share ("GGP Series F Preferred Stock"), respectively. Prior to or as of the
     Effective  Time,  the GGP Charter shall be amended in  accordance  with the
     Delaware  General  Corporation  Law,  as amended  (the  "DGCL") in order to
     create the GGP Series D Preferred  Stock,  GGP Series E Preferred Stock and
     the  GGP  Series  F  Preferred  Stock,  each  series  of  which  will  have
     substantially the same terms and rights as the JP Series A Preferred Stock,
     JP Series B Preferred Stock and JP Series C Preferred Stock,  respectively,
     including  with  respect to  distribution,  voting  rights and rights  upon
     liquidation, dissolution or winding-up.

          (iii) Each share, if any, of Excess Stock (as defined herein) which is
     not  redeemed  by JP prior to the  Effective  Time and  remains  issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
     the right to receive $26.10 in cash without interest.

          (iv) At the  Effective  Time  all  such  shares  shall  no  longer  be
     outstanding and shall  automatically  be canceled and shall cease to exist,
     and each holder of a certificate  that  immediately  prior to the Effective
     Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate"), shall cease to have any
     rights with  respect  thereto,  except the right to receive the  applicable
     Merger Consideration  described above and any dividends declared and unpaid
     thereon  payable to holders of record thereof as of a record date preceding
     the  Effective  Time.  Following  the  Effective  Time,  upon  surrender of
     Certificates  representing  shares of JP Common Stock, Price Group Stock or
     JP Preferred  Stock in accordance  with Section 1.8, the Surviving  Company
     shall pay to the holders of such  Certificates as of the Effective Time any
     unpaid  dividends  declared  in respect of the JP Common  Stock,  the Price
     Group  Stock  and JP  Preferred  Stock  with a  record  date  prior  to the
     Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

     (d) Stock Options.  Each JP Stock Option  outstanding  immediately prior to
the  Effective  Time  (whether  vested or  unvested)  shall be  converted at the
Effective  Time into the  right to  receive  an amount of cash  equal to (i) the
excess,  if any,  of $26.10  over the  exercise  price of such JP Stock  Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of JP Common Stock subject thereto which
have not theretofore been exercised.

     (e) No Appraisal Rights.  The holders of JP Common Stock, Price Group Stock
and JP  Preferred  Stock are not entitled  under  applicable  law to  appraisal,
dissenters' or similar rights as a result of the Mergers.

     (f) Adjustments to Merger  Consideration.  The Merger Consideration payable
upon the conversion of JP Common Stock, Price Group Stock or JP Preferred Stock,
as   applicable,   shall  be  adjusted  to  reflect  fully  the  effect  of  any
reclassification,  combination,  subdivision,  stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any stock dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into JP Common Stock,  Price Group Stock or JP Preferred  Stock, as applicable),
reorganization,  recapitalization or other like change with respect to JP Common
Stock, Price Group Stock or JP Preferred Stock, as applicable, occurring (or for
which a record  date is  established)  after  the date  hereof  and prior to the
Effective Time.

     1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Paying Agent.  Prior to the Effective  Time, GGP shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably  acceptable to JP to act as agent for the payment of
the Merger Consideration upon


                                       4
<PAGE>

surrender of Certificates  evidencing JP Common Stock and Price Group Stock (the
"Paying Agent").  GGP shall take all steps necessary to enable, and shall cause,
the Surviving Company to provide to the Paying Agent  immediately  following the
Effective Time the Merger  Consideration  issuable in exchange for the shares of
JP Common  Stock and Price Group  Stock  pursuant  to Section  1.7(c),  plus any
amounts  payable in respect of unpaid  dividends  declared  in respect of the JP
Common  Stock and Price Group  Stock with a record  date prior to the  Effective
Time and which remain unpaid at the  Effective  Time (such  consideration  being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

     (b)  Exchange  Procedure.  As  soon as  reasonably  practicable  after  the
Effective  Time,  the  Paying  Agent  shall  mail to each  holder of record of a
Certificate  (i) a form of letter  of  transmittal  (which  shall  specify  that
delivery shall be effected,  and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held
by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the  Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in customary  form and have such other  provisions  as
GGP may  reasonably  specify) and (ii)  instructions  for use in  effecting  the
surrender of the  Certificates  in exchange for the Merger  Consideration.  Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or  agents  as may be  appointed  by GGP,  together  with  such  letter of
transmittal,  duly completed and validly  executed,  and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,  the holder of such  Certificate
shall be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  therefor  the  applicable  Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares formerly  represented by such Certificate
pursuant to Section 1.7(c),  and the Certificate so surrendered  shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of JP Common Stock or Price
Group Stock that is not  registered in the stock  transfer  books of JP, payment
may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the  Certificate  so surrendered is  registered,  if such  Certificate  shall be
properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer,  and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment to a Person other than the registered  holder of such Certificate
or  establish to the  satisfaction  of GGP that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.   No  interest   shall  be  paid  or  shall  accrue  on  the  Merger
Consideration, or unpaid dividends declared in respect of the JP Common Stock or
Price  Group  Stock  with a record  date prior to the  Effective  Time and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

     (c) No Further  Ownership  Rights.  All cash and  securities  paid upon the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance  with the terms of this Article I shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of JP Common  Stock or Price Group  Stock  formerly  represented  by such
Certificate.  At the close of  business on the day on which the  Effective  Time
occurs the stock  transfer  books of JP shall be closed,  and there  shall be no
further  registration  of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company  of the  shares  of JP  Common  Stock or Price  Group  Stock  that  were
outstanding,  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time. If, after the Effective
Time,  Certificates  are presented to the Surviving  Company or the Paying Agent
for  transfer or any other  reason,  they shall be  canceled  and  exchanged  as
provided in this Article I.

     (d)  Record  Dates for  Final  Dividends;  Distributions  with  Respect  to
Unexchanged Shares.

          (i) If and to the extent  necessary for JP to satisfy the requirements
     of Section  857(a)(1) of the Code (as defined  herein) for the taxable year
     of JP ending at the Effective  Time of the Merger (and to avoid the payment
     of any tax with respect to undistributed  income or gain), JP shall declare
     a  dividend  (the  "Final JP  Dividend")  to holders of shares of JP Common
     Stock and Price  Group  Stock,  if and to the extent  required by the terms
     thereof  the record  date for which  shall be the close of  business on the
     last business day prior to the Effective  Time of the Merger,  in an amount
     equal to the  minimum  dividend  sufficient  to permit JP to  satisfy  such
     requirements. Any dividends payable hereunder to holders of JP Common Stock
     or


                                       5
<PAGE>

     Price  Group  Stock  shall be paid on the  last  business  day  immediately
     preceding  the Closing  Date. In the event that JP is required to declare a
     Final JP Dividend  with  respect to the JP Common  Stock and/or Price Group
     Stock, PDC LP shall  simultaneously  declare a distribution (the "Final PDC
     LP  Distribution") to holders of PDC OP Units in an amount per JP Common OP
     Unit  equal to the Final JP  Dividend  payable  on each  share of JP Common
     Stock.  The record  date for the  payment of the Final PDC LP  Distribution
     shall  be the  close of  business  on the last  business  day  prior to the
     Effective  Time  of  the  Partnership  Merger.  The  distribution   payable
     hereunder  to  holders  of PDC  Common  OP Units  shall be paid on the last
     business day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

          (ii) If JP  determines  that it is  necessary  to declare the Final JP
     Dividend, JP shall notify GGP at least 20 days prior to the date for the JP
     Stockholders Meeting.

     (e)  Termination  of Exchange  Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains  undistributed  to the holders of JP Common  Stock and Price Group Stock
for one year  after the  Effective  Time  shall be  delivered  to the  Surviving
Company, upon demand, and any holder of JP Common Stock or Price Group Stock who
has not theretofore  complied with this Article I shall  thereafter look only to
the Surviving Company for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

     (f) No Liability.  None of GGP, GGP Partnership,  the Surviving  Company or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash  delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,  escheat, or
similar law. If any Certificates  shall not have been surrendered prior to three
years after the  Effective  Time (or  immediately  prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity(as defined herein)), any such Merger Consideration in
respect  thereof shall,  to the extent  permitted by applicable  law, become the
property of the Surviving  Company,  free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

     (g)  Investment  of Exchange  Fund.  The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange  Fund, as directed by GGP, on a daily basis;  provided,
however,  that such investments  shall be in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by
the  United  States of  America  and  backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America,  (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc. or  Standard & Poor's  Corporation,
respectively,  (iii)  certificates  of deposit  maturing  not more than 180 days
after  the date of  purchase  issued by a bank  organized  under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof  having a combined  capital and surplus of at
least  $500,000,000  or (iv) a money  market  fund  having  assets  of at  least
$3,000,000,000.  Any interest and other income  resulting from such  investments
shall be paid to GGP Partnership.

     (h) Lost  Certificates.  If any Certificate  shall have been lost,  stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming  such  Certificate  to be lost,  stolen,  defaced or destroyed  and, if
required by the Surviving Company,  the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable  amount as the Surviving  Company may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such  Certificate,  the Paying
Agent  shall  pay  in  respect  of  such  lost,  stolen,  defaced  or  destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration.

     (i) Withholding Rights. GGP, GGP Partnership,  the Surviving Company or the
Paying Agent,  as applicable,  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise  payable  pursuant to this  Agreement  to any holder of
shares of JP Common Stock, Price Group Stock and JP Preferred Stock such amounts
as it is required to withhold  with respect to such  payments  under the Code or
any other provision of state, local or foreign tax law.


                                       6
<PAGE>

     (j) JP Preferred  Stock. In the event that any Shares of JP Preferred Stock
are  outstanding  prior to the  Effective  Time of the Merger,  GGP and JP shall
mutually agree upon and establish procedures to be applicable to the exchange of
certificates   evidencing  JP  Preferred   Stock  for  the   applicable   Merger
Consideration.

     1.9  Conversion of Equity  Securities  in the  Partnership  Merger.  At the
Effective  Time, by virtue of the  Partnership  Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of  partnership  interests or limited  liability  company
interests of PDC LP or Partnership Acquisition:

     (a)  Ownership  Interests  of  Partnership  Acquisition.   The  issued  and
outstanding ownership interests in Partnership  Acquisition immediately prior to
the  Effective  Time shall be  converted  into the number of PDC Common OP Units
held by holders of PDC Common OP Units other than JP as of such time.

     (b)  Partnership  Merger  Consideration.  The  consideration  to be paid to
holders  of  partnership   interests  in  PDC  LP  in  the  Partnership   Merger
(collectively, the "Partnership Merger Consideration") is as follows:

          (i)  Each JP  Common  OP Unit  outstanding  immediately  prior  to the
     Effective  Time of the  Partnership  Merger (other than PDC Common OP Units
     held by JP) shall be  exchanged  for  $26.10  per JP Common OP Unit in cash
     without interest,  provided that if the holder of a JP Common OP Unit is an
     "accredited  investor"  (as  defined  in Rule  501,  promulgated  under the
     Securities Act (as defined herein)),  and submits to GGP Partnership a Form
     of Election (as defined  herein) in accordance with the procedures and time
     periods  specified  in Section  5.1(c)  hereof,  such holder shall have the
     right to  receive  for each JP  Common  OP Unit  then  held by it .522 8.5%
     Series  B  Cumulative   Preferred  Units  of  limited  partnership  of  GGP
     Partnership (the "GGP Series B Preferred OP Units").

          (ii)  Prior  to or as of  the  Effective  Time,  the  GGP  Partnership
     Agreement shall be amended by the adoption of an amendment in substantially
     the form attached hereto as Exhibit E providing for the creation of the GGP
     Series B Preferred  OP Units.  The holders of the GGP Series B Preferred OP
     Units issued in the Partnership  Merger shall be entitled to the redemption
     rights provided for in the redemption  rights  agreement,  substantially in
     the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "GGP Series B Preferred OP Units
     Redemption  Agreement")  or, if they convert such GGP Series B Preferred OP
     Units into GGP Common OP Units  pursuant to the GGP  Partnership  Agreement
     amendment  described  above,  the  redemption  rights  provided  for in the
     redemption rights  agreement,  substantially in the form attached hereto as
     Exhibit G (the "GGP Common OP Units Redemption Agreement"). Pursuant to the
     terms of the GGP Series B Preferred OP Units Redemption Agreement, each GGP
     Series B Preferred OP Unit will be redeemable by the holder  thereof,  for,
     at the option of GGP, cash or 0.025 shares of GGP Series C Preferred Stock,
     $100 par value per share ("GGP Series C Preferred  Stock").  Prior to or as
     of the Effective  Time, the GGP Charter shall be amended in accordance with
     the DGCL by the adoption by the Board of Directors of GGP of a  Certificate
     of Designations,  in substantially the form of Exhibit H hereto,  providing
     for the creation of the GGP Series C Preferred Stock.

          (iii) Holders of PDC Common OP Units may elect to receive GGP Series B
     Preferred Units in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1(c) hereof.
     If a holder of PDC Common OP Units fails to comply with the  provisions  of
     Section  5.1(c)  hereof  with  respect  to some or all of its PDC Common OP
     Units,  such holder shall receive cash pursuant to this Section 1.9(b) upon
     the  conversion  of such PDC Common OP Units into GGP Series B Preferred OP
     Units in the Partnership Merger.

<PAGE>

          (iv)  The PDC  Series  A OP  Units  (as  defined  herein)  outstanding
     immediately  prior to the Effective  Time of the  Partnership  Merger shall
     remain outstanding,  except that, immediately following the Effective Time,
     each such Series A OP Unit,  shall, in accordance with the terms of the PDC
     LP Agreement,  become exchangeable into the right to receive .025 shares of
     GGP Series D Preferred Stock.

          (v)  The  PDC  Series  B OP  Units  (as  defined  herein)  outstanding

     LP Agreement,  become exchangeable into the right to receive .025 shares of
     GGP Series F Preferred Stock.

          (vii) Any PDC OP Units (as defined herein)  outstanding and held by JP
     immediately  prior to the Effective  Time of the  Partnership  Merger shall
     remain outstanding.

          (viii) At the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, each holder of
     a JP Common OP Unit  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time
     shall cease to have any rights  with  respect  thereto  except the right to
     receive the applicable Partnership Merger Consideration described above and
     any  dividends  declared  and unpaid  thereon  payable to holders of record
     thereof as of a record date  preceding  the Effective  Time.  Following the
     Effective  Time,  upon  delivery to the Paying Agent of such duly  executed
     documents,  including a Form of Election,  as may be required by the Paying
     Agent or GGP  Partnership,  the  Surviving  Partnership  shall  pay to such

Consideration   shall  be   adjusted   to  reflect   fully  the  effect  of  any
reclassification,  combination,  subdivision, split, reverse split, distribution
of   securities   convertible   into  PDC   Common  OP  Units,   reorganization,
recapitalization  or other  like  change  with  respect  to PDC  Common OP Units

                                   ARTICLE 2

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF JP

     Except as set forth in the JP SEC Documents  (as defined  herein) or in the
letter of even date herewith signed by the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer
or the President and Chief Operating  Officer of JP and delivered to GGP and GGP
Partnership prior to the execution hereof (the "JP Disclosure  Letter"),  JP and
PDC LP jointly and  severally  represent  and warrant to GGP,  GGP  Partnership,
Acquisition and Partnership Acquisition as follows:

     2.1  Organization,  Standing and Power.  JP has been duly  organized and is
validly  existing and in good standing  under the laws of the State of Maryland.
JP has all requisite  corporate power and authority to own,  operate,  lease and
encumber its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted. The JP
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,  as amended (the "JP Articles"),
are  in  effect,  and  no  dissolution,  revocation  or  forfeiture  proceedings
regarding  JP have  been  commenced.  JP is duly  qualified  or  licensed  to do
business as a foreign  corporation and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction
in  which  the  nature  of its  business  or the  ownership  or  leasing  of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing  necessary,  other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,  individually or
in the  aggregate,  would  not have a JP  Material  Adverse  Effect  (as  herein
defined).  As used in this Agreement,  a "JP Material  Adverse Effect" means any
circumstance,  event, occurrence, change or effect that is materially adverse to
the business,  properties, assets (tangible or intangible),  financial condition
or results of  operations  of JP and PDC LP, taken as a whole,  except,  in each
case, as a result of (i) changes in general  economic  conditions  nationally or
regionally,  (ii) changes affecting the real estate industry  generally which do
not  affect  JP or PDC LP,  as the  case may be,  materially  disproportionately
relative to other participants in the real estate industry  similarly  situated,
or (iii) in and of itself and  without the  occurrence  of any other JP Material
Adverse  Effect,  changes  in the  trading  prices  of JP Common  Stock.  JP has
delivered to GGP and GGP Partnership true, complete and correct copies of the JP
Articles and JP's Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (the "JP Bylaws"),  in
each case, as amended or supplemented to the date of this Agreement.

     2.2 JP Subsidiaries.

     (a) Schedule 2.2 to the JP Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) each Subsidiary

transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement or otherwise  prevent JP or PDC LP
from performing their  obligations  under this Agreement in any material respect
or  reasonably  be  expected to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a JP
Material Adverse Effect.

     2.6 SEC Documents;  Financial Statements;  Undisclosed Liabilities. Each of
JP and PDC LP has filed all required reports,  schedules,  forms, statements and
other  documents  with the SEC since  January 1, 1997  through  the date  hereof
(collectively,  the "JP SEC  Documents").  Schedule  2.6(a) to the JP Disclosure
Letter contains a true,  complete and correct list of all JP SEC Documents filed
by JP or PDC LP with the SEC  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as
amended  (the  "Exchange  Act"),  between  January  1, 1997 and the date of this
Agreement.  All of the JP SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as of
their  respective  filing  dates,  complied in all  material  respects  with all
applicable  requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, in each
case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such JP SEC
Documents.  None of the JP SEC  Documents  at the time of filing  contained  any
untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omitted  to state any  material  fact
required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading,  except  to  the  extent  such  statements  have  been  modified  or
superseded by later JP SEC Documents  filed and publicly  available prior to the
date of this Agreement.  The consolidated financial statements of JP and PDC LP,
respectively,  included  in the JP SEC  Documents  complied  as to  form  in all
material  respects with  applicable  accounting  requirements  and the published
rules and  regulations  of the SEC with respect  thereto,  have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP") (except, in
the case of  unaudited  statements,  as permitted  by the  applicable  rules and
regulations  of the SEC)  applied  on a  consistent  basis  during  the  periods
involved  (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented
in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP
and the applicable rules and


                                       13
<PAGE>


regulations of the SEC, the consolidated  financial  position of (a) in the case
of JP, JP and the consolidated JP Subsidiaries  taken as a whole, and (b) in the
case of PDC LP, PDC LP and its consolidated JP Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in
each case, as of the dates thereof,  and the consolidated  results of operations
and cash flows for the periods  then ended  (subject,  in the case of  unaudited
statements,  to  normal  year-end  audit  adjustments).  Except  as set forth in
Schedule 2.6(b) to the JP Disclosure  Letter,  JP has no Subsidiaries  which are
not consolidated for accounting purposes. Except for liabilities and obligations
set forth in the JP SEC  Documents  or in Schedule  2.6(c) to the JP  Disclosure
Letter or incurred by JP or any JP Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business
since December 31, 2001,  none of JP or any JP Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued,  absolute,  contingent or otherwise)
required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of JP or in the
notes  thereto  and which,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would have a JP
Material Adverse Effect.

     2.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the JP SEC
Documents or in Schedule 2.7 to the JP Disclosure Letter,  since the date of the
most recent audited financial  statements  included in the JP SEC Documents (the
"JP Financial  Statement Date"), JP and the JP Subsidiaries have conducted their
business  only in the ordinary  course  (taking into  account  prior  practices,
including  the  acquisition  and  disposition  of  properties  and  issuance  of
securities) and there has not been (a) a JP Material  Adverse Effect through the
date hereof,  (b) except for regular  quarterly  distributions  not in excess of
$0.51  per share of JP Common  Stock or JP Common OP Unit,  $0.408  per share of
Price Group Stock,  $0.546875 per JP Series A OP Unit, $0.559375 per JP Series B
OP Unit and $0.546875 per JP Series C OP Unit (or, in each case, with respect to
the  period  commencing  on the date  hereof  and  ending on the  Closing  Date,
distributions as necessary to maintain REIT (as defined herein) status), in each
case,  with  customary  record and payment dates  (subject to Section 5.9),  any
authorization,  declaration,  setting  aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution  (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to the JP Common
Stock,  Price Group Stock or the PDC OP Units or any other equity security of JP
or PDC LP,  (c) any  split,  combination  or  reclassification  of the JP Common
Stock,  the  Price  Group  Stock  or the PDC OP  Units  or any  issuance  or the
authorization  of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of
or in substitution  for, or giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise,
shares of stock of JP or partnership  interests in PDC LP, or any issuance of an
ownership  interest in any other JP Subsidiary,  (d) any damage,  destruction or
loss  through  the date  hereof,  whether  or not  covered by  insurance,  that,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  has or  would  have a JP  Material  Adverse
Effect, (e) any change in accounting  methods,  principles or practices by JP or
any JP  Subsidiary  materially  affecting its assets,  liabilities  or business,
except  insofar as may have been  disclosed in JP SEC Documents or required by a
change in GAAP, or (f) except as expressly  contemplated by this Agreement,  any
amendment  of any  employment,  consulting,  severance,  retention  or any other
agreement between JP or any JP Subsidiary and any of their respective  officers,
directors or managers.

     2.8 Litigation.  Except as disclosed in the JP SEC Documents or in Schedule
2.8 to the JP  Disclosure  Letter,  and other  than  personal  injury  and other
routine tort litigation arising from the ordinary course of operations of JP and
the JP  Subsidiaries  (a) which are covered by adequate  insurance  subject to a
reasonable deductible or retention limit or (b) for which all material costs and
liabilities   arising  therefrom  are  reimbursable   pursuant  to  common  area
maintenance  or  similar  agreements,  there is no suit,  action  or  proceeding
pending (in which service of process has been received by an employee of JP or a
JP Subsidiary) or, to the Knowledge of JP, threatened against or affecting JP or
any JP Subsidiary  that,  individually or in the aggregate,  would reasonably be
expected  to  (i)  have  a JP  Material  Adverse  Effect  or  (ii)  prevent  the
consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  nor is
there  any  judgment,  decree,  injunction,  rule  or  order  of  any  court  or
Governmental  Entity or  arbitrator  outstanding  against JP, any JP  Subsidiary
having,  or which,  insofar as reasonably  can be foreseen,  in the future would
reasonably be expected to have, any such effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no claim has been made under any  directors' and officers'  liability  insurance
policy maintained at any time by JP or any of the JP Subsidiaries.

     2.9 Properties.

     (a) Except as provided in Schedule 2.2 to the JP Disclosure  Letter,  JP or
the JP Subsidiary set forth on Schedule 2.2 to the JP Disclosure Letter owns fee
simple  title to or holds a leasehold  interest  in each of the real  properties
identified  in Schedule 2.2 to the JP Disclosure  Letter (the "JP  Properties"),
which are all of the real estate  properties owned by them, in each case (except
for the Permitted  Title  Exceptions (as defined herein) free and clear of Liens

Disclosure Letter further identifies which of the JP Properties are owned in fee
simple by JP or a JP Subsidiary, and which of the JP Properties are subject to a
ground lease.  Except as set forth in Schedule 2.2 to the JP Disclosure  Letter,
no other Person has any ownership interest in any of the JP Properties,  and any
such ownership  interest so scheduled does not materially detract from the value
of the JP Subsidiary's interest in, or materially interfere with the present use
of, any of the JP Properties subject thereto or affected thereby.  Except as set
forth in Schedule 2.9(a) to the JP Disclosure Letter,  none of the JP Properties
is  subject  to any  restriction  on  the  sale  or  other  disposition  thereof
(including,  without limitation, rights of first refusal) or on the financing or
release of financing thereon. The JP Properties are not subject to any rights of
way, written agreements,  laws,  ordinances and regulations  affecting building,
development,  use  or  occupancy,  or  reservations  of  an  interest  in  title

following  (collectively,   the  "Permitted  Title  Exceptions"):  (i)  Property
Restrictions  and Encumbrances set forth in Schedule 2.9(a) to the JP Disclosure

of JP, are not violated by the current use of the Properties, (iii) the JP Space
Leases, the Ground Leases, other leases and the REAs, (iv) Property Restrictions
and  Encumbrances  disclosed on the Existing Title Policies (as defined herein),
the title  reports  listed in  Schedule  2.9(a) to the JP  Disclosure  Letter or
existing  surveys (true,  complete and correct copies of which surveys have been
delivered to GGP and GGP Partnership) (provided, however, that ground leases and
mortgage   indebtedness   shall  not  be  Permitted  Title   Exceptions   unless
specifically  noted on  Schedules  2.9(f)  and  2.5(b)(i)  to the JP  Disclosure
Letter),  and (v)  Liens  for  real  estate  Taxes  not  yet  due  and  payable,
mechanics',   carriers',  workmen's,  and  repairmen's  liens,  if  any,  which,
individually or in the aggregate, do not materially detract from the value of or
materially  interfere  with the present use of any of the JP Properties  subject
thereto or affected  thereby.  Schedule 2.9(a) to the JP Disclosure Letter lists
each of the JP Properties which are under development or substantial  renovation
as of the date of this  Agreement  and  describes  generally  the status of such
development or renovation as of the date hereof.

     (b)  Schedule  2.9(b)  to the JP  Disclosure  Letter  sets  forth a list of
policies of title  insurance  (the  "Existing  Title  Policies")  that have been
issued  insuring the  applicable JP  Subsidiary's  fee simple title or leasehold
estate, as the case may be, to the JP Properties owned by it. True, complete and
correct  copies of such policies  have been  provided or made  available to GGP.
Such  policies  are, at the date  hereof,  in full force and  effect.  Except as
provided in Schedule 2.9(b) to the JP Disclosure  Letter, no claim has been made
against any such policy.

     (c) Except as provided in Schedule 2.9(c) to the JP Disclosure  Letter,  JP
has  received no written  notice and  otherwise  has no  Knowledge  (i) that any
certificate,  permit or license from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction
over any of the JP Properties, or any agreement,  easement or other right, which
is in either case necessary,  in any material respect,  to permit the lawful use
and operation of the buildings and  improvements  on any of the JP Properties or
which is  necessary,  in any  material  respect,  to permit  the  lawful use and
operation of all  driveways,  roads and other means of egress and ingress to and
from any of the JP Properties, has not been obtained or is not in full force and
effect,  or of any pending threat of  modification or cancellation of any of the
same which would have a material adverse effect on such JP Property,  or (ii) of
any violation of any federal, state or municipal law,


                                       15
<PAGE>

ordinance,  order,  regulation or requirement affecting any of the JP Properties
issued by any Governmental  Entity which would have a material adverse effect on
such JP Property.

     (d) Neither JP nor any JP Subsidiary  has received any written or published
notice to the effect  that (i) any  condemnation  or  rezoning  proceedings  are
pending  or  threatened  with  respect to any of the JP  Properties  or (ii) any
zoning, building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will
be violated by the continued  maintenance,  operation or use of any buildings or
other improvements on any of the JP Properties or by the continued  maintenance,
operation or use of the parking areas which would have a material adverse effect
on such Property.

     (e) Schedule  2.9(e) sets forth the rent rolls for each JP Property,  which
rent rolls are not dated earlier than December 31, 2001 (the "JP Rent Roll"). JP
has made available to GGP and GGP Partnership true,  complete and correct copies
of  all  JP  Space  Leases  as  defined   herein,   including  all   amendments,
modifications, supplements, renewals, extensions and guarantees related thereto,
as of the date  hereof.  "JP Space  Lease"  means each  lease or other  right of
occupancy  affecting  or relating to a property in which JP, PDC LP or any other
JP Subsidiary (or an entity in which any of the foregoing directly or indirectly
has an  interest)  is the  landlord,  either  pursuant to the terms of the lease
agreement or as successor to any prior landlord,  but excluding any Ground Lease
(as defined herein) and excluding any lease, license or occupancy agreement with
a term of less  than 6 months  and/or  terminable  upon  not  more  than 30 days
notice.  Except for discrepancies that, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a material  adverse  effect on the  applicable  JP Property,  all
information  set forth in the JP Rent Roll is true,  complete  and correct as of
the date thereof.  Except as set forth in a delinquency report made available to
GGP and GGP Partnership,  none of JP or any JP Subsidiary, on the one hand, nor,
to the  Knowledge  of JP,  any other  party,  on the other  hand,  is in default
(whether  monetary or  non-monetary)  under any JP Space Lease,  except for such
defaults that  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not have a JP Material
Adverse Effect.

     (f) With regard to any JP Property  where JP or any JP  Subsidiary  holds a
leasehold  estate or is the lessor  under any ground  lease (a "Ground  Lease"),
each such Ground Lease (and whether JP or such JP Subsidiary is lessor or lessee
with respect  thereto) is  identified  on Schedule  2.9(f) to the JP  Disclosure
Letter and JP has provided to GGP and GGP Partnership true, complete and correct
copies  of  all  Ground  Leases,   including  all   amendments,   modifications,
supplements, renewals, extensions and guaranties related thereto, as of the date
hereof.  Each Ground Lease is a valid and subsisting lease and none of JP or any
JP Subsidiary,  on the one hand,  nor, to the Knowledge of JP, none of the other
parties under the Ground Lease, on the other hand, is in default under any terms
thereunder,  except for such defaults  that,  individually  or in the aggregate,
would not have a JP Material Adverse Effect.

     (g) With regard to any JP Property where JP or any JP Subsidiary is a party
to a reciprocal  easement  agreement,  operating  agreement or similar agreement
imposing  obligations  on, and granting rights to, a JP Property and an adjacent
property owned by a third party (any such agreement,  a "REA"), each such REA is
identified on Schedule 2.9(g) to the JP Disclosure Letter and JP has provided to
GGP and GGP Partnership true, complete and correct copies of all REAs, including
all amendments, modifications,  supplements, renewals, extensions and guaranties
related thereto,  as of the date hereof.  Each REA is a valid agreement and none
of JP or any JP  Subsidiary,  on the one hand,  nor, to the Knowledge of JP, any
other  party  to a REA,  on the  other  hand,  is in  default  under  any  terms
thereunder,  except for such defaults  that,  individually  or in the aggregate,
would not have a JP Material Adverse Effect.

     (h) To the Knowledge of JP, there are no pending threats of modification or
cancellation  of any Property  Permits that,  individually  or in the aggregate,
would have a material  adverse effect on the JP Property for which such Property
Permits are required, and no Property Permit for any JP


                                       16
<PAGE>

Property  will  cease  to be  effective  as a  result  of  the  consummation  of
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement which would have a material adverse
effect on such JP Property.

     (i) Schedule 2.9(i) to the JP Disclosure  Letter contains a true,  complete
and correct list, by type of insurance,  carrier,  coverages  (including limits)
and term,  of all material  policies of casualty,  liability  and other types of
insurance  (except  title  insurance)  carried  by JP or any JP  Subsidiary,  as
applicable,  with respect to the JP  Properties.  All such  policies are in full
force  and  effect  and  none of JP or any JP  Subsidiary,  as  applicable,  has
received  from  any  insurance   company  notice  of  any  material  defects  or
deficiencies  affecting  the  insurability  of  JP  or  any  JP  Subsidiary,  as
applicable,  or any of their  respective  assets  thereunder,  including  the JP
Properties.

     2.10 Environmental Matters.

     (a)  "Environmental  Law" shall mean all  applicable  Laws,  including  any
plans, other criteria, or guidelines promulgated pursuant to such Laws, relating
to the protection of human health,  safety and natural resources,  animal health
or welfare or the environment,  including,  without limitation, Laws relating to
the use, manufacturing,  production, generation, installation, recycling, reuse,
sale, storage, handling,  transport,  treatment,  release, threatened release or
disposal of any Hazardous Materials  (including the Comprehensive  Environmental
Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. ss.ss. 9601 et
seq. ("CERCLA")). "Hazardous Materials" shall mean substances, wastes, radiation
or materials (whether solids, liquids or gases) (i) which are hazardous,  toxic,
infectious, explosive,  radioactive,  carcinogenic, or mutagenic, (ii) which are
listed,  regulated or defined  under any  Environmental  Law, and shall  include
"hazardous wastes," "hazardous substances," "hazardous materials," "pollutants,"
"contaminants," "toxic substances,"  "radioactive  materials" or "solid wastes,"
(iii)  which  contain  without  limitation   polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs),
asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints,  urea-formaldehyde
foam  insulation,  or  petroleum  or  petroleum  products  (including,   without
limitation,  crude oil or any  fraction  thereof)  or (v) which pose a hazard to
human health, safety, natural resources, industrial hygiene, or the environment.
"Release"  shall have the meaning  set forth in Section  101 of CERCLA,  without
regard to the exclusions set forth therein.

     (b) Except as disclosed in the JP SEC  Documents or in Schedule  2.10(b) to
the JP  Disclosure  Letter  or in the  environmental  audits or  reports  listed
thereon,

          (i) none of JP, any of the JP Subsidiaries or, to JP's Knowledge,  any
     other  Person  has  caused  or  permitted  the  presence  of any  Hazardous
     Materials at, on or under any of the JP Properties and JP does not have any
     Knowledge of the presence of any Hazardous Materials at, on or under any of
     the JP  Properties,  such that the  presence  of such  Hazardous  Materials
     (including the presence of asbestos in any buildings or improvements at the
     JP  Properties)  would,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably be
     expected to have a JP Material Adverse Effect;

          (ii) except in accordance with the  Environmental  Permits (as defined
     herein),  to the  Knowledge of JP, there have been no Releases of Hazardous
     Materials  at,  on,  under  or from (A) the JP  Properties  or (B) any real
     property previously owned,  operated or leased by JP or the JP Subsidiaries
     (the "Former JP Properties"), in the case of (B), during the period of JP's
     or a JP Subsidiary's ownership, operation or tenancy, which with respect to
     any such Releases as described in this clause (ii) would,  individually  or
     in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be expected  to have a JP Material  Adverse
     Effect;

          (iii) JP and the JP Subsidiaries  have not received any written notice
     that any of them has failed to comply with  Environmental  Laws, or has any
     liability  under the


                                       17
<PAGE>

     Environmental  Laws,  except to the extent that such failures to comply and
     liabilities,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not  reasonably be
     expected to have a JP Material Adverse Effect; and

          (iv) JP and the JP Subsidiaries  have been duly issued,  and currently
     have and will  maintain  through the Closing Date,  all permits,  licenses,
     certificates   and  approvals   required   under  any   Environmental   Law
     (collectively,  the "Environmental Permits") to operate their businesses as
     currently  operated  except where the failure to obtain and  maintain  such
     Environmental   Permits  would  not,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to have a JP Material Adverse Effect.  JP and the JP
     Subsidiaries have timely filed applications for all Environmental  Permits,
     except where failure to do so would not have a JP Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) JP has previously delivered or made available to GGP true, complete and
correct  copies  of  all  material  third  party  reports,  including,   without
limitation,    environmental   site   assessment   reports   and   environmental
investigations and testing or analysis that are dated within 5 years of the date
of this  Agreement and are, to the Knowledge of JP, in the possession or control
of JP or any of the JP Subsidiaries  and which relate to the presence or release
of Hazardous Materials,  or any non-compliance with Environmental Laws by any of
them.

     2.11  Related  Party  Transactions.  Set forth in  Schedule  2.11 to the JP
Disclosure  Letter  is a  list  of all  material  arrangements,  agreements  and
contracts entered into by JP or any JP Subsidiary with (a) any investment banker
or financial advisor, or (b) any Person who is an officer, director or Affiliate
(as  defined  herein)  of JP,  any JP  Subsidiary,  any  relative  of any of the
foregoing,  or any entity of which any of the  foregoing  is an Affiliate or (c)
any Person who acquired JP Common Stock,  Price Group Stock or PDC OP Units,  in
each case, which remain in effect.  True,  complete and correct copies of all of
such documents have  previously  been delivered or made available to JP, and are
listed in Schedule 2.11 to the JP Disclosure  Letter. As used in this Agreement,
the term "Affiliate" shall have the same meaning as such term is defined in Rule
405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

     2.12 Employee  Benefits.  As used herein, the term "Employee Plan" includes
any pension,  retirement,  savings,  disability,  medical, dental, health, life,
death  benefit,  group  insurance,  fringe  benefit,  profit  sharing,  deferred
compensation,  stock option or grant,  bonus,  incentive,  vacation pay, tuition
reimbursement,  severance pay, or other employee benefit plan, trust, agreement,
contract, policy or commitment (including, without limitation, any pension plan,
as defined in Section 3(2) of the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of
1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA")
("Pension  Plan"),  and any  welfare  plan as defined  in Section  3(1) of ERISA
("Welfare  Plan")),   whether  any  of  the  foregoing  is  funded,  insured  or
self-funded,  written  or  oral,  (i)  sponsored  or  maintained  by JP,  any JP
Subsidiary or any entity that presently  would be deemed to be a single employer
with JP or any JP Subsidiary  under Section 414(b),  (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
(each, a "Controlled  Group Member") and covering any Controlled  Group Member's
active  or  former  employees  (or  their  beneficiaries),  (ii)  to  which  any
Controlled  Group Member is a party or by which any Controlled  Group Member (or
any of the rights,  properties or assets thereof) is bound or (iii) with respect
to which any Controlled  Group Member may otherwise have any material  liability
(whether or not such  Controlled  Group Member  still  maintains  such  Employee
Plan).  Each  Employee  Plan is listed  on  Schedule  2.12 to the JP  Disclosure
Letter.  Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.12 to the JP Disclosure Letter,  with
respect to the Employee Plans:

     (a) No Controlled  Group Member has any liability under any Welfare Plan or
otherwise for continuing  benefits or coverage for any participant or any spouse
or  beneficiary  of  a  participant  after  such  participant's  termination  of
employment, except as may be required by Section


                                       18
<PAGE>

4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),  or Section
601 (et seq.) of ERISA, or under any applicable state law.

     (b)  Each  Employee  Plan  complies  in  all  material  respects  with  the
applicable  requirements  of ERISA and any other  applicable  law governing such
Employee   Plan,  and  each  Employee  Plan  has  at  all  times  been  properly
administered in all material  respects in accordance with all such  requirements
of law,  and in  accordance  with its  terms  and the  terms  of any  applicable
collective   bargaining  agreement  to  the  extent  consistent  with  all  such
requirements  of law. Each Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified  under
Section 401(a) of the Code  ("Qualified  Pension Plan") has received a favorable
determination  letter from the IRS stating that such Plan meets the requirements
of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust  associated  with such Plan, if
any, is tax-exempt  under  Section  501(a) of the Code and no event has occurred
which would  reasonably  be expected to jeopardize  the qualified  status of any
such plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust under  Sections  401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code,  respectively.  Each Qualified Pension Plan has been
or will be timely amended for the  requirements of the tax legislation  commonly
known as "GUST" and will be  submitted  to the  Internal  Revenue  Service for a
favorable  determination  letter within the remedial amendment period prescribed
by "GUST." None of the  Employee  Plans is a multiple  employer  plan subject to
Section 413(c) of the Code or a multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA. None of the Employee Plans is currently subject to an
audit,  investigation or review by a Governmental Entity pursuant to a voluntary
compliance program or otherwise. No lawsuits,  claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) or complaints  to, or by, any Person or  Governmental  Entity have
been filed,  are pending or, to the Knowledge of JP, are threatened with respect
to any  Employee  Plan  and,  to  the  Knowledge  of JP,  there  is no  fact  or
contemplated  event which would  reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
lawsuit,  claim (other than  routine  claims for  benefits)  or  complaint  with
respect to any Employee Plan. Without limiting the foregoing,  the following are
true with respect to each Employee Plan:

          (i)  all  Controlled  Group  Members  have  complied  in all  material
     respects with the reporting and disclosure requirements of ERISA, the Code,
     or both, with respect to each Employee Plan and no Controlled  Group Member
     has incurred any material  liability in connection  with such  reporting or
     disclosure;

          (ii) all  contributions  and payments  with respect to Employee  Plans
     that are required to be made by a  Controlled  Group Member with respect to
     periods  ending on or before the Closing Date  (including  periods from the
     first day of the  current  plan or policy  year to the  Closing  Date) have
     been,  or will be, made or accrued  before the Closing  Date in  accordance
     with the appropriate plan document, actuarial report, collective bargaining
     agreements or insurance  contracts or arrangements or as otherwise required
     by ERISA or the Code; and

          (iii)  to the  extent  applicable,  JP has  delivered  to GGP  and GGP
     Partnership true, complete and correct copies of (A) plan documents, or any
     and all other  documents that  establish the existence of the plan,  trust,
     arrangement, contract, policy or commitment and all amendments thereto, (B)
     the most recent  determination  letter,  if any, received from the Internal
     Revenue  Service,  (C) the three most recent Form 5500 Annual  Reports (and
     all schedules and reports relating  thereto) and actuarial  reports and (D)
     all  related  trust  agreements,   insurance  contracts  or  other  funding
     agreements that implement each such Employee Plan.

     (c) With  respect  to each  Employee  Plan there has not  occurred,  and no
Person is contractually  bound to enter into, any prohibited  transaction within
the  meaning of  Section  4975(c)  of the Code or  Section  406 of ERISA,  which
transaction  is not exempt under  Section  4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of
ERISA and which  could  subject JP or any  Controlled  Group  Member to material
liability.


                                       19
<PAGE>

     (d) No Controlled Group Member has ever maintained, participated in or been
obligated to contribute to any Pension Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title
IV of ERISA, including without limitation, to a multiemployer plan as defined in
Section  3(37) of ERISA.  No  Controlled  Group  Member or any trade or business
which  is or has  been  for the  last six  years  under  common  control  with a
Controlled  Group  Member  under  Section 414 of the Code or Section  4001(b) of
ERISA  ("ERISA  Affiliate")  has  (while  under  common  control)  incurred  any
liability  under  Title IV of ERISA or  Section  412 of the Code and no event or
condition exists with respect to a Pension Plan, including,  without limitation,
a multiemployer  plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA which could give rise
to a lien  on any of  the  assets  of a  Controlled  Group  Member  or an  ERISA
Affiliate.

     (e) With respect to each Welfare Plan  maintained by any  Controlled  Group
Member,  such Plan provides the Plan Sponsor the authority to amend or terminate
such  Welfare  Plan at any time,  without  liability  after  such  amendment  or
termination  for  continuation  of benefits  provided prior to such amendment or
termination.

     (f) Except as provided in Section 5.7(c), Section 5.7(e) or as disclosed in
Schedule 2.12 of the JP  Disclosure  Letter,  no employee of a Controlled  Group
Member will become entitled to any  retirement,  severance or similar benefit or
enhanced  or  accelerated  benefit  solely  as  a  result  of  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby.  Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.12 of the JP Disclosure
Letter, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  no amount required to
be paid or payable to or with  respect to any  employee  of a  Controlled  Group
Member in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as
a result thereof or as a result of such  transactions  in  conjunction  with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code.

     2.13 Employees; Employee Policies. A true, complete and correct list of (a)
the names, job titles, annual salaries and all bonuses of all salaried employees
of JP and the JP  Subsidiaries,  and (b) the  wage  rates  for all  non-salaried
employees  of JP and  the JP  Subsidiaries  as of the  date  hereof,  and  true,
complete  and  correct  copies  of  all  employee  handbooks  of JP  and  the JP
Subsidiaries  currently in effect, have been provided to GGP and GGP Partnership
separately.  None  of JP or any of the JP  Subsidiaries  is  subject  to a union
organizing  effort  or a party  to a union  contract  or  collective  bargaining
agreement.  None of JP or any of the JP  Subsidiaries is a party to any pending,
or to the Knowledge of JP, threatened labor dispute.  JP and the JP Subsidiaries
are in material  compliance with employment and labor laws.  There are no claims
pending,  or to the Knowledge of JP,  threatened to be brought,  in any court or
administrative  agency  or  before  any  arbitrator  by any  former  or  current
employees of JP or the JP Subsidiaries (i) for compensation, severance benefits,
vacation pay or pension  benefits or (ii) arising out of the status of JP or any
of the JP  Subsidiaries  as an  employer,  whether  in the  form of  claims  for
employment  discrimination,  harassment,  unfair  labor  practices,  grievances,
wrongful discharge or otherwise.

     2.14 Taxes.

     (a) Each of JP and the JP  Subsidiaries  (i) has filed all Tax  returns and
reports  required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension
properly  granted by a  Governmental  Entity having  authority to do so) and all
such returns and reports are  accurate  and  complete in all material  respects,
(ii) has paid (or JP has paid on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined herein) shown
on such returns and reports as required to be paid by it, and (iii) has complied
in all  material  respects  with all  applicable  laws,  rules  and  regulations
relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation,
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441,  1442,  1445,  3121, and 3402 of
the Code or similar  provisions under any foreign laws) and has, within the time
period  prescribed  by law,  withheld  and paid over to the proper  Governmental
Entities all amounts  required to be so withheld and paid over under  applicable
laws and  regulations,  except,  with  respect to all of the  foregoing  clauses
(a)(i), (a)(ii) and


                                       20
<PAGE>

(a)(iii),  where the  failure to file such Tax returns and reports or failure to
pay such Taxes or failure to comply  with such  withholding  requirements  would
not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to have a JP
Material Adverse Effect. The most recent audited financial  statements contained
in the JP SEC  Documents  reflect an  adequate  reserve for all  material  Taxes
payable by JP and the JP  Subsidiaries  for all  taxable  periods  and  portions
thereof  through  the JP  Financial  Statement  Date.  Since  the  JP  Financial
Statement  Date, JP has incurred no liability for material  Taxes under Sections
857(b),  860(c)  or 4981 of the  Code,  including  without  limitation,  any Tax
arising from a  prohibited  transaction  described  in Section  857(b)(6) of the
Code,  and none of JP or any JP Subsidiary  has incurred any material  liability
for Taxes other than in the  ordinary  course of its trade or business and other
than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of property.
No event has  occurred,  and no condition or  circumstance  exists,  which could
reasonably be expected to result in any Tax described in the preceding  sentence
being imposed upon JP or any JP  Subsidiary.  None of JP or any JP Subsidiary is
the subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of federal
income Taxes, and to JP's Knowledge,  no audit,  examination or other proceeding
in respect of federal  income Taxes  involving any of JP or any JP Subsidiary is
being  considered by any Tax authority.  To the Knowledge of JP, no deficiencies
for any Taxes have been  proposed,  asserted  or  assessed  against JP or any JP
Subsidiary, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are
pending.  Except as set forth in Schedule 2.14 of the JP Disclosure Letter, none
of JP or any JP  Subsidiary  has made any  payments,  is  obligated  to make any
payments,  or is a party to any  agreement  that could  obligate  it to make any
payments  that are not fully  deductible  under  Sections  162(m) or 280G of the
Code.  None of the  assets of JP or any JP  Subsidiary  is  subject  to any Lien
arising in  connection  with any  failure or alleged  failure to pay any Tax. As
used in this Agreement,  "Taxes" shall include all taxes, charges,  fees, levies
and other assessments,  including,  without limitation,  income, gross receipts,
excise, property,  sales, withholding (including,  without limitation,  dividend
withholding and withholding  required  pursuant to Sections 1445 and 1446 of the
Code), social security,  occupation,  use, service, license, payroll, franchise,
transfer and  recording  taxes,  fees and charges,  including  estimated  taxes,
imposed by the United  States or any taxing  authority  (domestic  or  foreign),
whether  computed on a separate,  consolidated,  unitary,  combined or any other
basis, and any interest, fines, penalties or additional amounts attributable to,
or imposed upon,  or with respect to any such taxes,  charges,  fees,  levies or
other assessments.

     (b) JP (i) for all taxable  years for which the  Internal  Revenue  Service
could  assert a tax  liability,  has been  subject to  taxation as a real estate
investment  trust (a "REIT")  within the  meaning of Section 856 of the Code and
has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for all such years, (ii) has
operated  since December 31, 2001 to the date of this  representation,  and will
continue  to  operate,  in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable
year  ending on the earlier of  December  31,  2002 or the Closing  Date and, if
later, for the taxable year of JP ending on the Closing Date (provided that, for
purposes of applying  Section 857 of the Code for the taxable  year of JP ending
on the Closing Date,  the earnings and profits of JP for such taxable year shall
be computed  assuming that (A) Section  562(e) of the Code applies to the deemed
sale of JP's  assets  pursuant  to the Merger  and (B) that the  Merger  will be
treated for federal  income tax purposes in the manner  described in paragraph G
of the Recitals  hereof),  and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action
which would  reasonably  be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a
REIT and, to JP's Knowledge,  no such challenge has been proposed, is pending or
threatened. Each JP Subsidiary which is a partnership,  joint venture or limited
liability  company has been since its  formation and continues to be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded  entity and not as a
corporation  or an  association  taxable  as a  corporation.  PDC  LP  is  not a
publicly-traded  partnership  within the meaning of Section  7704(b) of the Code
that is taxable as a corporation  pursuant to Section  7704(a) of the Code. Each
JP Subsidiary  which is a  corporation  has been since its formation a qualified
REIT  subsidiary  under  Section  856(i)  of the  Code.  Neither  JP nor  any JP
Subsidiary  holds any asset (x) the  disposition  of which  would be  subject to
rules  similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election  under IRS
Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treas.  Reg. Sec.  1.337(d)-5T or (y) which is subject
to a consent filed  pursuant to Section  341(f) of the Code and the  regulations




                                       21

thereunder.  JP does  not own,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  interest  in any
"taxable  REIT  subsidiary,"  as that term is defined  by Section  856(l) of the
Code.

     2.15 No Payments to Employees,  Officers or Directors. Schedule 2.15 to the
JP  Disclosure  Letter  contains  a  true,  complete  and  correct  list  of all
arrangements,  agreements or plans pursuant to which cash and non-cash  payments
will become  payable,  and the  maximum  aggregate  amount  which may be payable
thereunder to each employee, officer or director of JP or any JP Subsidiary as a
result of the Mergers or a termination of service subsequent to the consummation
of the  Mergers.  Except as  described  in  Schedule  2.15 to the JP  Disclosure
Letter, or as otherwise  provided for in this Agreement,  there is no employment
or severance contract,  or other agreement  requiring payments,  cancellation of
indebtedness or other  obligation to be made on a change of control or otherwise
as a result of the consummation of any of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement  or  as a  result  of a  termination  of  service  subsequent  to  the
consummation of any of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement,  with
respect to any employee,  officer or director of JP or any JP Subsidiary.  There
is no agreement  or  arrangement  with any  employee,  officer or other  service
provider  under  which JP or any JP  Subsidiary  has  agreed to pay any Tax that
might be owed under  Section  4999 of the Code with  respect to payments to such
individuals. Schedule 2.15 to the JP Disclosure Letter contains a true, complete
and correct list of each  indemnification or similar agreement under which JP or
any JP  Subsidiary  has agreed to  indemnify  any  current  or former  director,
officer, manager, trustee or employee of any such entity.

     2.16  Broker.  Except as set forth in  Schedule  2.16 to the JP  Disclosure
Letter,  no broker,  investment  banker,  financial  advisor or other  Person is
entitled to any broker's,  finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the  transactions  contemplated  hereby based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of JP or any JP Subsidiary.

     2.17 Compliance  with Laws.  Except as set forth on Schedule 2.17 to the JP
Disclosure  Letter,  none of JP or any JP  Subsidiary  has violated or failed to
comply with any Laws  applicable  to its  business,  properties  or  operations,
except to the extent that such  violations and failures would not,  individually
or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to have a JP  Material  Adverse
Effect.

     2.18 Contracts; Debt Instruments.

     (a) None of JP or any JP Subsidiary  has received a written  notice that it
is in violation of or in default under any Material Contract, as defined herein,
to which it is a party or by which  it or any of its  properties  or  assets  is
bound, nor to the Knowledge of JP does such a violation or default exist, except
to the extent that such violation or default,  individually or in the aggregate,
would not  reasonably  be  expected to have a JP Material  Adverse  Effect.  For
purposes  of this  Agreement,  "Material  Contract"  shall  mean  (i)  any  loan
agreement,  indenture,  note, bond, debenture or any other document or agreement
evidencing a  capitalized  lease  obligation or other  Indebtedness  (as defined
herein) to any Person,  (ii) each  material  instrument,  contract or  agreement
(exclusive of any JP Space Lease) entered into by JP or any JP Subsidiary  which
may result in total  payments  by or  liability  of JP or any JP  Subsidiary  in
excess of $500,000, and (iii) any other agreements filed or required to be filed
as exhibits to the JP SEC  Documents  pursuant to Item  601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K under the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Section
2.18,  "Indebtedness"  shall mean (A) indebtedness  for borrowed money,  whether
secured or unsecured,  (B)  obligations  under  conditional  sale or other title
retention  agreements  relating  to  property  purchased  by  such  Person,  (C)
capitalized  lease  obligations,  (D) obligations under interest rate cap, swap,
collar or similar  transaction or currency hedging  transactions  (valued at the
termination  value thereof) and (E) guarantees of any such  indebtedness  of any
other Person.  Schedule 2.18(a) to the JP Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a list
of each such Material Contract,  which is not listed in any other subpart to the
JP Disclosure Schedule,  and the outstanding principal balance of each component
of  Indebtedness  of JP,  PDC LP and  each  other JP  Subsidiary  as of the date
specified in


                                       22
<PAGE>

the  schedule.  JP and PDC LP, have not received any notice and otherwise do not
have  Knowledge  that any other  party to any  Material  Contract  is in default
(whether  monetary or  non-monetary)  thereunder,  other than such defaults that
individually  or in the  aggregate  would not  result in a JP  Material  Adverse
Effect.

     (b) To the extent not set forth in response to the  requirements of Section
2.18(a),  Schedule 2.18(b) to the JP Disclosure  Letter sets forth each interest
rate  cap,   interest  rate  collar,   interest  rate  swap,   currency  hedging
transaction,  and any other agreement relating to a similar transaction to which
JP or any JP  Subsidiary  is a party or an obligor with respect  thereto,  true,
complete  and correct  copies of which have been  previously  delivered  or made
available  to  GGP  and  GGP  Partnership.  There  are  no  loans  by JP or a JP
Subsidiary to any non wholly-owned JP Subsidiary except as set forth on Schedule
2.18(b) to the JP Disclosure  Letter (which  Schedule  indicates the outstanding
amount of Indebtedness as of the date hereof).

     (c) Except as set forth in Schedule  2.18(c) to the JP  Disclosure  Letter,
none of JP or any JP  Subsidiary  is a party to any  agreement  relating  to the
management of any JP Property by any Person other than JP or a JP Subsidiary.

     (d) None of JP or any JP Subsidiary is a party to any agreement pursuant to
which JP or any JP Subsidiary  manages or provides  services with respect to any
real properties other than JP Properties, except for the agreements described in
Schedule 2.18(d) to the JP Disclosure Letter,  true, complete and correct copies
of which have been delivered to GGP.

     (e) JP has delivered to GGP and GGP  Partnership  prior to the date of this
Agreement a true, complete and correct capital budget for the year 2002 relating
to budgeted capital  improvements  and  development.  Schedule 2.18(e) to the JP
Disclosure  Letter lists all material  agreements  entered into by JP or each of
the JP Subsidiaries relating to the development or construction of, or additions
or expansions to, any JP Properties (or any properties  with respect to which JP
has  executed  as of the date of this  Agreement a purchase  agreement  or other
similar  agreement)  which are  currently in effect and under which JP or any of
the JP Subsidiaries  currently has, or expects to incur, an obligation in excess
of  $250,000  in the  aggregate.  True,  complete  and  correct  copies  of such
agreements  have  previously  been  delivered  or made  available to GGP and GGP
Partnership.

     (f)  Schedule  2.18(f) to the JP  Disclosure  Letter  lists all  agreements
entered into by JP or any JP Subsidiary  providing for the sale of, or option to
sell, any JP Properties or the purchase of, or option to purchase,  by JP or any
JP Subsidiary,  on the one hand, or the other party thereto,  on the other hand,
any real estate which are currently in effect.

     (g) Except as set forth in Schedule  2.18(g) to the JP  Disclosure  Letter,
none  of JP or  any  JP  Subsidiary  has  any  material  continuing  contractual
liability (A) for  indemnification  or otherwise under any agreement relating to
the sale of real estate previously owned, whether directly or indirectly,  by JP
or any JP Subsidiary or (B) to pay any additional  purchase price for any of the
JP Properties.

     (h) Except as set forth in Schedule  2.18(h) to the JP  Disclosure  Letter,
none of JP or any JP  Subsidiary  has entered  into or is  subject,  directly or
indirectly,  to any Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, a "Tax Protection
Agreement" is an agreement, oral or written, (i) that has as one of its purposes
to permit a Person to take the  position  that such Person  could defer  federal
taxable  income that  otherwise  might have been  recognized  upon a transfer of
property to PDC LP or any other JP  Subsidiary  that is treated as a partnership
for federal  income tax  purposes,  and that (A)  prohibits  or restricts in any
manner the  disposition of any assets of JP or any JP  Subsidiary,  (B) requires
that  JP  or  any  JP  Subsidiary  maintain,   or  put  in  place,  or  replace,
indebtedness, whether or not secured by one or more of the JP


                                       23
<PAGE>

Properties,  or (C) requires that JP or any JP Subsidiary offer to any Person at
any  time  the  opportunity  to  guarantee  or  otherwise  assume,  directly  or
indirectly  (including,   without  limitation,  through  a  deficit  restoration
obligation, indemnification agreement or other similar arrangement), the risk of
loss for federal income tax purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities of JP
or any JP Subsidiary,  (ii) that specifies or relates to a method of taking into
account  book-tax  disparities  under Section 704(c) of the Code with respect to
one or more assets of JP or a JP Subsidiary, or (iii) that requires a particular
method for  allocating one or more  liabilities  of JP or a JP Subsidiary  under
Section 752 of the Code.  None of JP or any JP  Subsidiary is in violation of or
in default under any Tax Protection Agreement.

     (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18(i) to the JP Disclosure Letter and
except for the Nondisclosure  Agreement,  dated January 31, 2002, between JP and
GGP (the  "Confidentiality  Agreement"),  and other  confidentiality  agreements
entered  into  in the  ordinary  course  of  business,  neither  JP  nor  any JP
Subsidiary  is a party to any  confidentiality,  standstill,  lock-up  or voting
agreement.

     (j) Other than any breach which,  individually  or in the aggregate,  would
not  have a JP  Material  Adverse  Effect,  none of JP,  PDC LP or any  other JP
Subsidiary is in breach of any provision of any agreement,  document or contract
relating to the capital stock or other equity interests of a non-wholly-owned JP
Subsidiary,  all of which agreements,  documents and contracts are (a) listed in
Schedule 2.18(j) to the JP Disclosure Letter, (b) unmodified except as described
therein  and (c) in full force and  effect.  To the  Knowledge  of JP, the other
parties  to any such  agreement,  document  or  contract  which is of a material
nature are not in material breach of any of their respective  obligations  under
such agreements, documents or contracts.

     2.19 Opinion of Financial  Advisor.  JP has received the written opinion of
UBS  Warburg  LLC,  JP's  financial  advisor,  to the effect  that the  proposed
consideration  to be received by the holders of JP Common  Stock is fair to such
holders from a financial point of view.

     2.20 State Takeover  Statutes;  JP Rights Plan;  Ownership  Limits.  JP has
taken all action  necessary  to exempt  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  (including the actions and  transactions  contemplated  by the Voting
Agreement) from the operation of any "fair price," "moratorium,"  "control share
acquisition" or any other anti-takeover statute or similar statute enacted under
the laws of the State of Maryland,  the State of Delaware or federal laws of the
United States or similar  statute or  regulation (a "Takeover  Statute") and the
limitations imposed by Article IX of the JP Articles.  The Board of Directors of
JP has  resolved  to,  and  prior to the  Closing,  JP  shall,  take all  action
necessary to render the rights (the "JP Rights") issued and/or outstanding under
or pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement,  dated as
of January 13, 2001, as amended, between JP and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as
rights agent (the "JP Rights  Agreement"),  inapplicable  to the  Mergers,  this
Agreement and the other transactions  contemplated hereby (including the actions
and transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreement).

     2.21 Investment Company Act of 1940. None of JP or any JP Subsidiary is, or
at the Effective  Time will be,  required to be registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

     2.22 Definition of Knowledge of JP. As used in this  Agreement,  the phrase
"Knowledge  of JP" (or  words of  similar  import)  means  the  actual  (and not
constructive or imputed)  knowledge of those individuals  identified in Schedule
2.22 to the JP Disclosure Letter.

vote of the  holders  of at least a  majority  of the  outstanding  shares of JP
Common  Stock and Price Group  Stock,  voting  together  as a single  class with
respect to the  Merger,  is the only vote or consent of the holders of


                                       24
<PAGE>

any class or  series of JP  capital  stock  necessary  or  required  under  this
Agreement,  the JP Articles, JP Bylaws or applicable law to approve the Mergers,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The affirmative vote or
consent of JP, in its capacity as the general partner of PDC LP, and the holders
of PDC OP Units as described on Schedule 2.5 to the JP Disclosure Letter are the
only  votes or  consents  of the  holders  of any  class or  series  of PDC LP's
partnership  interests  necessary or required under this  Agreement,  the PDC LP
Agreement,  any other  agreement or applicable law to approve the Mergers,  this
Agreement,  the PDC LP Amendment and the transactions  contemplated  hereby.  By
virtue of executing  this  Agreement,  JP, in its  capacity as general  partner,
shall be deemed to have approved the matters described in the second sentence of
this Section 2.23.

     2.24 Intellectual  Property. JP and each JP Subsidiary,  as applicable own,
or are licensees of or otherwise possess legally  enforceable rights to use, all
material  patents,  trademarks,  trade names,  domain  names,  service marks and
copyrights, any applications for and registrations of such patents,  trademarks,
trade names,  domain names,  service marks and  copyrights,  and all  processes,
formulae, methods, schematics,  technology, know-how, computer software programs
or applications and tangible or intangible  proprietary  information or material
that are used or necessary  to conduct  their  business as currently  conducted,
except  where  the  failure  to  own,  be  so  licensed  or  otherwise  possess,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a JP Material Adverse Effect.

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GGP,
                         GGP PARTNERSHIP AND ACQUISITION

     Except as set forth in the GGP SEC Documents (as defined  herein) or in the

GGP, GGP Partnership and Acquisition jointly and severally represent and warrant
to JP as follows:

     3.1 Organization,  Standing and Power of GGP, GGP Partnership,  Acquisition

business  as now  being  conducted.  GGP is duly  qualified  or  licensed  to do
business as a foreign  corporation and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction
in  which  the  nature  of its  business  or the  ownership  or  leasing  of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing  necessary,  other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,  individually or
in the  aggregate,  would not  reasonably  be expected  to have an GGP  Material
Adverse  Effect,  as defined  herein.  GGP has made available to JP complete and
correct  copies of the charter  and by-laws of GGP, in each case,  as amended or
supplemented to the date of this Agreement (respectively,  the "GGP Charter" and

licensed to do business as a foreign limited partnership and is in good standing
in each  jurisdiction  in which the nature of its  business or the  ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other

Material Adverse Effect,  as defined herein.  As used in this Agreement,  a "GGP
Material Adverse Effect" means


                                       25

to  the  business,  properties,  assets  (tangible  or  intangible),   financial
condition or results of operations of GGP, GGP Partnership and any Subsidiary of
GGP or GGP Partnership  (collectively,  "GGP  Subsidiaries"),  taken as a whole,
except, in each case, as a result of (i) changes in general economic  conditions
nationally  or  regionally,  (ii)  changes  affecting  the real estate  industry
generally  which  do not  affect  GGP or GGP  Partnership,  as the  case may be,
materially  disproportionately relative to other participants in the real estate
industry  similarly  situated,  or  (iii)  in  and of  itself  and  without  the
occurrence  of any other GGP  Material  Adverse  Effect,  changes in the trading
prices of GGP Common  Stock or GGP  Preferred  Stock (as  defined  herein).  All

or licensed to do business as a foreign limited liability company and is in good
standing  in each  jurisdiction  in which  the  nature  of its  business  or the
ownership or leasing of its  properties  makes such  qualification  or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed,  individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to  have a GGP  Material  Adverse  Effect.  GGP and GGP  Partnership  have  made

Acquisition.

     (d) Partnership  Acquisition is a Maryland limited  liability  company duly

Partnership  have  made  available  to JP  complete  and  correct  copies of the
organizational documents of Partnership Acquisition.

accordance  with and subject to their  respective  terms,  subject to applicable

in any material  respect or reasonably be expected to have,  individually  or in
the aggregate, a GGP Material Adverse Effect.

     3.4 Litigation.  There is no suit,  action or proceeding  pending (in which
service  of  process  has  been  received  by an  employee  of  GGP  or  an  GGP
Subsidiary),  or, to the  Knowledge  of GGP,  GGP  Partnership,  Acquisition  or
Partnership  Acquisition,  threatened against or affecting GGP, GGP Partnership,
Acquisition,  Partnership  Acquisition or any other GGP Subsidiary that would be
reasonably  likely to prevent the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement.

     3.5 Interim Operations of Acquisition and Partnership Acquisition.  Each of
Acquisition  and  Partnership  Acquisition  was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, as of the Closing Date and

arrangements contemplated by this Agreement.

     3.6  Capital  Resources.  GGP and GGP  Partnership  will have  prior to the

available cash and marketable securities, will be


                                       28
<PAGE>

sufficient to fully fund the cash consideration  requirement for the Merger, the
Partnership  Merger, and the other  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Required Funding").

     3.7 GGP SEC Documents; Information Supplied.

     (a) GGP has filed all required reports,  schedules,  forms,  statements and
other  documents  with the SEC since  January 1, 1997  through  the date  hereof
(collectively,  the "GGP SEC  Documents").  All of the GGP SEC Documents  (other
than preliminary material), as of their respective filing dates, complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to such GGP SEC Documents.  None of the GGP SEC Documents at the time
of filing  contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make
the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later GGP SEC Documents filed and publicly  available prior to the
date of this Agreement. The consolidated financial statements of GGP included in
the  GGP  SEC  Documents  complied  as to form  in all  material  respects  with
applicable  accounting  requirements  and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with  respect  thereto,  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with GAAP
(except,  in the case of unaudited  statements,  as permitted by the  applicable
rules and  regulations  of the SEC)  applied on a  consistent  basis  during the
periods  involved  (except as may be indicated in the notes  thereto) and fairly
presented  in  all  material   respects,   in  accordance  with  the  applicable
requirements  of GAAP and the applicable  rules and  regulations of the SEC, the
consolidated  financial  position of GGP and the  consolidated  GGP Subsidiaries
taken  as a whole as of the  dates  thereof,  and the  consolidated  results  of
operations  and cash flows for the periods then ended  (subject,  in the case of
unaudited  statements,  to  normal  year-end  audit  adjustments).   Except  for
liabilities  and  obligations  set forth in the GGP SEC Documents or in Schedule
3.7(a) to the GGP Disclosure  Letter or incurred by GGP, GGP  Partnership or any
GGP Subsidiary in the ordinary  course of business since December 31, 2001, none
of  GGP,  GGP  Partnership,  or  any  GGP  Subsidiary  has  any  liabilities  or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued,  absolute,  contingent or otherwise)
required by GAAP to be set forth on a  consolidated  balance  sheet of GGP or in
the notes thereto and which, individually or in the aggregate,  would have a GGP
Material Adverse Effect.

     (b)  None  of the  information  supplied  or to be  supplied  by  GGP,  GGP
Partnership,  Acquisition or Partnership Acquisition  specifically for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement or the Partner Solicitation Materials (as herein defined)
will,  at the date the Proxy  Statement  is filed with the SEC or mailed to JP's
stockholders  or at the time of the JP Stockholders  Meeting,  or at the time of
any amendment or supplement thereof,  contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state  any  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading.

     3.8 Taxes.  GGP (i) for all taxable  years for which the  Internal  Revenue
Service  could  assert a tax  liability,  has been subject to taxation as a REIT
within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements
to qualify as a REIT for all such years,  (ii) has operated  since  December 31,
2001 to the date of this representation,  and intends to continue to operate, in
such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the  taxable  year  ending on December
31, 2002 and  thereafter,  and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action
which would  reasonably  be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a
REIT and, to the Knowledge of GGP (as defined below), no such challenge has been
proposed,  is  pending  or  threatened.  Each  Subsidiary  of  GGP  which  is  a
partnership,  joint  venture or  limited  liability  company  has been since its
formation  and  continues  to be treated  for federal  income tax  purposes as a
partnership  or a disregarded  entity and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation.  GGP Partnership is not a publicly-traded  partnership
within  the  meaning  of  Section  7704(b)  of the  Code  that is  taxable  as a
corporation  pursuant to Section  7704(a) of the Code.  Each  Subsidiary  of GGP
which is a


                                       29
<PAGE>


corporation  has been since its formation (i) a corporation  subject to taxation
as a REIT  within the  meaning  of Section  856 of the Code and has for all such
years satisfied all requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT within
the  meaning of Section  856 of the Code and  intends to  continue to operate in
such a manner as to qualify as a REIT,  (ii) a qualified REIT  subsidiary  under
Section 856(i) of the Code or (iii) a "taxable REIT subsidiary," as that term is
defined by Section 856(i) of the Code.  Neither GGP nor any of its  Subsidiaries
holds any asset (x) the  disposition  of which would be subject to rules similar
to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under IRS Notice 88-19 or
Temporary  Treas.  Reg.  Sec.  1.337(d)-5T  or (y) which is subject to a consent
filed  pursuant to Section  341(f) of the Code and the  regulations  thereunder.
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.8 to the GGP Disclosure  Letter,  GGP does not
own,  directly or indirectly,  any interest in any "taxable REIT subsidiary," as
that term is defined by Section 856(l) of the Code.

     3.9 Definition of Knowledge of GGP. As used in this  Agreement,  the phrase
"Knowledge  of GGP" (or  words of  similar  import)  means the  actual  (and not
constructive or imputed)  knowledge of those individuals  identified in Schedule
3.9 to the GGP Disclosure Letter.

     3.10  Broker.  Except as set forth in Schedule  3.10 to the GGP  Disclosure
Letter,  no broker,  investment  banker,  financial  advisor or other  Person is
entitled to any broker's,  finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the  transactions  contemplated  hereby based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of GGP, GGP Partnership or any GGP Subsidiary.

in this Agreement, each of JP and PDC LP shall, and shall cause (or, in the case
of JP  Subsidiaries  that JP or PDC LP do not  control,  shall use  commercially

that it is availing  itself of any such  extensions and provided such extensions
do not adversely affect JP's status as a qualified REIT under the Code;

     (i) not make or rescind any election  relating to Taxes (unless required by
law or  necessary  to  preserve  JP's  status as a REIT or the  status of any JP
Subsidiary  as a  partnership  or  disregarded  entity  for  federal  income tax
purposes or as a qualified REIT subsidiary  under Section 856(i) of the Code, as
the case may be) provided, that nothing in this Agreement shall preclude JP from

Subsidiary;

     (l) make no  change  in the  number of  issued  and  outstanding  shares of

or by amending or granting any waiver under the JP Rights  Agreement),  directly
or indirectly,  any inquiries or the making of any proposal (including,  without

     (b) JP shall  notify GGP and GGP  Partnership  orally  and in  writing  (as
promptly as practicable  but in any event within 48 hours) of its receipt of any
inquiries and proposals  (including  the identity of the parties,  price and all

promptly  (but in any  event  within 48 hours)  inform  GGP and GGP  Partnership
orally and in writing with respect to any such inquiry or proposal  that becomes
reasonably  likely  to lead to a  Superior  Competing  Transaction  (as  defined
herein).

     (c) For purposes of this Agreement,  a "Competing  Transaction"  shall mean
any of the following,  whether occurring  directly or indirectly (other than the
transactions  expressly  provided  for  in  this  Agreement):  (i)  any  merger,

liquidation,  dissolution or similar transaction  involving JP (or any of the JP
Subsidiaries,  including  PDC LP);  (ii) any sale,  lease,  exchange,  mortgage,
pledge,  transfer  or other  disposition  of 20% or more of the assets or equity
securities of JP, PDC LP or any other JP Subsidiary in a single  transaction  or
series of related transactions,  excluding any bona fide financing  transactions
which do not, individually or in the aggregate,  have as a purpose or effect the
sale or transfer of control of such  assets;  (iii) any tender offer or exchange
offer for 20% or more of the outstanding  equity securities of JP, PDC LP or any
other JP Subsidiary or any transaction  resulting in the issuance of such amount
of securities;  or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention
to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

     (d) For  purposes of this  Agreement,  a "Superior  Competing  Transaction"
means a bona fide written proposal that was not invited, initiated, solicited or
encouraged,  directly or  indirectly,  by JP, PDC LP, any other JP Subsidiary or
any JP Representative for a Competing  Transaction made by a third party which a
majority of the entire Board of Directors of JP  determines  after  consultation
with its  financial  advisor,  in good  faith,  taking  into  account  financial
considerations and other relevant factors,  including relevant legal, financial,
tax,  regulatory  and  other  aspects  of such  proposal,  and  the  conditions,


                                       33
<PAGE>

prospects  and  time  required  for  completion  of  such  proposal,  to be more
favorable than the Mergers to the JP stockholders  and the holders of PDC Common
OP Units.

     4.3 Board Actions.  Notwithstanding  Section 4.2 or any other  provision of
this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  to the  extent  required  by the  fiduciary
obligations  of the Board of Directors of JP as determined by a majority of such
board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel, JP may:

     (a) disclose to its stockholders or holders of PDC OP Units any information
required to be disclosed under applicable Law;

     (b) to the extent applicable,  comply with Rule 14e-2(a)  promulgated under
the  Exchange Act with respect to a Competing  Transaction;  provided,  however,
that  neither JP nor its Board of  Directors  shall be  permitted  to approve or
recommend a Competing Transaction which is not a Superior Competing Transaction;

     (c)  if it  receives  a  proposal  for a  Competing  Transaction  that  was
unsolicited  and  its  Board  of  Directors  determines  in  good  faith  (after
consulting  with its  outside  counsel  and its  financial  advisor)  that  such
proposal is reasonably  likely to lead to a Superior  Competing  Transaction and
provided  further that JP provides prompt oral and written notice to GGP and GGP
Partnership to the effect that it is furnishing  information to such Person, (x)
furnish  non-public  information with respect to JP, PDC LP or any JP Subsidiary
to the  Person  who made such  proposal  (provided  that JP shall  furnish  such
information  pursuant to a confidentiality  agreement which is no more favorable
to such  Person  than the  Confidentiality  Agreement)  and (y)  participate  in
negotiations regarding such proposal,  provided that JP provides prompt oral and
written notice to GGP and GGP Partnership to the effect that it is entering into
discussions with such Person; and

     (d) approve or recommend  (and in connection  therewith  withdraw or modify
its approval or  recommendation  of this  Agreement  and the Mergers) a Superior
Competing  Transaction  or enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior
Competing Transaction.

     4.4 Conduct of GGP's and GGP Partnership's Business Pending Mergers. During
the period from the date of this  Agreement to the  Effective  Times,  except as
consented to in writing by JP or as expressly  contemplated  in this  Agreement,

cause each of the GGP Subsidiaries to:

     (a) take no action that would prevent or materially  delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

     (b)  promptly  deliver  to JP  true  and  correct  copies  of  any  report,
statement,  schedule or other  document  filed with the SEC by GGP subsequent to
the date of this Agreement; and

     (c) not  amend  the  articles  or  certificate  of  incorporation,  bylaws,
partnership  agreement,  operating  agreement or other charter or organizational
document of GGP or GGP Partnership,  in a manner which would require the consent
of the  Contributing  Holders  of PDC  Common  OP Units if such  amendment  were
effected following the Closing;

     4.5 Other  Actions.  Each of JP and PDC LP, on the one hand,  and GGP,  GGP
Partnership,  Acquisition and Partnership Acquisition,  on the other hand, shall
not take, and shall cause their respective  Subsidiaries not to take, any action
that would result in (a) any of the representations and warranties of such party
(without  giving  effect  to any  knowledge  qualification)  set  forth  in this
Agreement that are qualified as to materiality  becoming untrue, (b) any of such
representations and warranties (without


                                       34
<PAGE>


giving effect to any knowledge qualification) that are not so qualified becoming
untrue in any material  respect or (c) except as  contemplated by Section 4.2 or
4.3,  any of the  conditions  to the  Mergers  set forth in  Article 6 not being
satisfied.

     5.1  Preparation  of the Proxy  Statement;  Stockholders  Meeting;  Partner
Solicitation; Partner Approvals.

     (a) As  promptly  as  reasonably  practicable  following  the  date of this
Agreement, JP shall prepare and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act a proxy
statement and form of proxy (such proxy  statement  and proxy  together with any
amendments and supplements  thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and JP shall use its
commercially  reasonable  efforts to respond as promptly as  practicable  to any
comments of the SEC with respect  thereto and to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to JP's  stockholders  as promptly as  practicable  following the date of
this  Agreement.  JP shall  promptly  notify  GGP and GGP  Partnership  upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide
GGP and GGP  Partnership  with copies of all  correspondence  between JP and its
representatives,  on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand.
GGP and GGP Partnership  shall promptly  provide any information or responses to
comments,  or other assistance,  reasonably  requested in connection with any of
the foregoing.  Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy  Statement or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect  thereto,  JP (i) shall provide GGP and GGP
Partnership  an  opportunity  to review and comment on such document or response
and (ii) shall give reasonable consideration to all comments proposed by GGP and
GGP  Partnership.  Each of JP, PDC LP, GGP and GGP  Partnership  shall  promptly
correct any information  provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to
the extent that such  information  shall have become false or  misleading in any
material respect,  and JP shall cause such corrected  information to be included
in the Proxy Statement.

     (b) JP shall, as promptly as reasonably  practicable  following the date of
this Agreement,  establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders  (the "JP Stockholders  Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining  the JP  Stockholder  Approval.  Subject to Section 4.3, JP
shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders approval of
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

     (c) The Holders of PDC Common OP Units.

          (i) As promptly as reasonably  practicable  following the date of this
     Agreement,  JP,  PDC LP,  GGP and GGP  Partnership  shall  prepare  certain
     solicitation materials (the "Partner Solicitation  Materials"),  which will
     be used by GGP Partnership as a private  placement  memorandum to offer the
     GGP Series B  Preferred  OP Units to the holders of the PDC Common OP Units
     and by JP and PDC LP to solicit  the JP  Partner  Approvals.  Such  Partner
     Solicitation   Materials   shall  include  or   incorporate   by  reference
     information   about  GGP  and  GGP   Partnership,   a  description  of  the
     transaction,  the  position  of JP as the  general  partner  of PDC LP with
     respect to such transaction,  available appraisal rights for holders of PDC
     Common OP Units,  the impact of the Voting Agreement and other matters that
     the parties reasonably  determine are to be specified therein.  The parties
     shall  reasonably  cooperate  with  each  other in the  preparation  of the
     Partner Solicitation Materials.


                                       35
<PAGE>

          (ii) JP and PDC LP, on the one hand, and GGP and GGP  Partnership,  on
     the other  hand,  agree  that  none of the  information  supplied  or to be
     supplied by them for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Partner
     Solicitation Materials will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
     or omit to state  any  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or
     necessary to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances
     under which they are made,  not  misleading.  Each party  agrees that if it
     shall become aware prior to the  Partnership  Merger  Effective Time of any
     information  that  would  cause  any  of  the  statements  in  the  Partner
     Solicitation  Materials  to be  false or  misleading  with  respect  to any
     material  fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
     statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which they are
     made, not false or misleading,  it shall promptly  inform the other parties
     thereof and shall take the necessary  steps, in cooperation  with the other
     parties,   to  correct  such   information   and  to  disseminate   updated
     information.

          (iii) Subject to the fiduciary duties of JP, as the general partner of
     PDC LP, JP (A) agrees to seek the written  consents  and  approvals  of the
     holders  of PDC  Common OP Units on each of the  matters  specified  in the
     definition  of JP Partner  Approvals  and  recommend  to the holders of PDC
     Common OP Units approval of such matters,  and include such  recommendation
     in the  Partnership  Solicitation  Materials  and (B) hereby  approves  and
     consents to each of the matters  specified in the  definition of JP Partner
     Approvals  and  agrees  to vote  all of its PDC OP  Units  in favor of such
     matters (or to provide its consent with respect thereto).

          (iv) As promptly as reasonably  practicable following the date of this
     Agreement, GGP and GGP Partnership shall prepare a form of election in form
     and  substance  reasonably  acceptable  to JP and  PDC  LP  (the  "Form  of
     Election"),  pursuant  to which  each  holder of PDC  Common OP Units  will
     specify  (A) the  number of PDC  Common OP Units  which it  desires to have
     converted into the right to receive GGP Series B Preferred OP Units and (B)
     the number of PDC Common OP Units which it desires to have  converted  into
     the right to receive cash in the  Partnership  Merger.  Any holder electing
     option  (A)  must  also  agree to  become  a party  to the GGP  Partnership
     Agreement,  the GGP Series B OP Units Redemption Agreement,  the GGP Common
     OP  Units   Redemption   Agreement   and  the  Tax  Matters   Agreement  in
     substantially the form of Exhibit I attached hereto (together, the "Related
     Agreements").  In order to be  eligible  to elect to  receive  GGP Series B
     Preferred  OP Units in the  Partnership  Merger,  a holder of PDC Common OP
     Units must qualify as an "accredited investor" under the Securities Act.

          (v)  Concurrently  with  the  mailing  of the  Proxy  Statement  to JP
     Shareholders,  GGP  Partnership  shall mail Forms of Election to holders of
     record of PDC  Common  OP Units,  together  with the  Partner  Solicitation
     Materials.  An election to subscribe  for the GGP Series B Preferred  Units
     shall be effective only if a properly executed Form of Election is received
     by GGP Partnership prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on the second
     business day  preceding  the JP  Stockholders  Meeting.  If a holder of PDC
     Common OP Units fails to return a duly  completed  Form of Election  within
     the time period  specified  above and does not duly  perfect its  appraisal
     rights pursuant to the MRULPA,  such holder shall be deemed to have elected
     to  receive  cash  upon the  conversion  of its PDC  Common OP Units in the
     Partnership  Merger.  GGP Partnership and PDC LP by mutual  agreement shall
     have the  right to make  rules,  not  inconsistent  with the  terms of this
     Agreement, governing the validity of Forms of Election and the issuance and
     delivery of GGP Series B Preferred OP Units in the Partnership Merger.

          (vi) JP shall not exercise any appraisal, dissenters' or other similar
     rights  with  respect  to any  of its  PDC  OP  Units,  including,  without
     limitation, any rights under Section 10-208(f) of the MRULPA.


                                       36
<PAGE>

          (vii) The  parties  shall  reasonable  cooperate  with each other with
     respect to the matters set forth in this  Section  5.1(c),  and intend that
     the offer of the GGP  Series B  Preferred  Units  shall be  conducted  as a
     private  placement,  exempt  from  the  registration  requirements  of  the
     Securities Act.

     (d) GGP and GGP Partnership covenant and agree that,  concurrently with the
Closing,  they will each enter into, with each holder of PDC Common OP Units who
validly  elects to receive  GGP Series B Preferred  OP Units in the  Partnership
Merger,  the Related  Agreements to which they are parties,  and will reasonably
cooperate with such holders so that such holders become limited  partners of GGP
Partnership and enjoy the full rights and benefits of the GGP Series B Preferred
OP Units.

     5.2 Access to Information;  Confidentiality. Subject to the requirements of
confidentiality  agreements  with third parties in existence on the date hereof,
JP and PDC LP shall,  and shall cause each of the JP Subsidiaries  to, afford to
GGP and GGP Partnership and to the officers,  employees,  accountants,  counsel,
financial  advisors  and  other  representatives  of GGP  and  GGP  Partnership,
reasonable  access during normal  business hours prior to the Effective Times to
all their respective properties,  books, contracts,  commitments,  personnel and
records and,  during such period,  JP and PDC LP shall,  and shall cause each of
the JP Subsidiaries  to, furnish  promptly to GGP and GGP Partnership (a) a copy
of each report, schedule,  registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the  requirements of federal or state  securities
laws and (b) all other  information  concerning  its  business,  properties  and
personnel as GGP and GGP Partnership may reasonably request.

     5.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions  herein  provided,  (i) each of the
parties shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another
in (A) determining  which filings are required to be made prior to the Effective
Times  with,  and which  consents,  approvals,  permits  or  authorizations  are
required to be obtained prior to the Effective Times from, Governmental Entities
and any third  parties in  connection  with the  execution  and delivery of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B)
timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents,  approvals,
permits and authorizations; (ii) JP and PDC LP shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to obtain in  writing  any  consents  required  from  third  parties to
effectuate  the Mergers and the other  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  such
consents to be in form reasonably  satisfactory to GGP and GGP Partnership;  and
(iii) each of the parties shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken,  all  other  action  and do,  or cause to be done,  all other
things  necessary,  proper or  appropriate  to consummate and make effective the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. If at any time after the Effective
Times any further  action is  necessary or desirable to carry out the purpose of
this Agreement, each party shall take all such necessary action.

     (b) JP and PDC LP shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain from
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP access to all work  papers  relating to audits of JP
and  PDC  LP  performed  by   PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP,  and  the  continued
cooperation  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP with regard to the  preparation  of
consolidated financial statements for the Surviving Company.

     (c) JP and PDC LP shall give prompt notice to GGP and GGP Partnership,  and
GGP  and  GGP   Partnership   shall  give  prompt  notice  to  JP,  (i)  if  any
representation  or warranty made by it or them  contained in this Agreement that
is qualified as to  materiality  becomes  untrue or inaccurate in any respect or
any such  representation  or warranty that is not so qualified becomes untrue or
inaccurate  in any  material  respect  or (ii) of the  failure  by it or them to
comply  with or satisfy in any  material  respect  any  covenant,  condition  or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided,


                                       37
<PAGE>

however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the  conditions to the  obligations of
the parties under this Agreement.

     5.4 Tax Matters.

     (a) Purchase Price  Allocation.  On or prior to the Closing Date,  GGP, GGP
Partnership,  JP and PDC LP shall reach  agreement as to the manner in which the
consideration  to be paid pursuant to this Agreement,  together with any assumed
liabilities (the "Allocable Consideration"), shall be allocated among the assets
of JP and, to the extent applicable, the JP Subsidiaries.  Such allocation shall
be made in the manner  required by Section 1060 of the Code and the  regulations
promulgated  thereunder.  In making such  allocation,  the fair market values as
reasonably  determined by the parties shall apply. GGP, GGP Partnership,  JP and
PDC LP hereby  agree that IRS Form 8594 will be timely  filed based on such fair
market values.

     (b) Tax  Treatment  of Merger.  The parties  shall treat the Merger for all
income  tax  purposes  as a taxable  purchase  of assets by GGP  Partnership  in
exchange for the Allocable  Consideration and a liquidating  distribution of the
Merger  Consideration by JP to the JP shareholders within the meaning of Section
562(b)(1) of the Code including, without limitation, filing JP final Tax returns
consistent  with  such   treatment,   and  no  party  shall  take  any  position
inconsistent with such treatment.

     (c) Tax  Treatment  of  Partnership  Merger.  The  parties  shall treat the
Partnership  Merger,  for all tax purposes,  as a tax-free  contribution  by the
Contributing  Holders  of PDC  Common  OP  Units of  their  limited  partnership
interests in PDC LP to GGP Partnership in exchange for GGP Series B Preferred OP
Units under  Section  721 of the Code and a sale by the  Selling  Holders of PDC
Common  OP  Units  of  their  limited  partnership  interests  in  PDC LP to GGP
Partnership in exchange for cash,  including without  limitation,  filing PDC LP
and GGP  Partnership Tax returns  consistent  with such treatment,  and no party
shall take any position inconsistent with such treatment.

     (d) Payroll  Records.  GGP, GGP  Partnership and JP agree that, for federal
income tax purposes,  GGP Partnership will have purchased  substantially  all of
the  property  used  in the  business  of JP as a  result  of  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  and that, in connection  therewith,  GGP and/or
GGP Partnership will employ  individuals who immediately before the Closing Date
were employed in such business by JP. Accordingly, pursuant to Rev. Proc. 96-60,
1996-2  C.B.  399,  JP  shall  make  available  to GGP and GGP  Partnership  all
necessary  payroll records for the calendar year that includes the Closing Date,
with the  result  that GGP or GGP  Partnership  will  furnish a Form W-2 to each
employee  employed  by GGP or GGP  Partnership  who  had  been  employed  by JP,
disclosing  all wages and other  compensation  paid for such  calendar  year and
Taxes withheld  therefrom,  and JP will be relieved of the  responsibility to do
so.

     5.5 Public  Announcements.  Each party will  consult  with each other party
before  issuing,  and provide each other the  opportunity  to review and comment
upon, any press release or other written public statements,  including,  without
limitation,  any press release or other written public statement which addresses
in any manner the  transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement,  and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such written public  statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or
by obligations  pursuant to any listing  agreement with any national  securities
exchange,  in which case the disclosing party will use its reasonable efforts to
advise the other  parties prior to making the relevant  disclosure.  The parties
agree  that  the  initial  press  release  to be  issued  with  respect  to  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be in the form agreed to by the
parties prior to the execution of this Agreement.


                                       38

     5.6  Transfer  and  Gains  Taxes.   Each  party  shall   cooperate  in  the
preparation,  execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,  applications
or other documents  regarding any real property  transfer or gains,  sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer,  recording,
registration  and other  fees and any  similar  Taxes  which  become  payable in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement  (together with
any  related  interest,  penalties  or  additions  to Tax,  "Transfer  and Gains
Taxes").  On, from and after the Effective Time, GGP and GGP  Partnership  shall
pay or cause to be paid all Transfer  and Gains Taxes (which term shall  include
any transfer taxes  resulting from or relating to the Mergers,  but shall not in
any event be construed to include for these  purposes any Tax imposed  under the
Code or state income taxes) without  deduction or  withholding  from any amounts
payable to the holders of JP shares or limited partnership interests of PDC LP.

     5.7 Benefit Plans and Other Employee Arrangements.

     (a) Benefit  Plans.  After the Effective  Time, all employees of JP who are
employed by the Surviving Company shall, at the option of the Surviving Company,
either  continue to be eligible to participate  in an employee  benefit plan, as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, of JP which is, at the option of the Surviving
Company,  continued by the Surviving Company, or alternatively shall be eligible
to participate in the same manner as other similarly  situated  employees of GGP
Partnership  in any employee  benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
sponsored or maintained  by GGP and GGP  Partnership  after the Effective  Time.
With  respect to each such  employee  benefit  plan,  service  with JP or any JP
Subsidiary (as  applicable) and the predecessor of any of them shall be included
for  purposes  of  determining   eligibility  to  participate  and  vesting  (if
applicable) under such employee benefit plan. GGP and GGP Partnership  shall, or
shall  cause  the  Surviving  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  to,  (i) waive all
limitations as to  preexisting  conditions  exclusions and waiting  periods with
respect to participation and coverage  requirements  applicable to all employees
of JP who are employed by the Surviving Company under any Welfare Plan that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than
limitations  or waiting  periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been  satisfied as of the  Effective  Time under any
Welfare Plan  maintained for such employees  immediately  prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide each such employee of JP who is employed by the Surviving
Company  with  credit  for any  co-payments  and  deductibles  paid prior to the
Effective  Time  in  satisfying  any  applicable   deductible  or  out-of-pocket
requirements  under any  Welfare  Plans  that such  employees  are  eligible  to
participate in after the Effective Time.

     (b) Stock Option and  Restricted  Stock Plans.  At the Effective  Time, the
stock option plans or programs of JP and the restricted  stock plans or programs
of JP shall be discontinued.

     (c) JP Stock  Options.  As soon as  practicable  following the date of this
Agreement,  JP  shall  ensure  that  the  Board  of  Directors  of  JP  (or,  if
appropriate,  any committee administering the JP Stock Option plans) shall adopt
such  resolutions  or take such other  actions (if any) to provide  that each JP
Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested
or unvested) shall be converted at the Effective Time in the manner contemplated
by Section 1.7(d).  All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.7(c) shall be
subject  to any  required  withholding  of  Taxes  and  shall be paid as soon as
practicable  following the Effective Time,  without interest.  JP shall take all
actions  determined to be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
5.7(c)  as  mutually  agreed  by GGP and GGP  Partnership  and JP.  Prior to the
Effective  Time,  JP shall  ensure  that the Board of  Directors  of JP (or,  if
appropriate,  any committee  administering the JP Stock Option plans) shall take
or cause to be taken such  actions as are  required to cause the JP Stock Option
plans to terminate as of the Effective Time.

     (d) Withholding. To the extent required by applicable law, JP shall require
each employee who exercises a JP Stock Option or who receives JP Common Stock or
Price Group Stock pursuant to any existing commitment to pay to JP in cash or JP
Common Stock an amount sufficient to


                                       39
<PAGE>

satisfy in full JP's  obligation  to withhold  Taxes  incurred by reason of such
exercise or issuance  (unless and to the extent such  withholding  is  satisfied
pursuant to the provision regarding withholding in Section 1.8(i)).

     (e) JP Severance  Agreements.  No later than the Closing  Date,  GGP or GGP
Partnership shall negotiate and enter into severance agreements, which shall not
be subject to amendment or modification for the one-year period beginning on the
Closing Date without the mutual  consent of the parties,  with the JP and PDC LP
employees  identified  on  Exhibit J  attached  hereto  upon  substantially  the
economic terms set forth on such Exhibit J.

     5.8 Indemnification; Exculpation; Insurance.

          (a) (i) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,  action, suit,
     demand,   proceeding  or   investigation,   whether   civil,   criminal  or
     administrative,  including,  without  limitation,  any such claim,  action,
     suit,  demand,  proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now,
     or has been at any time prior to the date hereof,  or who becomes  prior to
     the  Effective  Time,  a director  or officer of JP, PDC LP or any other JP
     Subsidiary (the  "Indemnified  Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a
     party  based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
     or  pertaining  to (i) the fact that he is or was a director  or officer of
     JP, PDC LP or any other JP Subsidiary,  or is or was serving at the request
     of JP,  PDC LP or any other JP  Subsidiary  as a  director  or  officer  of
     another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
     or (ii) the negotiation,  execution or performance of this Agreement or any
     of the transactions  contemplated  hereby,  whether in any case asserted or
     arising  before or after the Effective  Time,  the parties  hereto agree to
     cooperate and use their  commercially  reasonable efforts to defend against
     and respond  thereto.  It is understood and agreed that JP shall indemnify,
     and hold  harmless,  and after the Effective  Time GGP and GGP  Partnership
     (JP, or GGP and GGP  Partnership,  as applicable,  being the  "Indemnifying
     Parties") shall jointly and severally indemnify,  and hold harmless, as and
     to the full extent  permitted by  applicable  law, each  Indemnified  Party
     against  any  losses,  claims,   damages,   liabilities,   costs,  expenses
     (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses (to the extent permitted
     below)), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
     any such threatened or actual claim,  action,  suit, demand,  proceeding or
     investigation,  and in the event of any such  threatened  or actual  claim,
     action,  suit,  demand,  proceeding or investigation  (whether  asserted or
     arising  before  or  after  the  Effective  Time),  JP,  and  GGP  and  GGP
     Partnership  after  the  Effective  Time,  shall  promptly  pay  reasonable
     expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
     or  investigation  to  each  Indemnified   Party  upon  the  submission  of
     appropriate  invoices and to the full extent  permitted by law, and subject
     to the limitations  described  below and the provision by such  Indemnified
     Party of an  undertaking  to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event
     of  a  final   non-appealable   determination   by  a  court  of  competent
     jurisdiction  that such Indemnified  Party is not entitled to such amounts.
     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Indemnifying  Parties  shall have no
     obligation  hereunder  to any  Indemnified  Party  when  and if a court  of
     competent  jurisdiction shall ultimately determine,  and such determination
     shall have become final and  non-appealable,  that  indemnification of such
     Indemnified  Party in the  manner  contemplated  hereby  is  prohibited  by
     applicable law.

          (ii) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
     Section  5.8,  upon  learning  of any such  claim,  action,  suit,  demand,
     proceeding  or  investigation,  shall  promptly  notify  JP and,  after the
     Effective Time, GGP and GGP Partnership, thereof; provided that the failure
     to so  notify  shall  not  affect  the  obligations  of  JP,  GGP  and  GGP
     Partnership except to the extent such failure to notify


                                       40
<PAGE>

     materially prejudices such party. If any such action is brought against any
     of  the  Indemnified  Parties  and  such  Indemnified  Parties  notify  the
     Indemnifying Parties of its commencement,  the Indemnifying Parties will be
     entitled to participate in and, to the extent that they elect by delivering
     written notice to such Indemnified  Parties promptly after receiving notice
     of the commencement of the action from the Indemnified  Parties,  to assume
     and  control  the  defense  of  the  action  and  after   notice  from  the
     Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnified Parties of their election to assume
     the defense, the Indemnifying Parties will not be liable to the Indemnified
     Parties for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except
     for the  reasonable  costs of  investigation  subsequently  incurred by the
     Indemnified  Parties in connection  with the defense.  If the  Indemnifying
     Parties assume the defense,  the Indemnifying  Parties shall have the right
     to settle such  action  without  the  consent of the  Indemnified  Parties;
     provided,  however,  that the  Indemnifying  Parties  shall be  required to
     obtain such consent (which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld) if
     the  settlement  includes any  admission of  wrongdoing  on the part of the
     Indemnified  Parties  or any  decree  or  restriction  on  the  Indemnified
     Parties;  provided,  further, that no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of
     any such action shall,  except with the consent of the Indemnified  Parties
     (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any
     judgment  or  enter  into  any  settlement  that  does  not  include  as an
     unconditional  term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
     Indemnified  Parties of a release from all  liability  with respect to such
     action.  The  Indemnified  Parties  will have the right to employ their own
     counsel in any such action,  but the fees,  expenses  and other  charges of
     such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified  Parties unless (i)
     the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Parties has been authorized in
     writing by the Indemnifying  Parties, (ii) a conflict or potential conflict
     exists (based on advice of counsel to the Indemnified  Parties) between the
     Indemnified  Parties and the  Indemnifying  Parties (in which event counsel
     for the Indemnified  Partner may participate in the defense of such action)
     or (iii) the  Indemnifying  Parties  have not in fact  employed  counsel to
     assume the defense of such action within a reasonable  time after receiving
     notice  of the  commencement  of the  action,  in each of which  cases  the
     reasonable fees,  disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the
     expense of the Indemnifying Parties.

          (iii) It is  understood  that the  Indemnifying  Parties shall not, in
     connection  with any proceeding or related  proceedings,  be liable for the
     reasonable fees,  disbursements and other charges of more than one separate
     firm at any one time for all such Indemnified Parties.

          (iv) The Indemnifying Parties will not be liable for any settlement of
     any action or claim effected  without their written  consent (which consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld).

     (b) For six years after the Effective Time, GGP and GGP  Partnership  shall
maintain in effect JP's current  directors'  and officers'  liability  insurance
covering  each  person  currently  covered  by  JP's  directors'  and  officers'
liability  insurance  policy  for  acts  or  omissions  occurring  prior  to the
Effective  Time on terms  with  respect  to such  coverage  and  amounts no less
favorable in the  aggregate to such  directors  and officers  than those of such
policy  as in effect on the date of this  Agreement;  provided  that GGP and GGP
Partnership may substitute  therefor  policies of a reputable  insurance company
the terms of which,  including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in the
aggregate to such directors and officers than the insurance  coverage  otherwise
required under this Section 5.8(b);  provided,  however,  that in no event shall
GGP or  GGP  Partnership  be  required  to pay  aggregate  annual  premiums  for
insurance under this Section 5.8(b) in excess of $200,000.00,  provided that GGP
and GGP  Partnership  shall  nevertheless  be obligated to provide such a policy
with the best coverage reasonably available as may be obtained for such amount.

     (c) In the event that GGP, GGP  Partnership  or any of their  successors or
assigns (i)  consolidates  with or merges  into any other  Person and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such


                                       41
<PAGE>

consolidation  or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or  substantially  all
its  properties  and assets to any Person,  then, and in each such case, GGP and
GGP Partnership  shall cause proper  provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of GGP and GGP Partnership  assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.8.

     (d) To the fullest  extent  permitted by law,  from and after the Effective
Time,  all  rights  to  indemnification  as of the date  hereof  in favor of the
directors  and  officers  of JP and the JP  Subsidiaries  with  respect to their
activities as such prior to the Effective  Time, as provided in, with respect to
JP, the JP Articles and the JP Bylaws,  or, with respect to the JP Subsidiaries,
their  respective   certificates  of  incorporation   and  by-laws  (or  similar
organizational  documents) in effect on the date hereof,  or otherwise in effect
on the date hereof,  shall survive the Mergers and shall  continue in full force
indefinitely.

     (e)  The  provisions  of  this  Section  5.8  are  intended  to be for  the
irrevocable  benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her  representatives.  Each  Indemnified  Party shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants under this Section 5.8(e).

     5.9 Declaration of Dividends and Distributions.  From and after the date of
this  Agreement,  JP  shall  not  make  any  dividend  or  distribution  to  its
stockholders  without  the prior  written  consent  of GGP and GGP  Partnership;
provided,  however,  the written consent of GGP and GGP Partnership shall not be
required for the authorization and payment of (a) quarterly  distributions  with
respect to the JP Common  Stock of up to $0.51 per share for the quarter  ending
March 31, 2002 and, if the Closing  occurs after March 31, 2002, up to $0.51 per
share for each full  quarter  thereafter,  with the  dividend for the quarter in
which the Closing  occurs to be prorated  for the number of days in such quarter
elapsed prior to the Closing and (b) quarterly distributions with respect to the
Price  Group Stock of up to $0.408 per share for the  quarter  ending  March 31,
2002 and, if the Closing occurs after March 31, 2002, up to $0.408 per share for
each full  quarter  thereafter,  with the  dividend for the quarter in which the
Closing  occurs to be prorated  for the number of days in such  quarter  elapsed
prior to the  Closing  (each  such per  share  amount  in (b)  being  80% of the
corresponding  per share amount in (a)),  provided  that JP shall notify GGP and
GGP Partnership of the proposed record date for any such  distribution  prior to
such date. From and after the date of this Agreement,  PDC LP shall not make any
distribution  to the holders of PDC OP Units  except (a) a  distribution  per JP
Common OP Unit in the same  amount as a  dividend  per share of JP Common  Stock
permitted  pursuant to this Section 5.9,  with the same record and payment dates
as such dividend on JP Common Stock and (b) quarterly  dividends with respect to
the PDC  Preferred  OP  Units  which  are  required  by the  terms of the PDC LP
Agreement.  The foregoing restrictions shall not apply, however, to the extent a
distribution (or an increase in a distribution) by JP is permitted under Section
1.8(d), or is necessary for JP to maintain REIT status,  avoid the incurrence of
any Taxes under  Section  857 of the Code,  avoid the  imposition  of any excise
Taxes  under  Section  4981 of the  Code,  or avoid the need to make one or more
extraordinary  or  disproportionately  larger  distributions  to meet any of the
three preceding objectives.

     5.10  Resignations.  On the Closing  Date, JP shall cause the directors and
officers of JP and of each of the JP Subsidiaries  to submit their  resignations
from such positions, effective as of the Effective Time.

     5.11 Registration  Rights Agreements.  At the Closing,  JP shall assign and
GGP shall assume by appropriate  instrument the Registration  Rights  Agreements
described  in  Schedule  5.11  to  the  JP  Disclosure  Letter  relating  to the
registration  rights granted to the holders of PDC Series A OP Units, PDC Series
B OP Units and PDC Series C OP Units.


                                       42
<PAGE>

     5.12 Information Supplied. None of JP, PDC LP, GGP or GGP Partnership shall
supply  information  for  inclusion or  incorporation  by reference in the Proxy
Statement or in the Partner Solicitation Materials that will, at the date mailed
to JP  stockholders,  at  the  time  of the JP  Stockholders  Meeting  or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

     5.13 The JP Rights Plan. JP shall either (i) redeem, effective immediately,
prior to the Effective Time, all of the then  outstanding  Rights (as defined in
the Rights  Agreement) for cash pursuant to and in compliance with Section 23 of
the Rights  Agreement  or (ii) take such other  action to  terminate  the Rights
Agreement as of that time, as JP and GGP may mutually agree. JP shall not redeem
the Rights issued under the Rights Agreement, or terminate the Rights Agreement,
prior to the Effective  Time of the Merger  (other than in  accordance  with the
preceding   sentence)  unless  required  to  do  so  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction;  provided,  however, that JP may take any of the foregoing actions
if the Board of  Directors  of JP shall have  accepted a proposal for a Superior
Competing Transaction in accordance with the terms of Section 4.2.

     5.14 Noncompetition Agreements. At or prior to Closing, JP shall cause John
Price and the  individuals  identified  in  Schedule  5.14 to the JP  Disclosure
Schedule   to  enter  into   noncompetition   and   confidentiality   agreements
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K.

                                   ARTICLE 6

                                   CONDITIONS

     6.1  Conditions  to Each  Party's  Obligation  to Effect  the  Merger.  The
obligations  of each party to effect the  Mergers  and to  consummate  the other
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement to occur on the Closing Date shall
be subject to the  fulfillment  at or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

     (a) JP Stockholder and Partner Approvals.  The JP Stockholder  Approval and
JP Partner Approvals shall have been obtained.

     (b)  No  Injunctions  or  Restraints.   No  temporary   restraining  order,
preliminary  or  permanent  injunction  or other  order  issued  by any court of
competent  jurisdiction or other legal  restraint or prohibition  preventing the
consummation of the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be in effect.

     6.2  Conditions to  Obligations of GGP, GGP  Partnership,  Acquisition  and
Partnership  Acquisition.  The obligations of GGP, GGP Partnership,  Acquisition
and Acquisition  Partnership Acquisition to effect the Mergers and to consummate
the other  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement to occur on the Closing
Date are further subject to the following  conditions,  any one or more of which
may be waived by GGP and GGP Partnership:

     (a)  Representations  and  Warranties.  Each  of  the  representations  and
warranties  of JP and PDC LP set forth in this  Agreement  which is qualified by
materiality  shall be true and  correct,  and  each of the  representations  and
warranties  of JP  and  PDC LP set  forth  in  this  Agreement  which  is not so
qualified shall be true and correct in all material  respects,  in each case, as
of the date of this  Agreement  and as of the Closing Date as though made on and
as of the  Closing  Date  (except to the extent  that such  representations  and
warranties  are expressly  limited by their terms to another date, in which case
such  representations  and warranties shall be true and correct as of such other
date). This condition shall be


                                       43
<PAGE>

deemed to have been  satisfied  unless all breaches of the  representations  and
warranties  of JP and PDC LP in this  Agreement  (without  giving  effect to any
materiality,  any JP Material  Adverse  Effect or any similar  qualification  or
limitation)  would,  in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to  have a JP
Material  Adverse  Effect.  GGP  and  GGP  Partnership  shall  have  received  a
certificate  (which certificate may be qualified by knowledge to the same extent
as such  representations and warranties are so qualified) signed on behalf of JP
by the chief executive  officer and the chief  financial  officer of JP, in such
capacities, to such effect.

     (b)  Performance  of Obligations of JP and PDC LP. JP and PDC LP shall have
performed in all material  respects all obligations  required to be performed by
them under this  Agreement at or prior to the  Effective  Time,  and GGP and GGP
Partnership  shall  have  received a  certificate  signed on behalf of JP by the
chief  executive  officer  and  the  chief  financial  officer  of JP,  in  such
capacities, to such effect.

     (c) Material Adverse Change. Since the date of this Agreement,  there shall
have  been  no JP  Material  Adverse  Effect,  and GGP  shall  have  received  a
certificate of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of JP, in
such capacities, certifying to such effect.

     (d) Tax Opinions  Relating to REIT Status and Partnership  Status.  GGP and
GGP Partnership shall have received an opinion of Clifford Chance Rogers & Wells
LLP or other counsel to JP reasonably  satisfactory to GGP and GGP  Partnership,
dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that,  (i) for all taxable years for
which the Internal  Revenue Service could assert a Tax liability with respect to
JP, JP was organized and has operated in conformity  with the  requirements  for
qualification  and  taxation as a REIT under the Code,  and (ii) for all taxable
years for which the Internal  Revenue  Service could assert a Tax liability with
respect to PDC LP, PDC LP has been,  and  continues  to be,  treated for federal
income tax purposes as a  partnership  and not as a corporation  or  association
taxable  as  a  corporation   (with   customary   exceptions,   assumptions  and
qualifications and based upon customary  representations).  For purposes of such
opinion,  Clifford  Chance  Rogers  & Wells  LLP may  rely  on (in  addition  to
customary assumptions and representations for opinions of this type) assumptions
to the effect that (A) Code Section  562(e) applies to the deemed sale of assets
by JP pursuant to the Merger in computing the earnings and profits of JP for the
taxable year ending on the Closing Date, (B) that the Merger will be treated for
federal  income tax  purposes  in the manner  described  in  paragraph  G of the
Recitals  hereof,  and (C) no action will be taken following the Mergers that is
inconsistent with JP's status as a REIT for any period prior to the Mergers.

     (e)  Consents.  The  consents  (or  waivers  of such  consents)  from third
parties,  specified in Schedule  6.2(e) of the JP  Disclosure  Letter shall have
been obtained and remain in full force and effect.

     6.3 Conditions to  Obligations of JP and PDC LP. The  obligations of JP and
PDC  LP  to  effect  the  Mergers  and  to  consummate  the  other  transactions
contemplated  to occur on the Closing Date is further  subject to the  following
conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by JP and PDC LP:

     (a)  Representations  and  Warranties.  Each  of  the  representations  and
warranties of GGP, GGP Partnership,  Acquisition and Partnership Acquisition set
forth in this  Agreement  which is  qualified by  materiality  shall be true and
correct, and each of the representations and warranties of GGP, GGP Partnership,
Acquisition and Partnership Acquisition set forth in this Agreement which is not
so qualified shall be true and correct in all material  respects,  in each case,
as of the date of this  Agreement  and as of the Closing  Date as though made on
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent that such  representations  and
warranties  are expressly  limited by their terms to another date, in which case
such  representations  and warranties shall be true and correct as of such other
date). This condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied unless all breaches
of the representations and warranties of GGP and GGP


                                       44
<PAGE>

Partnership  in this Agreement  (without  giving effect to any  materiality,  JP
Material Adverse Effect or any similar  qualification  or limitation)  would, in
the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a GGP Material Adverse Effect. JP
shall  have  received a  certificate  (which  certificate  may be  qualified  by
knowledge  to the same  extent as such  representations  and  warranties  are so
qualified)  signed on behalf of GGP by a duly authorized  representative of GGP,
in such capacity, to such effect.

     (b)  Performance of Obligations of GGP, GGP  Partnership,  Acquisition  and
Partnership  Acquisition.  GGP, GGP  Partnership,  Acquisition  and  Partnership
Acquisition  shall have  performed  in all  material  respects  all  obligations
required  to be  performed  by them  under  this  Agreement  at or  prior to the
Effective Time, and JP shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of GGP
by a duly authorized representative of GGP, in such capacity, to such effect.

     (c)  Tax  Opinions   Relating  to  REIT  Status  and  Partnership   Status.
Contributing  Holders of PDC Common OP Units  shall have  received an opinion of
Neal,  Gerber & Eisenberg or other  counsel to GGP  reasonably  satisfactory  to
Contributing  Holders of PDC Common OP Units,  dated as of the Closing  Date, to
the  effect  that,  (i) for all  taxable  years for which the  Internal  Revenue
Service could assert a Tax liability  with respect to GGP, GGP was organized and
operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT  under  the Code,  and (ii) for all  taxable  years for which the  Internal
Revenue  Service could assert a Tax liability  with respect to GGP  Partnership,
GGP  Partnership  has been,  and continues to be, treated for federal income tax
purposes as a partnership  and not as a corporation or association  taxable as a
corporation (with customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and based
upon customary representations).

                                   ARTICLE 7

                TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER; BOARD ACTIONS

     7.1 Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time of the Partnership  Merger,  whether such action occurs before or
after any of the JP Stockholder Approval or JP Partner Approvals are obtained:

     (a) by mutual written  consent duly authorized by the Board of Directors of
JP and GGP;

     (b) by GGP and GGP  Partnership,  or upon a breach of or failure to perform
any representation,  warranty, covenant,  obligation or agreement on the part of
JP or PDC LP set forth in this Agreement,  or if any  representation or warranty
of JP or PDC LP shall become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set
forth in  Section  6.2(a)  or  Section  6.2(b),  as the  case  may be,  would be
incapable  of being  satisfied  by July 31,  2002 (or as  otherwise  extended by
mutual agreement of the parties hereto);

     (c)  by JP  upon  a  breach  of  any  representation,  warranty,  covenant,
obligation  or  agreement on the part of GGP, GGP  Partnership,  Acquisition  or
Partnership Acquisition set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of GGP, GGP Partnership,  Acquisition or Partnership  Acquisition shall
become  untrue,  in either  case such that the  conditions  set forth in Section
6.3(a)  or  Section  6.3(b),  as the case may be,  would be  incapable  of being
satisfied by July 31, 2002 (or as otherwise  extended by mutual agreement of the
parties hereto);

     (d) by either GGP,  GGP  Partnership  or JP, if any  judgment,  injunction,
order,  decree or  action by any  Governmental  Entity  of  competent  authority
preventing  the  consummation  of  the  Mergers  shall  have  become  final  and
non-appealable; provided, however, that a party may not terminate


                                       45
<PAGE>

pursuant  to this  clause (d) if the  terminating  party  shall have  materially
breached its obligations under this Agreement;

     (e) by either GGP,  GGP  Partnership  or JP, if the Mergers  shall not have
been consummated before July 31, 2002; provided,  however,  that a party may not
terminate  pursuant  to this  clause  (e) if the  terminating  party  shall have
materially breached its obligations under this Agreement;

     (f) by either GGP, GGP Partnership or JP, if, upon a vote at a duly held JP
Stockholders  Meeting or any adjournment  thereof,  the JP Stockholder  Approval
shall not have been  obtained as  contemplated  by Section 5.1 or the JP Partner
Approvals shall not have been obtained as contemplated by Section 5.1;

     (g) by JP, if the Board of Directors of JP shall have withdrawn,  modified,
amended  or  qualified  in any  manner  adverse  to GGP or GGP  Partnership  its
approval  or  recommendation  of  either of the  Mergers  or this  Agreement  in
connection with, or approved or recommended,  any Superior Competing Transaction
in compliance with the provisions of Sections 4.2 and 4.3; and

     (h) by GGP or GGP Partnership,  if (i) prior to the JP Stockholder Meeting,
the Board of  Directors  of JP or any  committee  thereof  shall have  failed to
recommend or withdrawn,  modified, amended or qualified in any manner adverse to
GGP or GGP  Partnership  its approval or  recommendation  of the Mergers or this
Agreement,  or approved or recommended any Superior Competing Transaction,  (ii)
JP or PDC LP shall have entered into any agreement with respect to any Competing
Transaction or (iii) the Board of Directors of JP or any committee thereof shall
have resolved or publicly disclosed its intent to do any of the foregoing.

     7.2 Certain  Fees,  Expenses and Rights.  If this  Agreement is  terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(b), then JP and PDC LP shall be jointly liable to pay to
GGP  Partnership  an  amount  equal to the GGP  Break-Up  Expenses  (as  defined
herein).  If this Agreement shall be (i) terminated  pursuant to Section 7.1(b),
7.1(e) (if JP shall have exercised such termination right) or 7.1(f), and (A) on
or after  January  31,  2002 and prior to such  termination  a Person has made a
proposal relating to a Competing Transaction and (B) within one year of any such
termination JP shall consummate a Competing  Transaction or execute a definitive
agreement  providing for a  transaction  or series of  transactions  which would
otherwise constitute a Competing Transaction (a "JP Acquisition Agreement") with
such Person or its  Affiliates or  associates or Persons  acting in concert with
such Person  (whether or not any JP  Acquisition  Agreement  relates to the same
Competing  Transaction which had been received at the time of the termination of
this Agreement) or (ii) terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or 7.1(h), then JP
and PDC LP shall be jointly liable to pay to GGP  Partnership an amount equal to
the GGP Break-Up Fee (as defined below) less any GGP Break-Up Expenses otherwise
to be paid hereunder.

     The  payment of the GGP  Break-Up  Fee or GGP  Break-Up  Expenses  shall be
compensation  for the loss suffered by GGP, GGP Partnership and their Affiliates
as a result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated (including,  without
limitation, opportunity costs and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) and to avoid
the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances.  The GGP Break-Up
Fee shall be paid by JP to GGP Partnership,  or the GGP Break-Up  Expenses shall
be paid by JP to GGP Partnership,  in immediately available funds within two (2)
business  days after the date the event  giving rise to the  obligation  to make
such payment occurred.  JP and PDC LP acknowledge that the agreements  contained
in this Section 7.2 are integral  parts of this  Agreement;  accordingly,  if JP
fails to promptly pay the GGP Break-Up Fee or GGP Break-Up Expenses due pursuant
to this  Section 7.2 and,  in order to obtain  payment,  GGP or GGP  Partnership
commences  a suit  which  results  in a  judgment  against  JP or PDC LP for any
amounts  owed  pursuant  to this  Section  7.2,  JP and PDC LP shall  pay to GGP
Partnership  its costs and expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit.


                                       46
<PAGE>

As used in this  Agreement,  "GGP  Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to the
lesser  of (i)  $19,000,000  (the  "Base  Amount")  and  (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to GGP  Partnership  without causing GGP to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not  constitute  income  described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A)-(H)  and  856(c)(3)(A)-(I)  of the Code ("Qualifying  Income"),  as
determined by  independent  accountants  to GGP, and (B) in the event GGP or GGP
Partnership  receives a letter from its outside  counsel (the "GGP  Break-Up Fee
Tax Opinion") or a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS
GGP  Break-Up Fee Ruling")  stating that GGP  Partnership's  receipt of the Base
Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income of GGP within the meaning of Sections  856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the
"REIT  Requirements")  or that the receipt by GGP  Partnership  of the remaining
balance of the Base Amount  following  the  receipt of and  pursuant to such GGP
Break-Up  Fee Tax Opinion or IRS GGP  Break-Up Fee Ruling would not cause GGP to
be deemed to have constructively  received such remaining balance prior thereto,
the Base Amount less the amount  payable  under  clause (A) above.  In the event
that GGP Partnership is not able to receive the full Base Amount, JP shall place
the unpaid  amount in escrow and shall not release  any  portion  thereof to GGP
Partnership unless and until JP receives one of the following: (i) a letter from
GGP's or GGP Partnership's independent accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid at that time to GGP Partnership  without causing GGP to fail to
meet the REIT Requirements,  (ii) a GGP Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or (iii) a copy
of the IRS GGP Break-Up  Fee Ruling,  in any of which events JP shall pay to GGP
Partnership the lesser of the unpaid Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in
the letter  referred to in (i) above.  JP's obligation to pay any unpaid portion
of the GGP  Break-Up  Fee  shall  terminate  three  years  from the date of this
Agreement  (and any  amounts  still  held in escrow  shall be  released  to JP).
Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the penultimate  sentence
of this paragraph,  there is no limitation on the number of  distributions  that
can be made from the escrow prior to the third anniversary of this Agreement.

     The "GGP Break-Up  Expenses"  payable to GGP Partnership shall be an amount
equal to the  lesser of (i)  $2,000,000  and (ii)  GGP's  and GGP  Partnership's
out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with this  Agreement  and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all attorneys',
accountants'  and investment  bankers' fees and  expenses).  If the GGP Break-Up
Expenses  payable to GGP Partnership  exceed the maximum amount that can be paid
to GGP  Partnership  without  causing  GGP to fail to meet the  requirements  of
Sections  856(c)(2)  and (3) of the Code  determined  as if the  payment of such
amount did not  constitute  Qualifying  Income,  as  determined  by  independent
accountants to GGP (the "Maximum  Amount"),  the amount initially payable to GGP
Partnership  shall be limited to the Maximum  Amount.  If,  however,  within the
three-year  period  commencing  on  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  GGP  or GGP
Partnership  receives a letter from its outside counsel ("GGP Break-Up  Expenses
Tax Opinion") or a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS
GGP Break-Up Expenses Ruling") stating that GGP Partnership's receipt of the GGP
Break-Up Expenses would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from GGP's  gross  income  within the meaning of the REIT  Requirements  or that
receipt by GGP Partnership of the remaining balance of the GGP Break-Up Expenses
above the  Maximum  Amount  following  the  receipt of and  pursuant to such GGP
Break-Up  Expenses  Tax Opinion or IRS GGP  Break-Up  Expenses  Ruling would not
cause GGP to be deemed to have  constructively  received such remaining  balance
prior thereto,  GGP Partnership shall be entitled to have payable to it the full
amount of the GGP Break-Up  Expenses.  In the event that GGP  Partnership is not
able to receive the full GGP Break-Up Expenses, JP shall place the unpaid amount
in escrow and shall not release any portion  thereof to GGP  Partnership  unless
and until JP receives one of the  following:  (i) a letter from the  independent
accountants of GGP or GGP Partnership  indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid at that time to GGP  Partnership  without  causing  GGP to fail to meet the
REIT  Requirements,  (ii) a GGP Break-Up Expenses Tax Opinion or (iii) a copy of
the IRS GGP Break-Up Expenses Ruling, in any of which events JP shall pay to GGP
Partnership the lesser of the unpaid GGP Break-Up Expenses or the maximum amount
stated in the letter referred to in (i) above. The


                                       47
<PAGE>

obligation of JP to pay any unpaid  portion of the GGP Break-Up  Expenses  shall
terminate three years from the date of this  Agreement.  Subject to satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in the penultimate sentence of this paragraph, there
is no limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from the escrow
prior to the third anniversary of this Agreement.

     If this Agreement shall be terminated  pursuant to Section 7.1(c), then GGP
and GGP  Partnership  thereupon  shall be jointly  liable to pay to JP an amount
equal to the  lesser  of (i)  $2,000,000  and (ii) JP's  out-of-pocket  expenses
incurred in connection  with this  Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated
hereby  (including,   without  limitation,  all  attorneys',   accountants'  and
investment  bankers'  fees and  expenses)  (the  "JP  Break-Up  Expenses").  GGP
acknowledges that if JP commences a suit which results in a judgment against GGP
or GGP  Partnership  for any amounts owed  pursuant to this Section 7.2, GGP and
GGP Partnership  shall be jointly and severally  liable to JP for JP's costs and
expenses (including  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit.

     The foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2 have been agreed to by each of
the  parties  hereto in order to induce  the other  parties  to enter  into this
Agreement and to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions  contemplated
by this  Agreement,  it being agreed and  acknowledged  by each of them that the
execution  of  this   Agreement  by  them   constitutes   full  and   reasonable
consideration for such provisions.

     7.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either JP, GGP or GGP  Partnership  as provided in Section 7.1,  this  Agreement
shall  forthwith  become  void and have no  effect,  without  any  liability  or
obligation  on the part of JP, PDC LP,  GGP,  GGP  Partnership,  Acquisition  or
Partnership Acquisition, other than Section 7.2, this Section 7.3 and Article 8,
and except to the extent that such termination  results from a willful breach by
any party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this  Agreement or a failure or refusal by such party to consummate the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  when such  party was  obligated  to do so in
accordance with the terms hereof.

     7.4  Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by
the Board of  Directors of JP (on behalf of itself and PDC LP) or GGP (on behalf
of itself, GGP Partnership, Acquisition and Partnership Acquisition) at any time
before  or after  any JP  Partners  Approvals  or JP  Stockholder  Approval  are
obtained and prior to the filing of the Maryland  Articles of Merger  and/or the
Maryland Articles of Partnership  Merger with the Department and/or the Delaware
Certificate  of Merger with the  Secretary of State;  provided,  however,  that,
after the JP Partner Approvals and JP Stockholder Approval are obtained, no such
amendment,  modification  or supplement  shall be made which by law requires the
further  approval of  stockholders  or partners  without  obtaining such further
approval.  The parties agree to amend this  Agreement in the manner  provided in
the immediately preceding sentence to the extent required to continue the status
of each of JP and GGP as a REIT. Acquisition and Partnership  Acquisition hereby
agree that any consent or waiver of compliance  given by GGP and GGP Partnership
hereunder shall be conclusively binding on each of them, whether given expressly
or on its behalf.

     7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
may (a) extend the time for the  performance of any of the  obligations or other
acts  of  the  other  party  or  parties,  (b)  waive  any  inaccuracies  in the
representations  and warranties of the other party or parties  contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject
to the proviso of Section 7.4,  waive  compliance  with any of the agreements or
conditions  of the other  party or  parties  contained  in this  Agreement.  Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such  extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an  instrument  in writing  signed on behalf of such party.
The  failure of any party to this  Agreement  to assert any of its rights  under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS,  a Delaware limited  partnership known as GGP Limited  Partnership
(the "Partnership")  exists pursuant to that certain Second Amended and Restated

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the mutual covenants and agreements
herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration,  the receipt and

as follows:

     1.  Capitalized  Terms.  Capitalized  terms  used  but not  defined  herein
(including without limitation in attached Schedule A) shall have the definitions

     2. Additional  Definitions.  Section 1.1 of the Second Restated Partnership
Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the following new definitions:

<PAGE>

            "Aggregate  Protected  Amount"  shall  mean,  with  respect  to  the
      Obligated  Partners,  as a group,  the  aggregate  amount of the Protected
      Amounts, if any, of the Obligated  Partners,  as determined on the date in

            "Indirect Owner" means, in the case of an Obligated  Partner that is
      an entity that is classified as a partnership  or  disregarded  entity for
      federal income tax purposes,  any person owning an equity interest in such
      Obligated  Partner,  and, in the case of any Indirect Owner that itself is
      an entity that is classified as a partnership  or  disregarded  entity for
      federal income tax purposes,  any person owning an equity interest in such
      entity.

            "Obligated Partner" shall mean that or those Limited Partners listed
      as Obligated Partners on Exhibit D attached hereto and made a part hereof,
      as such Exhibit may be amended  from time to time by the General  Partner,
      whether  by express  amendment  to this  Agreement  or by  execution  of a
      written  instrument by and between any additional  Obligated Partner being
      directly  affected thereby and the General Partner acting on behalf of the
      Partnership  and without the prior consent of the Limited  Partners (other
      than the Obligated Partners being affected thereby).

            "Partner  Nonrecourse  Debt"  shall mean a  liability  as defined in
      Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(4).

            "Protected  Amount"  shall  mean,  with  respect  to  any  Obligated
      Partner,  the amount set forth opposite the name of such Obligated Partner
      on Exhibit D hereto and made a part hereof, as such Exhibit may be amended

      being affected  thereby and the General  Partner,  acting on behalf of the
      Partnership  and without the prior consent of the Limited  Partners (other
      than the Obligated  Partners being affected thereby);  provided,  however,
      that,  in the  case of an  Obligated  Partner  that is an  entity  that is
      classified as a partnership or  disregarded  entity for federal income tax
      purposes,  upon the date nine months after the death of any Indirect Owner
      in such Obligated Partner, or upon a fully taxable sale or exchange of all
      of an Indirect Owner's equity interest in such Obligated  Partner (i.e., a
      sale or exchange in which the  transferee's  basis in the Indirect Owner's
      equity interest in the Obligated Partner is not determined, in whole or in
      part,  by  reference  to the  Indirect  Owner's  basis  in  the  Obligated
      Partner),  the Protected Amount of such Obligated Partner shall be reduced
      to the extent of the Indirect  Owner's  allocable  share of the  Obligated
      Partner's Protected Amount. The principles of the preceding sentence shall
      apply in the same manner in the case of any Indirect  Owner that itself is
      an entity that is classified as a partnership  or  disregarded  entity for
      federal income tax purposes..

            "Recourse  Liabilities" shall mean, as of the date of determination,

Preferred  Units  designated  as  the  "8.5%  Series  B  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred  Units" (the  "Series B Preferred  Units") is hereby  established  and
shall have such rights, preferences,


                                      -2-

limitations and  qualifications  as are described on Schedule A, attached hereto
and  by  this  reference  made  a  part  hereof  (in  addition  to  the  rights,
preferences,  limitations  and  qualifications  contained in the Second Restated
Partnership  Agreement  to  the  extent  applicable).  Pursuant  to  the  Merger
Agreement,  the Partnership hereby issues to each New Limited Partner the number
of Series B Preferred  Units set forth  opposite its name on Exhibit A, attached
hereto and by this  reference  made a part hereof.  Each New Limited  Partner is
hereby  admitted as a Limited Partner in respect of the Series B Preferred Units
issued to it,  and such New  Limited  Partner  hereby  agrees to be bound by the
provisions of the Second Restated Partnership Agreement,  as the same is amended
hereby and as the same may be amended  from time to time,  with  respect to such
Series B  Preferred  Units  (including  without  limitation  the  provisions  of
Sections 8.2, 8.4, 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 thereof).

     4. Negative Capital Accounts. The following new Section 7.8 is hereby added
to the Second Restated Partnership Agreement:

          "7.8 Negative Capital Accounts.

          (a) Except as provided in the next  sentence  and Section  7.8(b),  no
     Partner shall be liable to the  Partnership or to any other partner for any
     deficit or negative  balance which may exist in its Capital  Account.  Upon
     liquidation of any Obligated Partner's interest in the Partnership, whether
     pursuant to a liquidation of the  Partnership or by means of a distribution
     to the Obligated Partner by the Partnership,  if such Obligated Partner has
     a deficit  balance  in its  Capital  Account,  after  giving  effect to all
     contributions,   distributions,  allocations  and  adjustments  to  Capital
     Accounts for all periods,  each such Obligated  Partner shall contribute to
     the capital of the  Partnership an amount equal to its  respective  deficit
     balance.  Each  Obligated  Partner  having such an  obligation to restore a
     deficit  Capital  Account shall  satisfy such  obligation by the end of the
     fiscal year of liquidation (or, if later, within ninety (90) days following
     the liquidation and dissolution of the Partnership).  Any such contribution
     by an Obligated  Partner shall be used to make payments to creditors of the
     Partnership and such Obligated  Partners (i) shall not be subrogated to the
     rights of any such creditor against the General  Partner,  the Partnership,
     another Partner,  or any Person related thereto,  and (ii) hereby waive any
     right to  reimbursement,  contribution  or  similar  right  to  which  such
     Obligated  Partners  might  otherwise  be  entitled  as  a  result  of  the
     performance of their obligations under this Agreement.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Agreement,   an
     Obligated  Partner shall cease to be an Obligated  Partner upon the earlier

     months  after (A) any date  after the  third  anniversary  date of the date
     hereof  which is selected by the  Obligated  Partner as the date upon which
     such Obligated  Partner's  obligation  hereunder  shall  terminate (and for
     which  notice  of such date  shall be given at least 60 days  prior to such
     selected  date)  or (B) an  exchange  of all of  such  Obligated  Partner's
     remaining  Units for shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (pursuant to
     a Rights  Agreement) or in an otherwise  taxable sale or exchange of all of
     such Obligated Partner's Units provided that at the time of, or during such
     six-month  period  following  such event set forth in (ii)(A) or (B), there
     has not been:  (X) an entry of a decree or order for  relief in  respect of
     the Partnership by a court having


                                      -3-

     jurisdiction  over a substantial part of the  Partnership's  assets, or the
     appointment  of  a  receiver,  liquidator,  assignee,  custodian,  trustee,
     sequestrator  (or other  similar  official)  of the  Partnership  or of any
     substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation
     of the  Partnership's  affairs,  in an  involuntary  case under the federal
     bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter  constituted,  or any other applicable
     federal or state  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or other similar law; or (Y) the
     commencement  against  the  Partnership  of an  involuntary  case under the
     federal  bankruptcy  laws,  as now or hereafter  constituted,  or any other
     applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; or
     (Z) the  commencement  by the  Partnership  of a  voluntary  case under the
     federal  bankruptcy  laws,  as now or hereafter  constituted,  or any other
     applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or
     the  consent  by it to the entry of an order for  relief in an  involuntary
     case  under  any such law or the  consent  by it to the  appointment  of or
     taking possession by a receiver, liquidator,  assignee, custodian, trustee,
     sequestrator  (or other  similar  official)  of the  Partnership  or of any
     substantial  part  of  its  property,  or  the  making  by it of a  general
     assignment for the benefit of creditors,  or the failure of the Partnership
     generally  to pay its debts as such  debts  become due or the taking of any
     action in furtherance of any of the foregoing. Following the passage of the
     six-month period after the event set forth in clause (ii)(A) or (B) of this
     paragraph,  an Obligated  Partner shall cease to be an Obligated Partner at
     the first time, if any, that all of the conditions set forth in (X) through
     (Z) above are no longer in existence."

     5. New Exhibit A. Exhibit A to the Second Restated  Partnership  Agreement,
identifying the Partners, the number of Units owned by them and their respective
Percentage Interests,  if any, is hereby deleted in its entirety and the Exhibit

Units:  (X) the occurrence of any Event so long as either (1) the Partnership is

                                      A-2
<PAGE>

     For purposes of the  foregoing  provisions of this Section 4, each Series B

     5. Distributions.

     (a) With respect to each  Distribution  Period and subject to the rights of
the holders of Preferred  Units ranking senior to or on parity with the Series B
Preferred  Units,  the holders of Series B Preferred  Units shall be entitled to
receive,  when, as and if declared by the General Partner,  out of assets of the
Partnership  legally  available  for the  payment  of  distributions,  quarterly
cumulative cash  distributions in an amount per Series B Preferred Unit equal to
the greater of (i) $1.0625  and (ii) the amount of the  regular  quarterly  cash
distribution  for such  Distribution  Period upon the number of Common Units (or
portion  thereof) into which such Series B Preferred Unit is then convertible in
accordance  with  Section  7 of  this  Schedule  A  (but,  with  respect  to any
Distribution Period ending after the Fifteenth Anniversary Date, no amount shall
be paid in respect of clause (ii) of this paragraph in respect of the portion of
such  Distribution  Period  occurring  after the  Fifteenth  Anniversary  Date).
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  contained  herein,  the  amount  of
distributions  described  under either clause (i) or (ii) of this  paragraph for
the  initial  Distribution  Period,  or any  other  period  shorter  than a full
Distribution  Period,  shall be  prorated  and  computed  on the basis of twelve
30-day months and a 360-day year. The distributions  upon the Series B Preferred
Units for each  Distribution  Period  shall,  if and to the extent  declared  or
authorized  by the  General  Partner  on behalf of the  Partnership,  be paid in
arrears (without interest or other amount) on the Distribution Payment Date with
respect thereto, and, if not paid on such date, shall accumulate, whether or not
there are funds  legally  available  for the payment  thereof and whether or not
such distributions are declared or authorized. The record date for distributions
upon the Series B Preferred Units for any Distribution  Period shall be the same
as the  record  date  for the  distributions  upon  the  Common  Units  for such
Distribution  Period  (or, if no such  record is set for the Common  Units,  the
fifteenth day of the calendar month in which the applicable Distribution Payment
Date falls).  Accumulated  and unpaid  distributions  for any past  Distribution
Periods  may  be  declared  and  paid  at any  time,  without  reference  to any
Distribution  Payment Date, to holders of record on such date,  not exceeding 45
days preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the General Partner.
Any  distribution  payment made upon the Series B Preferred Units shall first be
credited  against the earliest  accumulated  but unpaid  distributions  due with
respect to such Units which  remains  payable.  No interest,  or sum of money in
lieu of  interest,  shall be owing or payable  in  respect  of any  distribution
payment or payments on the Series B Preferred Units, whether or not in arrears.

     (b) No  distribution  on the Series B Preferred  Units shall be declared by
the General  Partner or paid or set apart for payment by the Partnership at such
time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Partnership,  including
any agreement relating to its indebtedness,  prohibits such declaration, payment
or setting  apart for  payment or  provides  that such  declaration,  payment or
setting  apart for  payment  would  constitute  a breach  thereof,  or a default
thereunder,  or if such declaration or payment shall be restricted or prohibited
by law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  distributions on the Series B Preferred
Units shall accumulate whether or not any of the foregoing restrictions exist.


                                      A-3
<PAGE>

     (c) Except as provided in Section  5(d) of this  Schedule A, so long as any
Series B Preferred Units are outstanding,  (i) no  distributions  (other than in
Common Units or other Units ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Units as to
payment of distributions and amounts upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Partnership)  shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon the
Common  Units or any  other  class or  series of  partnership  interests  in the
Partnership  or  Units  ranking,  as to  payment  of  distributions  or  amounts
distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Partnership, on
a parity with or junior to the Series B Preferred Units, for any period and (ii)
no Common Units or other Units ranking  junior to or on a parity with the Series
B Preferred Units as to payment of  distributions  or amounts upon  liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the  Partnership,  shall be redeemed,  purchased or
otherwise  acquired  for any  consideration  (or any  monies  be paid to or made
available  for a  sinking  fund for the  redemption  of any such  Units)  by the
Partnership  (except by  conversion  into or exchange  for other  Units  ranking
junior to the  Series B  Preferred  Units as to  payment  of  distributions  and
amounts upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding-up of the  Partnership or by
redemptions  pursuant to Rights Agreements) unless, in the case of either clause
(i) or (ii), full cumulative  distributions have been or  contemporaneously  are
declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient  for the payment  thereof set
apart for such  payment on the  Series B  Preferred  Units for all  Distribution
Periods ending on or prior to the distribution payment date for the Common Units
or such other class or series of Unit or the date of such  redemption,  purchase
or other acquisition.

     (d) When  distributions  are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such
full  payment is not set apart for such  payment)  upon the  Series B  Preferred
Units and any other partnership interests in the Partnership or Units ranking on
a parity as to payment of  distributions  with the Series B Preferred Units, all
distributions  declared  upon  the  Series  B  Preferred  Units  and  any  other
partnership  interests  in the  Partnership  or Units  ranking on a parity as to
payment of distributions with the Series B Preferred Units shall be declared pro
rata so that the amount of distributions declared per Unit of Series B Preferred
Units and such other partnership  interests in the Partnership or Units shall in
all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued  distributions per Unit
on the Series B  Preferred  Units and such other  partnership  interests  in the
Partnership  or Units  (which shall not include any  accumulation  in respect of
unpaid  distributions for prior  distribution  periods if such Units do not have
cumulative distributions) bear to each other.

     (e)  Holders  of Series B  Preferred  Units  shall not be  entitled  to any
distributions,  whether  payable in cash,  property  or Units,  in excess of the
cumulative distributions described in Section 5(a) above.

     (f) Distributions with respect to the Series B Preferred Units are intended
to  qualify  as  permitted  distributions  of cash  that  are not  treated  as a
disguised  sale  within the meaning of Treasury  Regulation  ss.1.707-4  and the
provisions of this Schedule A shall be construed and applied  consistently  with
such Treasury Regulations.

     (g) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject
to the last sentence of Section 5(a) hereof),  if the distributions with respect
to the Series B Preferred  Units made on or prior to the second  anniversary  of
the  issuance  of the Series B  Preferred  Units  would  result in any holder of
Series B Preferred Units receiving an annual return on such holder's


                                      A-4
<PAGE>

"unreturned  capital"  (as defined for purposes of Treasury  Regulation  Section
1.707-4(a))  for a fiscal  year  (treating  the fiscal year in which such second
anniversary occurs as ending on such date) in excess of the Safe Harbor Rate (as
defined  below),  then the  distributions  to such holder in excess of such Safe
Harbor Rate will be  deferred,  will  cumulate  and will be paid,  if and to the
extent  declared  or  authorized  by  the  General  Partner  on  behalf  of  the
Partnership and subject to the provisions of Section 5(b) hereof, on the earlier
to occur of (i) the  disposition  of the Series B Preferred  Units to which such
deferred  distributions  relate in a transaction  in which the disposing  holder
recognizes taxable gain thereon or (ii) the first distribution payment date with
respect to the Series B Preferred Units following the second  anniversary of the
issuance of the Series B Preferred  Units.  For purposes of the  foregoing,  the
"Safe  Harbor  Rate" shall equal 150% of the highest  applicable  federal  rate,
based on quarterly compounding, in effect for purposes of Section 1274(d) of the
Code at any time  between  the date of the  issuance  of the Series B  Preferred
Units  and the  date  on  which  the  relevant  distribution  payment  is  made.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained  herein,  any distributions
that are deferred  under this section  shall be deemed to have been paid in full
for  purposes of Sections  5(c) and (d) of this  Schedule A until the end of the
Dividend Period during which they are to be paid as provided above.

     (h) For any quarterly period, any amounts paid with respect to the Series B
Preferred  Units in excess of the amount that would have been paid with  respect
to such  Units for such  period had they been  converted  into  Common  Units in
accordance  with the  terms of  Section 7 of this  Schedule  A are  intended  to
constitute  guaranteed payments within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code
and shall not be treated as distributions  for purposes of allocating Net Income
and Net Loss or otherwise maintaining Capital Accounts.

     6. Liquidation Preference.

     (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution
or  winding-up of the  Partnership,  before any payment or  distribution  of the
assets of the Partnership  (whether  capital or surplus) shall be made to or set
apart for the holders of Common Units or any other partnership  interests in the
Partnership  or Units ranking  junior to the Series B Preferred  Units as to the
distribution  of assets upon the  liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of the
Partnership,  the holders of the Series B Preferred Units shall, with respect to
each such Unit,  be entitled to  receive,  out of the assets of the  Partnership
available for distribution to Partners after payment or provision for payment of
all debts and  other  liabilities  of the  Partnership,  an amount  equal to the
greater of (i) $50.00, plus an amount equal to all distributions (whether or not
earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution
and (ii) the amount  that a holder of such  Series B  Preferred  Unit would have
received upon final  distribution  in respect of the number of Common Units into
which such Series B Preferred  Unit was  convertible  immediately  prior to such
date of  final  distribution  (but no  amount  shall be paid in  respect  of the
foregoing clause (ii) after the Fifteenth  Anniversary  Date). If, upon any such
voluntary  or  involuntary   liquidation,   dissolution  or  winding-up  of  the
Partnership,  the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof,  distributable
among the holders of the Series B  Preferred  Units are  insufficient  to pay in
full the  preferential  amount  aforesaid  on the Series B  Preferred  Units and
liquidating  payments  on  any  other  Units  or  partnership  interests  in the
Partnership of any class or series ranking,  as to payment of distributions  and
amounts upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Partnership, on a
parity with the Series B Preferred  Units,  then such  assets,  or the  proceeds
thereof,


                                      A-5
<PAGE>

shall be distributed  among the holders of Series B Preferred Units and any such
other Units or partnership  interests in the  Partnership  ratably in accordance
with the  respective  amounts  that would be payable on such  Series B Preferred
Units and such other Units or  partnership  interests in the  Partnership if all
amounts  payable  thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 6,
none of (i) a consolidation  or merger of the  Partnership  with or into another
entity,  (ii) a merger of another entity with or into the Partnership or (iii) a
sale,  lease or  conveyance  of all or  substantially  all of the  Partnership's
assets, properties or business shall be deemed to be a liquidation,  dissolution
or winding-up of the Partnership.

     (b) Written  notice of such  liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of the
Partnership,  stating  the payment  date or dates when,  and the place or places
where, the amounts  distributable in such circumstances shall be payable,  shall
be given by first class mail,  postage pre-paid,  not less than 30 nor more than
60 days prior to the payment date stated  therein,  to each record holder of the
Series B Preferred Units at the respective addresses of such holders as the same
shall appear on the transfer records of the Partnership.

     (c) After payment of the full amount of liquidating  distributions to which
they are entitled as provided in Section 6(a) of this Schedule A, the holders of
Series B Preferred  Units  shall have no right or claim to any of the  remaining
assets of the Partnership.

     7. Conversion.  Holders of Series B Preferred Units shall have the right to
convert all or a portion of such Units into Common Units, as follows:

     (a) A holder of Series B  Preferred  Units  shall have the  right,  at such
holder's option,  at any time, to convert any whole number of Series B Preferred
Units,  in whole or in part,  into Common  Units.  Each Series B Preferred  Unit
shall be convertible  into the number of Common Units determined by dividing (i)
the $50 face  amount  per  Share,  plus an  amount  equal  to all  distributions
(whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the end of the
last  Distribution  Period ending prior to the conversion,  by (ii) a conversion
price of $50.00 per Common Unit (equivalent to an initial conversion rate of one
Common  Unit for  each  Series B  Preferred  Unit),  subject  to  adjustment  as
described in Section 7(c) hereof (the "Conversion  Price");  provided,  however,
that the right to convert  Series B Preferred  Units may not be exercised  after
the Fifteenth  Anniversary  Date. No fractional Common Units will be issued upon
any conversion of Series B Preferred Units.  Instead, the number of Common Units
to be issued upon each  conversion  shall be rounded to the nearest whole number
of Common Units.

     (b) To exercise the conversion  right, the holder of each Preferred Unit to
be converted shall execute and deliver to the General Partner,  at the principal
office of the Partnership, a written notice (the "Conversion Notice") indicating
that the holder thereof elects to convert such Series B Preferred  Unit.  Unless
the Units  issuable on conversion  are to be issued in the same name as the name
in which such Series B  Preferred  Unit is  registered,  each Series B Preferred
Unit surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership,  duly executed by the holder
or such holder's duly  authorized  attorney and an amount  sufficient to pay any
transfer or similar tax (or evidence reasonably  satisfactory to the Partnership
demonstrating that such taxes have been paid).


                                      A-6
<PAGE>

     As promptly as  practicable  after  delivery  of the  Conversion  Notice as
aforesaid,  the Partnership shall amend the Partnership Agreement to reflect the
conversion and the issuance of Common Units issuable upon the conversion of such
Series B Preferred Units in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. In
addition,  the  Partnership  shall  deliver  to the  holder  at its  address  as
reflected on the records of the Partnership, a copy of such amendment.

     A holder of Series B Preferred Units at the close of business on the record
date for any  Distribution  Period shall be entitled to receive the distribution
payable  on  such  Units  on  the   corresponding   Distribution   Payment  Date
notwithstanding  the conversion of such Series B Preferred  Units following such
record date and prior to such Distribution  Payment Date and shall have no right
to  receive  any  distribution  for such  Distribution  Period in respect of the
Common Units into which such Series B Preferred Units were converted.  Except as
provided herein,  the Partnership  shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid
distributions,  whether or not in arrears, on converted Series B Preferred Units
or for distributions on the Common Units that are issued upon such conversion.

     Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected  immediately prior to
the close of business on the date on which the Conversion  Notice is received by
the  Partnership as aforesaid,  and the person or persons in whose name or names
any Common Units shall be issuable upon such conversion  shall be deemed to have
become  the holder or holders of record of such Units at such time on such date,
and such conversion  shall be at the Conversion Price in effect at such time and
on such date unless the  transfer  books of the  Partnership  shall be closed on
that date,  in which event such person or persons shall be deemed to have become
such holder or holders of record at the close of business on the next succeeding
day on which such transfer books are open, but such  conversion  shall be at the
Conversion Price in effect on the date on which such Units have been surrendered
and such notice received by the Partnership.

     (c) The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:

          (i) If the  Partnership  shall,  after the date on which the  Series B
     Preferred  Units are first  issued  (the "Issue  Date"),  (A) pay or make a
     distribution  to holders of its  partnership  interests  or Units in Common
     Units, (B) subdivide its outstanding  Common Units into a greater number of
     Units or distribute  Common Units to the holders  thereof,  (C) combine its
     outstanding  Common  Units into a smaller  number of Units or (D) issue any
     partnership interests or Units by reclassification of its Common Units, the
     Conversion  Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following
     the date fixed for the  determination  of holders  entitled to receive such
     distribution  or at the opening of business on the day next  following  the
     day on which such  subdivision,  combination  or  reclassification  becomes
     effective,  as the case may be, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any
     Series B Preferred Unit  thereafter  surrendered  for  conversion  shall be
     entitled  to  receive  the  number  of  Common  Units or other  partnership
     interests  or  securities  that such  holder  would have owned or have been
     entitled  to receive  after the  happening  of any of the events  described
     above had such Series B Preferred Unit been converted  immediately prior to
     the record date in the case of a distribution  or the effective date in the
     case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.  An adjustment made
     pursuant to this subsection (i) shall become  effective  immediately  after
     the opening of business on the day next  following  the record date (except
     as provided in subsection (g) below) in the


                                      A-7
<PAGE>

     case of a distribution  and shall become  effective  immediately  after the
     opening of business on the day next  following  the  effective  date in the
     case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.

          (ii) If the  Partnership  shall  issue  after the Issue  Date  rights,
     options or  warrants  to all  holders  of Common  Units  entitling  them to
     subscribe for or purchase Common Units (or securities  convertible  into or
     exchangeable  for  Common  Units)  at a price  per Unit  less than the Fair
     Market  Value per Common Unit on the record date for the  determination  of
     holders  of Common  Units  entitled  to  receive  such  rights,  options or
     warrants, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on
     the day next  following  such  record  date shall be  adjusted to equal the
     price  determined  by  multiplying  (I)  the  Conversion  Price  in  effect
     immediately  prior to the opening of business on the day following the date
     fixed for such  determination  by (II) a fraction,  the  numerator of which
     shall be the sum of (A) the number of Common Units outstanding at the close
     of business on the date fixed for such  determination and (B) the number of
     Common  Units  that the  aggregate  proceeds  to the  Partnership  from the
     exercise  of such  rights,  options  or  warrants  for Common  Units  would
     purchase at such Fair Market Value,  and the  denominator of which shall be
     the sum of (A) the  number  of  Common  Units  outstanding  at the close of
     business  on the date  fixed for such  determination  and (B) the number of
     additional  Common Units offered for  subscription or purchase  pursuant to
     such rights,  options or warrants.  Such adjustment  shall become effective
     immediately  after the opening of business on the day next  following  such
     record date (except as provided in subsection  (g) below).  In  determining
     whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders of Common Units
     to  subscribe  for or  purchase  Common  Units at less than the Fair Market
     Value, there shall be taken into account any consideration  received by the
     Partnership  upon  issuance and upon  exercise of such  rights,  options or
     warrants,  the  value of such  consideration,  if other  than  cash,  to be
     determined in good faith by the Board of the General Partner.

          (iii) If the  Partnership  shall  distribute  to all holders of Common
     Units any other  securities  or  evidences  of its  indebtedness  or assets
     (excluding  those rights,  options and warrants  referred to in and treated
     under subsection (ii) above, and excluding  distributions  paid exclusively
     in cash) (any of the foregoing being  hereinafter in this subsection  (iii)
     called the  "Securities"),  then in each case the Conversion Price shall be
     adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying (I) the
     Conversion  Price in effect  immediately  prior to the close of business on
     the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Units entitled to
     receive such distribution by (II) a fraction,  the numerator of which shall
     be the Fair Market Value per Common Unit on the record date mentioned below
     less the then fair market value (as  determined  in good faith by the Board
     of the General  Partner) of the portion of the  securities  so  distributed
     applicable to one Common Unit,  and the  denominator  of which shall be the
     Fair Market Value per Common Unit on the record date mentioned below.  Such
     adjustment shall become effective immediately at the opening of business on
     the  business  day next  following  (except as provided in  subsection  (g)
     below) the record  date for the  determination  of holders of Common  Units
     entitled to receive such distribution.  For the purposes of this subsection
     (iii), a distribution  in the form of a Security,  which is distributed not
     only  to the  holders  of the  Common  Units  on the  date  fixed  for  the


                                      A-8
<PAGE>

     determination  of holders of Common Units entitled to such  distribution of
     such Security, but also is distributed with each Common Unit delivered to a
     person converting a Series B Preferred Unit after such determination  date,
     shall not require an adjustment of the  Conversion  Price  pursuant to this
     subsection  (iii);  provided  that on the date,  if any,  on which a person
     converting a Series B Preferred Unit would no longer be entitled to receive
     such Security with a Common Unit, a distribution of such  Securities  shall
     be deemed to have occurred,  and the Conversion  Price shall be adjusted as
     provided in this subsection  (iii) (and such day shall be deemed to be "the
     date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Units entitled to
     receive such  distribution" and "the record date" within the meaning of the
     two preceding sentences).

          (iv) No adjustment in the  Conversion  Price shall be required  unless
     such adjustment would require a cumulative increase or decrease of at least
     1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments that by reason of
     this  subsection  (iv) are not required to be made shall be carried forward
     and taken  into  account  in any  subsequent  adjustment  until  made;  and
     provided,  further,  that  any  adjustment  shall be  required  and made in
     accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Section  7  (other  than  this
     subsection  (iv)) not later than such time as may be  required  in order to
     preserve the  tax-free  nature of a  distribution  to the holders of Common
     Units.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of  this  Section  7,  the
     Partnership  shall not be required to make any adjustment to the Conversion
     Price for the issuance of any Common Units  pursuant to any plan  providing
     for the  reinvestment of distributions or interest payable on securities of
     the Partnership and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common
     Units under such plan. All calculations  under this Section 7 shall be made
     to the nearest  cent (with $.005  being  rounded  upward) or to the nearest
     one-tenth of a Unit (with .05 of a Unit being rounded upward),  as the case
     may be.  Anything in this  subsection (c) to the contrary  notwithstanding,
     the Partnership shall be entitled,  to the extent permitted by law, to make
     such  reductions in the Conversion  Price, in addition to those required by
     this  subsection  (c),  as it  in  its  discretion  shall  determine  to be
     advisable  in order  that any Unit  distributions,  subdivision  of  Units,
     reclassification or combination of Units,  distribution of rights,  options
     or warrants to purchase Units or securities,  or a distribution  consisting
     of other  assets  (other  than cash  distributions)  hereafter  made by the
     Partnership  to its  holders  of Units  shall not be  taxable  but any such
     adjustment  shall not adversely  affect the value of the Series B Preferred
     Units.

     (d) If the  Partnership  shall  be a party to any  transaction  (including,
without  limitation,  a  merger,  consolidation,  self  tender  offer for all or
substantially  all of the Common Units,  sale of all or substantially all of the
Partnership's  assets or  recapitalization of the Common Units and excluding any
transaction  as to which  subsection  (c)(i) of this Section 7 applies) (each of
the foregoing  being referred to herein as a  "Transaction"),  in each case as a
result of which Common Units shall be converted  into the right to receive other
partnership  interests,  shares, stock,  securities or other property (including
cash or any  combination  thereof),  each Series B  Preferred  Unit which is not
converted into the right to receive other partnership interests,  shares, stock,
securities  or  other  property  in  connection  with  such  Transaction   shall
thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares, stock,  securities
and other property  (including cash or any combination  thereof) receivable upon
the  consummation of such Transaction by a holder of that number of Common Units
into which one Series B Preferred Unit was convertible immediately


                                      A-9
<PAGE>

prior to such Transaction,  assuming such holder of Common Units is not a Person
with which the Partnership  consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or
which merged into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as
the case may be (a  "Constituent  Person"),  or an  affiliate  of a  Constituent
Person. The Partnership shall not be a party to any Transaction unless the terms
of such  Transaction  are consistent with the provisions of this subsection (d),
and it shall not consent or agree to the occurrence of any Transaction until the
Partnership  has entered into an  agreement  with the  successor  or  purchasing
entity,  as the case may be,  for the  benefit  of the  holders  of the Series B
Preferred  Units that will contain  provisions  enabling the holders of Series B
Preferred Units that remain  outstanding  after such Transaction to convert into
the consideration received by holders of Common Units at the Conversion Price in
effect  immediately prior to such Transaction (with the holder having the option
to elect the type of consideration if a choice was offered in the  Transaction).
The  provisions  of this  subsection  (d) shall  similarly  apply to  successive
Transactions.

     (e) If:

          (i) the  Partnership  shall declare a distribution on the Common Units
     (other  than a cash  distribution)  or there  shall be a  reclassification,
     subdivision or combination of Common Units; or

          (ii) the  Partnership  shall  authorize the granting to the holders of
     the  Common  Units of rights,  options  or  warrants  to  subscribe  for or
     purchase any Units of any class or any other  rights,  options or warrants;
     or

          (iii) there shall be any  reclassification  of the Common Units or any
     consolidation  or merger to which the  Partnership is a party and for which
     approval of any  partners of the  Partnership  is required,  involving  the
     conversion or exchange of Common Units into  securities or other  property,
     or a self tender offer by the Partnership for all or  substantially  all of
     the Common Units,  or the sale or transfer of all or  substantially  all of
     the assets of the Partnership as an entirety; or

          (iv) there  shall  occur the  voluntary  or  involuntary  liquidation,
     dissolution or winding-up of the Partnership,

then the  Partnership  shall  cause to be mailed to the  holders of the Series B
Preferred Units at their  addresses as shown on the records of the  Partnership,
as promptly as possible a notice stating (A) the date on which a record is to be
taken for the purpose of such distribution of rights,  options or warrants,  or,
if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Units
of record to be entitled to such distribution of rights, options or warrants are
to be  determined or (B) the date on which such  reclassification,  subdivision,
combination,  consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up  is  expected  to  become  effective,  and the date as of which it is
expected  that  holders of Common  Units of record shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Units for securities or other property,  if any,  deliverable  upon
such  reclassification,  consolidation,  merger,  sale,  transfer,  liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up.  Failure to give or receive such notice or any defect
therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the  proceedings  described
in this Section 7.


                                      A-10
<PAGE>

     (f)  Whenever  the  Conversion  Price is adjusted as herein  provided,  the
Partnership  shall prepare a notice of such  adjustment of the Conversion  Price
setting  forth  the  adjusted  Conversion  Price  and the  effective  date  such
adjustment  becomes  effective and shall mail such notice of such  adjustment of
the  Conversion  Price to the  holder of each  Series B  Preferred  Unit at such
holder's last address as shown on the records of the Partnership.

     (g) In any case in which  subsection (c) of this Section 7 provides that an
adjustment shall become effective on the date next following the record date for
an event,  the  Partnership may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing
to the holder of any Series B Preferred  Unit  converted  after such record date
and before the  occurrence of such event the  additional  Common Units  issuable
upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and
above the Common Units  issuable  upon such  conversion  before giving effect to
such adjustment.

     (h) For  purposes of this Section 7, the number of Common Units at any time
outstanding  shall not include any Common Units then owned or held by or for the
account of the Partnership.  The Partnership  shall not make any distribution on
Common Units held in the treasury of the Partnership.

     (i) If any action or transaction would require adjustment of the Conversion
Price  pursuant  to more  than  one  subsection  of this  Section  7,  only  one
adjustment  shall be made, and such adjustment shall be the amount of adjustment
that has the highest absolute value.

     (j) If the  Partnership  shall take any action  affecting the Common Units,
other than action  described in this Section 7, that in the reasonable  judgment
of the General  Partner would  materially  and adversely  affect the  conversion
rights of the holders of the Series B Preferred  Units, the Conversion Price for
the Series B Preferred Units may be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in
such manner,  if any, and at such time, as the General Partner  determines to be
equitable in the circumstances.

     (k) The  Partnership  covenants that Common Units issued upon conversion of
the  Series  B  Preferred  Units  shall  be  validly  issued,   fully  paid  and
nonassessable  and the holder thereof shall be entitled to rights of a holder of
Common Units  specified in the Partnership  Agreement.  Prior to the delivery of
any  securities  that  the  Partnership  shall  be  obligated  to  deliver  upon
conversion of the Series B Preferred  Units,  the Partnership  shall endeavor to
comply with all federal and state laws and regulations  thereunder requiring the
registration  of such  securities  with,  or any  approval  of or consent to the
delivery thereof, by any governmental authority.

     (l) The Partnership will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue
or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of Common Units or
other  securities  or property  on  conversion  of the Series B Preferred  Units
pursuant hereto;  provided,  however,  that the Company shall not be required to
pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue
or delivery of Common Units or other securities or property in a name other than
that of the holder of the Series B Preferred Units to be converted,  and no such
issue or  delivery  shall be made  unless and until the person  requesting  such
issue or  delivery  has paid to the  Partnership  the  amount of any such tax or
established,  to the reasonable  satisfaction of the Partnership,  that such tax
has been paid.

for or purchase  Shares  (other than Rights  referred to in Section 6(b)) or any
other securities or property (other than  distributions  paid in cash), then the
Share  Purchase  Price also shall  include  such  rights,  options,  warrants or
convertible or  exchangeable  securities or other  securities or property that a
holder of that  number of Shares  would have been  entitled  to receive had such
holder held such Shares  immediately  prior to the time holders of Shares became
entitled thereto.

     "Shares" shall mean shares of the Preferred Stock.

     2. Grant of Redemption Rights.

     (a) Upon the terms and  subject to the  conditions  contained  herein,  the
Partnership does hereby grant to each Contributing  Party, and such Contributing
Party does hereby accept,  the right, but without obligation on the part of such
Contributing  Party, to require the Partnership to redeem from time to time part
or all of the Series B Preferred Units of such Contributing Party


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

for the Cash  Purchase  Price with  respect  to such  Series B  Preferred  Units
("Redemption Rights").

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 2(a),  the General  Partner
may, in its sole and absolute  discretion,  assume and satisfy the obligation of
the  Partnership  with  respect  to  any  Contributing  Party's  exercise  of  a
Redemption Right by paying to such Contributing  Party, at the General Partner's
election  (which may be exercised  in the General  Partner's  sole  discretion),
either the Cash  Purchase  Price or the Share  Purchase  Price (or a combination
thereof)  with  respect  to  the  Series  B  Preferred   Units  for  which  such
Contributing  Party  exercised its  Redemption  Rights.  If the General  Partner
assumes such obligations with respect to the exercise by any Contributing  Party
of a  Redemption  Right as to  certain  Series B  Preferred  Units and makes the
required  payment of the Share  Purchase  Price,  the Cash Purchase Price or any
combination  thereof,  then the Partnership  shall have no obligation to pay any
amount to such  Contributing  Party with respect to the exercise of a Redemption
Right for such  Series B  Preferred  Units,  and any  Series B  Preferred  Units
purchased shall be owned by the General Partner for all purposes.

     (c) If the General  Partner shall assume and satisfy the obligations of the
Partnership  with  respect  to  the  exercise  of  a  Redemption  Right  by  any
Contributing  Party, the Partnership,  such  Contributing  Party and the General
Partner each shall treat the  transaction  between the General  Partner and such
Contributing  Party as a sale of such  Contributing  Party's  Series B Preferred
Units (or a portion  thereof)  to the General  Partner  for  federal  income tax
purposes.

     (d) Upon the  redemption  or  purchase  of part or all of any  Contributing
Party's  Series B  Preferred  Units and the payment of the  Purchase  Price with
respect  thereto,  such  Person  shall be deemed  withdrawn  as a Partner in the
Partnership to the extent of the Series B Preferred  Units redeemed or purchased
and shall have no  further  rights or  obligations  under  this  Agreement  with
respect to such  redeemed  or  purchased  Series B  Preferred  Units;  provided,
however,  that such Contributing Party's rights under this Agreement with regard
to any other Series B Preferred Units will continue in full force and effect.

     (e) No fractional Shares shall be issued  hereunder.  In lieu of fractional
Shares,  the General  Partner shall pay cash based on the per Share  liquidation
preference on the relevant closing date.

     (f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the General
Partner shall not issue the Share Purchase Price upon exercise of any Redemption
Right by a  Contributing  Partner with  respect to any Series B Preferred  Units
unless all of the Shares so issued are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
the Registration  Statement (as herein defined) covering such Shares shall be in
effect  and  available  for use to effect a public  distribution  by the  holder
thereof of such Shares  immediately  upon such issuance and the General  Partner
only shall issue such Share  Purchase  Price to the extent that the  issuance of
such  Shares to such  Contributing  Party does not violate  the  Certificate  of
Incorporation  (assuming such Contributing Party owns no shares of capital stock
of the General  Partner other than those issued  pursuant hereto and pursuant to
the Common Units Redemption Rights Agreement).


                                      -4-

     3. Exercise of Redemption Rights.

     3.1 Time for Exercise of Redemption  Rights.  Each  Contributing  Party may
exercise its Redemption Rights in whole or in part and at any time and from time
to time on or after the date hereof but prior to the Expiration Date;  provided,
however,  that the Redemption Rights may not be exercised at any one time by any
Contributing  Party with respect to less than 2,000 Series B Preferred Units (or
all the Series B Preferred Units then owned by such  Contributing  Party if such
Contributing  Party owns less than  2,000  Series B  Preferred  Units) or in the
event that such  exercise of  Redemption  Rights (or the  assignment of Series B
Preferred  Units or  delivery  of either  the Cash  Purchase  Price or the Share
Purchase  Price with  respect  thereto)  violates  the terms of the  Partnership
Agreement,  the  Certificate of  Incorporation  or applicable law. Once given, a
Notice shall be irrevocable subject to the payment of the Purchase Price for the
Series B Preferred Units specified therein in accordance with the terms hereof.

     3.2 Method of Exercise;  Etc. The  Redemption  Rights shall be exercised by
delivery to the  Partnership of (a) written notice (the "Notice") in the form of
Exhibit A specifying  the number of the Series B Preferred  Units to be redeemed
and the name or names  (with  address)  in which any Shares  issuable  upon such
exercise  shall be registered if different than the  Contributing  Party and (b)
the  certificates,   if  any,   representing  such  Series  B  Preferred  Units.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that (A)
all of the Series B Preferred  Units of any deceased  Contributing  Party or the
Series B  Preferred  Units of any  partnership,  limited  liability  company  or
pass-through  entity that are allocable to a deceased  partner,  member or other
Person  have not been  converted  into  Common  Units on or prior to the date of
death of such  Contributing  Party or other Person,  and (B) the exercise of the
Redemption Rights with respect to said Series B Preferred Units shall not result
in the  recognition  of gain for federal  income tax purposes by any party,  the
Partnership  shall  have  the  right  to  require  the  Contributing   Party  or
partnership, limited liability company or other pass-through entity or its legal
representative,  to exercise  the  Redemption  Rights as to all of such Series B
Preferred  Units and to take any and all  necessary  action  hereunder to effect
such exercise.

     3.3 Closing. The closing of the redemption or purchase and sale pursuant to
an  exercise  of the  Redemption  Rights by any  Contributing  Party shall occur
within 30 days following the giving of the Notice;  provided,  however,  that no
closing may occur  hereunder  prior to the earlier of the one hundred  twentieth
day after the date  hereof  and the date of  effectiveness  of the  Registration
Statement.  Such  Contributing  Party shall execute such other  documents as the
General  Partner may reasonably  require in connection  with the closing of such
redemption or purchase and sale.

     3.4 Payment of Cash or Issuance of Shares. At the closing of the redemption
or  purchase  and sale of Series B  Preferred  Units  pursuant to an exercise of
Redemption Rights by a Contributing Party, the Partnership shall deliver to such
Contributing  Party the Cash  Purchase  Price by check or, in the event that the
General Partner has assumed the  obligations of the Partnership  with respect to
such exercise of Redemption  Rights,  the General  Partner shall deliver to such
Contributing  Party,  at the  election  of the  General  Partner  (which  may be
exercised in the General Partner's sole discretion) either (a) the Cash Purchase
Price  by  check or (b)  certificates  representing  the  Shares  and any  other
securities and/or other property constituting the Share Purchase Price, together
with cash in lieu of the issuance of any fraction of a Share as provided


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

in Section 2(e), or a combination  thereof.  In addition,  in the event that the
General Partner has assumed the  obligations of the Partnership  with respect to
such exercise of Redemption  Rights and delivers the Share Purchase  Price,  the
General  Partner  also shall pay to such  Contributing  Partner  the accrued and
unpaid  distributions  in  respect  of the  Series B  Preferred  Units  that are
acquired by the General Partner.

     4. Matters Relating to Shares.

     4.1 Registration.

     (a) As soon as practicable  following the date hereof,  the General Partner
shall  file  a  Registration   Statement  on  Form  S-3  or  other   appropriate
registration  form (the  "Registration  Statement")  with the SEC  covering  the
resale by  Contributing  Parties of the Shares and/or the shares of common stock
of the General Partner to be issued upon their  conversion  (referred to in this
Section 4.1 as the "Shares") to be issued upon exercise of the Redemption Rights
as to all  Series B  Preferred  Units and full  satisfaction  of the  Redemption
Rights by delivery of Shares and shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause
the   Registration   Statement  to  become  effective  as  soon  as  practicable
thereafter. Following the effective date of the Registration Statement and until
the Shares covered by the Registration  Statement have been sold or are eligible
for resale under Rule 144(k)  promulgated  under the Securities Act, the General
Partner shall keep the Registration  Statement current,  effective and available
for the resale by Contributing  Parties of the Shares delivered to them pursuant
hereto.  The General  Partner  shall bear all  expenses  relating to filing such
Registration   Statement  and  keeping  such  Registration   Statement  current,
effective and available;  provided,  however, that the General Partner shall not
be  responsible  for any  brokerage  fees or  underwriting  commissions  due and
payable by any Contributing Party.

     (b) During the time period when the  Registration  Statement is required to
be current,  effective and available under Section  4.1(a),  the General Partner
also shall:

          (i) prepare and file with the SEC such  amendments and  supplements to
     the Registration Statement and the prospectus  constituting a part thereof,
     as amended or supplemented (the "Prospectus"),  as may be necessary to keep
     such Registration  Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of
     the  Securities  Act with respect to the sale of the Shares covered by such
     Registration Statement whenever any Contributing Party shall desire to sell
     or otherwise dispose of the same but in no event beyond the period in which
     the Registration Statement is required to be kept in effect;

          (ii) furnish to each Contributing  Party,  without charge, such number
     of authorized  copies of the Prospectus,  and any amendments or supplements
     to the Prospectus,  in conformity  with the  requirements of the Securities
     Act, and such other  documents  as any  Contributing  Party may  reasonably
     request in order to facilitate the public sale or other  disposition of the
     Shares owned by Contributing Parties.

          (iii) register or qualify the securities  covered by the  Registration
     Statement under state securities or blue sky laws of such  jurisdictions as
     are  reasonably  required to effect a sale thereof and do any and all other
     acts and things which may be necessary or


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

     appropriate  under  such  state  securities  or blue  sky  laws  to  enable
     Contributing  Parties to consummate the public sale or other disposition in
     such jurisdictions of such securities;

          (iv) before filing any amendments or  supplements to the  Registration
     Statement or the Prospectus,  furnish copies of all such documents proposed
     to be filed to the Contributing Party  Representative who shall be afforded
     a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; provided,  however,
     that  all  such  documents   shall  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
     Contributing  Party  Representative  insofar as they relate to  information
     concerning  Contributing  Parties  (including,   without  limitation,   the
     proposed method of distribution of any Contributing Party's securities);

          (v)  notify   Contributing   Parties   promptly   (A)  when  any  such
     Registration  Statement has become  effective  and when any  post-effective
     amendments and supplements thereto become effective,  (B) of any request by
     the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and supplements to
     such   Registration   Statement  and  the   Prospectus  or  for  additional
     information,  (C)  of the  issuance  by the  SEC  or any  state  securities
     authority  of any  stop  order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of any such
     Registration  Statement  or the  initiation  of  any  proceedings  for  the
     purpose,  (D) if,  between  the  effective  date of any  such  Registration
     Statement  and the sale of the  Shares  to which it  relates,  the  General
     Partner  receives any  notification  with respect to the  suspension of the
     qualification  of the  Shares  or  initiation  of any  proceeding  for such
     purpose,  and (E) of the  happening  of any event  during the  period  such
     Registration  Statement is  effective  which in the judgment of the General
     Partner  makes any  statement  made in the  Registration  Statement  or the
     Prospectus  untrue in any material  respect or which requires the making of
     any changes in the  Registration  Statement or the  Prospectus  in order to
     make the statements therein not misleading;

          (vi) use its  reasonable  best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
     order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement at the
     earliest practicable time;

          (vii) cooperate with each Contributing  Party to facilitate the timely
     preparation  and delivery of certificates  representing  Shares being sold,
     which  certificates  shall not bear any  restrictive  legends  provided the
     Shares  evidenced  thereby  have  been  sold in a manner  permitted  by the
     Prospectus; and

          (viii)  upon the  occurrence  of any  event  contemplated  by  Section
     4.1(b)(v)(E)   hereof,   promptly   prepare  and  file  a   supplement   or
     post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or
     any document  incorporated  therein by reference or file any other required
     document so that, as thereafter  delivered to the purchasers of the Shares,
     the Prospectus will not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or
     omit to state a material fact necessary to make the  statements  therein in
     light of the  circumstances  under  which they were made,  not  misleading;
     provided,  however,  that  the  obligation  to  prepare  and  file any such
     supplement or  post-effective  amendment  shall be suspended if the General
     Partner, relying upon advice of counsel,  determines that disclosure of any
     information  required  to be  included  therein  would  be  adverse  to its
     interests, but such suspension shall not extend beyond 90 days with respect
     to any such specified event.


                                      -7-

     (c) The General  Partner  hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Contributing Party and each person, if any, who controls such Contributing Party
(within the meaning of either  Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act) from and against any and all losses,  claims,  damages,  costs
and expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees) ("Claims") to which such
Contributing  Party or such  controlling  person may become  subject,  under the
Securities  Act or otherwise,  caused by any untrue  statement or alleged untrue
statement  of a material  fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement or the
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement  thereto, or caused by any omission or
alleged  omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,  and shall reimburse
such Contributing  Party and each such controlling person for any legal or other
expenses  reasonably  incurred by such  Contributing  Party in  connection  with
investigating  or  defending  any  such  loss as  such  expenses  are  incurred;
provided,  however,  that the General Partner shall not be liable insofar as any
such  losses,   claims,   damages,  costs  and  expenses  (including  reasonable
attorneys'  fees) are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission based upon information  furnished in writing to the
General  Partner by any  Contributing  Party  expressly  for use  therein.  Each
Contributing Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the General Partner and
each person,  if any, who  controls the General  Partner  (within the meaning of
either  Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) from
and against any and all Claims to which the General Partner or such  controlling
person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise,  caused by any
untrue  statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon
such   information   furnished  in  writing  to  the  General  Partner  by  such
Contributing Party.

     (d) Each  Contributing  Party agrees that,  upon receipt of any notice from
the  General  Partner of the  happening  of any event of the kind  described  in
Section  4.1(b)(v)(E),   such  Contributing  Party  will  forthwith  discontinue
disposition  of securities  pursuant to the  Registration  Statement  until such
Contributing  Party's  receipt  of the  copies of the  supplemented  or  amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 4.1(b)(viii).

     (e) Upon the written  request to the General  Partner  from time to time as
below  provided  and  subject to other  contractual  obligations  of the General
Partner,  the  Contributing  Parties holding Shares covered by the  Registration
Statement who desire to do so may sell such Shares  covered by the  Registration
Statement  in an  underwritten  offering.  In such  underwritten  offering,  the
investment  banker or bankers and manager or managers that will  administer  the
offering  will be selected by, and the  underwriting  arrangements  with respect
thereto  will be  approved  by, the  Contributing  Parties;  provided  that such
investment bankers and managers and underwriting arrangements must be reasonably
satisfactory to the General  Partner.  No Contributing  Party may participate in
any underwritten  offering  contemplated  hereby unless such Contributing  Party
agrees to sell such  Contributing  Party's  Shares  covered by the  Registration
Statement  in  accordance  with  any  approved  underwriting   arrangements  and
completes  and  executes  all  reasonable  questionnaires,  powers of  attorney,
indemnities,  underwriting  agreements,  lock-up  letters  and  other  documents
required under the terms of such approved underwriting arrangements. The General
Partner shall be responsible for the costs of preparing and filing the amendment
or supplement that is referred to below, and the selling  securityholders  shall
pay their attorney's fees and underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in
connection with such underwritten offerings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
receipt of a request from the managing  underwriter or a  representative  of the
Contributing Parties to prepare


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

and file an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and Prospectus
in connection with such underwritten offering, the General Partner may delay the
filing of any such  amendment  or  supplement  or  postpone  taking  action with
respect to an  underwritten  offering for a period not to exceed an aggregate of
180 days in any calendar  year,  if the General  Partner  determines in its good
faith  judgment that the filing of such amendment or supplement or the taking of
such  action  with  respect to an  underwritten  offering  would have a material
adverse effect on the business,  operations or prospects of the General Partner,
or adversely affect a material financing, acquisition,  disposition of assets or
stock, merger or other comparable transaction.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary contained in the foregoing, the Contributing Parties shall not have the
right to effect more than two underwritten  offerings pursuant to this paragraph
and each such offering shall be required to include minimum gross sales proceeds
of $17,500,000.

     (f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the General
Partner  shall  have no  obligation  to keep any  registration  statement  filed
pursuant  to this  Section 4.1  effective  after the  Expiration  Date or if the
status of the General  Partner (or its  successor)  as an Exchange Act Reporting
Company is terminated.

     4.2  Reservation of Shares.  At all times while the  Redemption  Rights are
outstanding,  the General  Partner  shall  reserve for  issuance  such number of
Shares as may be necessary to enable the General Partner to issue Shares in full
satisfaction  of all Redemption  Rights which are from time to time  outstanding
(assuming that there are no limitations as to the ownership of such Shares under
the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  which  relate to  compliance  with the REIT
Requirements  and that the  General  Partner  elected to pay the Share  Purchase
Price with respect to all such Redemption Rights).

     4.3 Fully  Paid and  Non-Assessable.  All Shares  which may be issued  upon
exercise of the  Redemption  Rights  shall be duly and validly  issued and fully
paid and non-assessable.

     5. Transfer and Similar  Taxes.  The General  Partner shall pay any and all
documentary  stamp or similar issue or transfer  taxes payable in respect of the
issue or  delivery  of shares of Common  Stock or other  securities  or property
pursuant  hereto;  provided,  however,  that the  General  Partner  shall not be
required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer  involved
in the  issue or  delivery  of shares of  Common  Stock or other  securities  or
property  in a name  other  than that of the  holder of the  Common  Units to be
exchanged,  and no such  issue or  delivery  shall be made  unless and until the
person  requesting  such issue or delivery  has paid to the General  Partner the
amount of any such tax or  established,  to the reasonable  satisfaction  of the
General Partner, that such tax has been paid.

     6. Anti-Dilution and Adjustment Provisions.

     (a) The  Conversion  Factor shall be adjusted in the event that the General
Partner  (i)  declares  or pays a dividend or  distribution  on its  outstanding
Shares in Shares  or makes a  distribution  to all  holders  of its  outstanding
Shares in Shares,  (ii) subdivides its outstanding Shares, or (iii) combines its
outstanding  Shares  into a  smaller  number  of  Shares.  In  such  event,  the
Conversion  Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying  the Conversion  Factor by a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  shall be the  number of Shares  issued  and
outstanding on the record date for


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

such  dividend,  distribution,  subdivision  or  combination  (assuming for such
purposes  that such  dividend,  distribution,  subdivision  or  combination  has
occurred  as of such  time) and the  denominator  of which  shall be the  actual
number  of  Shares   (determined   without  the  above  assumption)  issued  and
outstanding on the record date for such dividend,  distribution,  subdivision or
combination.  Any  adjustment to the  Conversion  Factor shall become  effective
immediately  after the effective  date of such event  retroactive  to the record
date, if any, for such event.

     (b) If at any time the  holders  of  Shares  are  entitled  to any right (a
"Right") to subscribe pro rata for additional securities of the General Partner,
whether Preferred Stock or other classifications, or for any other securities or
interests  that a  Contributing  Party would have been entitled to subscribe for
if,  immediately prior to such grant, such Contributing  Party had exercised its
Redemption  Rights and received the Share Purchase Price in payment thereof,  in
lieu of any  adjustment  under any other  subsection  of this Section 6 or other
provision of this  Agreement and except to the extent that  provision  otherwise
has  been  made  for  such  Contributing  Party  to  receive  such  Right,  such
Contributing  Party also shall  receive  from the General  Partner,  prior to or
concurrent  with the time such Right  becomes  exercisable,  the same Right that
such Contributing  Party would have been entitled to if such Contributing  Party
had  exercised  its  Redemption  Rights in full and received the Share  Purchase
Price in satisfaction  thereof  immediately  prior to the time holders of Shares
became entitled to such Right.

     (c) Upon the occurrence of a Major  Transaction  Event, the General Partner
shall  cause  effective  provision  to be made so  that,  upon  exercise  of the
Redemption  Rights by any  Contributing  Party and the  election  of the General
Partner to pay the Purchase Price at any time  following such Major  Transaction
Event by means of the Share Purchase Price, such  Contributing  Party shall have
the right to  acquire,  in lieu of the Shares  which  otherwise  would have been
issued to such  Contributing  Party,  the kind and amount of shares of stock and
other securities and property (and the provisions contained in Section 4.1 shall
apply anew to the extent that such  securities  are of a class of  securities of
the General Partner or its successor that are registered under the Exchange Act)
and  interests  as would be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for
the number of Shares constituting the Share Purchase Price as if such Redemption
Rights had been  exercised and the General  Partner had satisfied the Redemption
Rights by delivery of the Share  Purchase  Price  immediately  before such Major
Transaction Event.

     (d) The Partnership  shall give written notice to  Contributing  Parties of
any Major  Transaction  Event promptly after such Major Transaction is announced
to the public.

     (e) The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply to successive  events that
may occur from time to time but only  shall  apply to a  particular  event if it
occurs prior to the exercise in full of the Redemption Rights or the liquidation
of the  Partnership.  Nothing  contained herein shall prevent or otherwise limit
the liquidation of the Partnership  pursuant to the  Partnership  Agreement,  as
amended from time to time.

     (f)  Whenever the  Conversion  Factor is adjusted as herein  provided,  the
General Partner shall compute the adjusted  Conversion Factor in accordance with
this Section 6 and shall  prepare a  certificate  signed by the chief  financial
officer of the General Partner setting forth the adjusted


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Conversion  Factor and  showing in  reasonable  detail the facts upon which such
adjustment  is  based,  and such  certificate  shall  forthwith  be filed at the
offices of the General Partner.

     7. Miscellaneous Provisions.

     7.1 Notices.  All notices or other  communications  given  pursuant to this
Agreement,  including without limitation any Notice,  shall be sent to the party

or,  if  mailed  as  described  above,  after 5  Business  Days  or,  if sent by
facsimile, upon receipt of confirmed answerback and (b) may be given either by a
party or by such  party's  attorneys.  For  purposes of this  Section  7.1,  the

Marshall E. Eisenberg,  facsimile  number (312)  269-1747),  and, in the case of
each  Contributing  Party, as set forth on the records of the  Partnership.  The
address of any party may be changed by a notice in writing  given in  accordance
with the provisions hereof.

     7.2 Assignment.  The rights of any Contributing Party hereunder  (including
the Redemption Rights) shall automatically devolve upon any Person to the extent
that such Person  holds  Series B  Preferred  Units,  and becomes a  substituted
partner with respect to such Series B Preferred  Units,  in accordance  with the
Partnership  Agreement and delivers to the Partnership a written instrument,  in
form reasonably  satisfactory to the Partnership,  pursuant to which such Person
agrees  to be bound by the terms  hereof  (but the  rights of such  Contributing
Party  hereunder are not  otherwise  assignable).  Subject to the  provisions of
Section 6, the General Partner may assign this Agreement  without the consent of
any  Contributing  Party,  provided  that no such  assignment  shall relieve the

such Person  shall be deemed  withdrawn as a Partner in the  Partnership  to the
extent of the  Common  Units  redeemed  or  purchased  and shall have no further
rights or  obligations  under this  Agreement  with respect to such  redeemed or
purchased Common Units; provided, however, that such Contributing Party's rights
under this Agreement with regard to any other Common Units will continue in full
force and effect.

     (e) No fractional Shares shall be issued  hereunder.  In lieu of fractional
Shares, the General Partner shall pay cash based on the Current Per Share Market
Price on the relevant Computation Date.

     (f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the General
Partner shall not issue the Share Purchase Price upon exercise of any Redemption
Right with  respect to any Common  Units  unless all of the Shares so issued are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Registration  Statement (as herein
defined) covering such Shares shall be in effect and available for use to effect
a public distribution by the holder thereof of such Shares immediately upon such
issuance and the General  Partner only may issue the Share Purchase Price to the
extent  that the  issuance of such  Shares to such  Contributing  Party does not
violate the Certificate of Incorporation  (assuming such Contributing Party owns
no shares of capital  stock of the  General  Partner  other  than  those  issued
pursuant hereto and pursuant to the Common Units Redemption Rights Agreement).

     3. Exercise of Redemption Rights.

     3.1 Time for Exercise of Redemption  Rights.  Each  Contributing  Party may
exercise its Redemption Rights in whole or in part and at any time and from time
to time on or after the date hereof but prior to the Expiration Date;  provided,
however,  that the Redemption Rights may not be exercised at any one time by any
Contributing  Party with  respect to less than  1,000  Common  Units (or all the
Common Units then owned by such Contributing  Party if such  Contributing  Party
owns less  than  1,000  Common  Units) or in the  event  that such  exercise  of
Redemption  Rights (or the  assignment of Common Units or delivery of either the
Cash Purchase Price or the Share Purchase Price with respect  thereto)  violates
the terms of the  Partnership  Agreement,  the Certificate of  Incorporation  or
applicable law. Once given, a Notice shall be irrevocable subject to the payment
of the Purchase Price for the Common Units specified  therein in accordance with
the terms hereof.

     3.2  Method of  Exercise.  The  Redemption  Rights  shall be  exercised  by
delivery to the  Partnership of (a) written notice (the "Notice") in the form of
Exhibit A specifying  the number of the Common Units to be redeemed and the name
or names (with address) in which any Shares issuable upon such exercise shall be
registered if different than the Contributing Party and (b) the certificates, if
any,  representing such Common Units.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained  herein,  in the event that the exercise of the Redemption Rights with
respect to all of the Common  Units of any  deceased  Contributing  Party or the
Common  Units of any  partnership,  limited  liability  company or  pass-through
entity that are  allocable to a deceased  partner,  member or other Person shall
not result in the  recognition  of gain for federal  income tax  purposes by any
party, the Partnership shall have the right to require the Contributing Party or
partnership, limited


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

liability company or other  pass-through  entity or its legal  representative to
exercise  the  Redemption  Rights as to all of such Common Units and to take any
and all necessary action hereunder to effect such exercise.

     3.3 Closing. The closing of the redemption or purchase and sale pursuant to
an  exercise  of the  Redemption  Rights by any  Contributing  Party shall occur
within 30 days following the giving of the Notice;  provided,  however,  that no
closing may occur  hereunder  prior to the earlier of the one hundred  twentieth
day after the date  hereof  and the date of  effectiveness  of the  Registration
Statement.  Such  Contributing  Party shall execute such other  documents as the
General  Partner may reasonably  require in connection  with the closing of such
redemption or purchase and sale.

     3.4 Payment of Cash or Issuance of Shares. At the closing of the redemption
or purchase  and sale of Common  Units  pursuant  to an  exercise of  Redemption
Rights  by  a  Contributing   Party,  the  Partnership  shall  deliver  to  such
Contributing  Party the Cash  Purchase  Price by check or, in the event that the
General Partner has assumed the  obligations of the Partnership  with respect to
such exercise of Redemption  Rights,  the General  Partner shall deliver to such
Contributing  Party,  at the  election  of the  General  Partner  (which  may be
exercised in the General Partner's sole discretion) either (a) the Cash Purchase
Price  by  check or (b)  certificates  representing  the  Shares  and any  other
securities and/or other property constituting the Share Purchase Price, together
with cash in lieu of the  issuance  of any  fraction  of a Share as  provided in
Section 2(e), or a combination thereof.

     4. Matters Relating to Shares.

     4.1 Registration.

     (a) As soon as practicable  following the date hereof,  the General Partner
shall  file  a  Registration   Statement  on  Form  S-3  or  other   appropriate
registration  form (the  "Registration  Statement")  with the SEC  covering  the
resale by  Contributing  Parties of the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the
Redemption  Rights assuming full conversion of the Series B Preferred Units into
Common  Units and full  satisfaction  of the  Redemption  Rights by  delivery of
Shares  and shall use its  reasonable  best  efforts  to cause the  Registration
Statement to become effective as soon as practicable  thereafter.  Following the
effective date of the Registration Statement and until the Shares covered by the
Registration  Statement  have been sold or are  eligible  for resale  under Rule
144(k)  promulgated under the Securities Act, the General Partner shall keep the
Registration  Statement  current,  effective  and  available  for the  resale by
Contributing  Parties of the  Shares  delivered  to them  pursuant  hereto.  The
General  Partner  shall bear all expenses  relating to filing such  Registration
Statement  and  keeping  such  Registration  Statement  current,  effective  and
available;  provided, however, that the General Partner shall not be responsible
for any  brokerage  fees or  underwriting  commissions  due and  payable  by any
Contributing Party.

     (b) During the time period when the  Registration  Statement is required to
be current,  effective and available under Section  4.1(a),  the General Partner
also shall:

          (i) prepare and file with the SEC such  amendments and  supplements to
     the Registration Statement and the prospectus  constituting a part thereof,
     as amended or


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

     supplemented  (the  "Prospectus"),   as  may  be  necessary  to  keep  such
     Registration  Statement  effective and to comply with the provisions of the
     Securities  Act with  respect  to the sale of the  Shares  covered  by such
     Registration Statement whenever any Contributing Party shall desire to sell
     or otherwise dispose of the same but in no event beyond the period in which
     the Registration Statement is required to be kept in effect;

          (ii) furnish to each Contributing  Party,  without charge, such number
     of authorized  copies of the Prospectus,  and any amendments or supplements
     to the Prospectus,  in conformity  with the  requirements of the Securities
     Act, and such other  documents  as any  Contributing  Party may  reasonably
     request in order to facilitate the public sale or other  disposition of the
     Shares owned by Contributing Parties.

          (iii) register or qualify the securities  covered by the  Registration
     Statement under state securities or blue sky laws of such  jurisdictions as
     are  reasonably  required to effect a sale thereof and do any and all other
     acts and things  which may be  necessary  or  appropriate  under such state
     securities  or blue sky laws to enable  Contributing  Parties to consummate
     the  public  sale  or  other  disposition  in  such  jurisdictions  of such
     securities;

          (iv) before filing any amendments or  supplements to the  Registration
     Statement or the Prospectus,  furnish copies of all such documents proposed
     to be filed to the Contributing Party  Representative who shall be afforded
     a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; provided,  however,
     that  all  such  documents   shall  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
     Contributing  Party  Representative  insofar as they relate to  information
     concerning  Contributing  Parties  (including,   without  limitation,   the
     proposed method of distribution of any Contributing Party's securities);

          (v)  notify   Contributing   Parties   promptly   (A)  when  any  such
     Registration  Statement has become  effective  and when any  post-effective
     amendments and supplements thereto become effective,  (B) of any request by
     the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and supplements to
     such   Registration   Statement  and  the   Prospectus  or  for  additional
     information,  (C)  of the  issuance  by the  SEC  or any  state  securities
     authority  of any  stop  order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of any such
     Registration  Statement  or the  initiation  of  any  proceedings  for  the
     purpose,  (D) if,  between  the  effective  date of any  such  Registration
     Statement  and the sale of the  Shares  to which it  relates,  the  General
     Partner  receives any  notification  with respect to the  suspension of the
     qualification  of the  Shares  or  initiation  of any  proceeding  for such
     purpose,  and (E) of the  happening  of any event  during the  period  such
     Registration  Statement is  effective  which in the judgment of the General
     Partner  makes any  statement  made in the  Registration  Statement  or the
     Prospectus  untrue in any material  respect or which requires the making of
     any changes in the  Registration  Statement or the  Prospectus  in order to
     make the statements therein not misleading;

          (vi) use its  reasonable  best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
     order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement at the
     earliest practicable time;

          (vii) cooperate with each Contributing  Party to facilitate the timely
     preparation  and delivery of certificates  representing  Shares being sold,
     which certificates shall not


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

     bear any restrictive  legends  provided the Shares  evidenced  thereby have
     been sold in a manner permitted by the Prospectus; and

          (viii)  upon the  occurrence  of any  event  contemplated  by  Section
     4.1(b)(v)(E)   hereof,   promptly   prepare  and  file  a   supplement   or
     post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or
     any document  incorporated  therein by reference or file any other required
     document so that, as thereafter  delivered to the purchasers of the Shares,
     the Prospectus will not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or
     omit to state a material fact necessary to make the  statements  therein in
     light of the  circumstances  under  which they were made,  not  misleading;
     provided,  however,  that  the  obligation  to  prepare  and  file any such
     supplement or  post-effective  amendment  shall be suspended if the General
     Partner, relying upon advice of counsel,  determines that disclosure of any
     information  required  to be  included  therein  would  be  adverse  to its
     interests, but such suspension shall not extend beyond 90 days with respect
     to any such specified event.

     (c) The General  Partner  hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Contributing Party and each person, if any, who controls such Contributing Party
(within the meaning of either  Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act) from and against any and all losses,  claims,  damages,  costs
and expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees) ("Claims") to which such
Contributing  Party or such  controlling  person may become  subject,  under the
Securities  Act or otherwise,  caused by any untrue  statement or alleged untrue
statement  of a material  fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement or the
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement  thereto, or caused by any omission or
alleged  omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,  and shall reimburse
such Contributing  Party and each such controlling person for any legal or other
expenses  reasonably  incurred by such  Contributing  Party in  connection  with
investigating  or  defending  any  such  loss as  such  expenses  are  incurred;
provided,  however,  that the General Partner shall not be liable insofar as any
such  losses,   claims,   damages,  costs  and  expenses  (including  reasonable
attorneys'  fees) are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission based upon information  furnished in writing to the
General  Partner by any  Contributing  Party  expressly  for use  therein.  Each
Contributing Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the General Partner and
each person,  if any, who  controls the General  Partner  (within the meaning of
either  Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) from
and against any and all Claims to which the General Partner or such  controlling
person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise,  caused by any
untrue  statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon
such   information   furnished  in  writing  to  the  General  Partner  by  such
Contributing Party.

     (d) Each  Contributing  Party agrees that,  upon receipt of any notice from
the  General  Partner of the  happening  of any event of the kind  described  in
Section  4.1(b)(v)(E),   such  Contributing  Party  will  forthwith  discontinue
disposition  of securities  pursuant to the  Registration  Statement  until such
Contributing  Party's  receipt  of the  copies of the  supplemented  or  amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 4.1(b)(viii).

     (e) Upon the written  request to the General  Partner  from time to time as
below  provided  and  subject to other  contractual  obligations  of the General
Partner, the Contributing


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Parties holding Shares covered by the Registration Statement who desire to do so
may sell such Shares covered by the  Registration  Statement in an  underwritten
offering.  In such underwritten  offering,  the investment banker or bankers and
manager or managers that will  administer  the offering will be selected by, and
the  underwriting  arrangements  with  respect  thereto will be approved by, the
Contributing  Parties;  provided that such  investment  bankers and managers and
underwriting  arrangements  must  be  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  General
Partner.  No  Contributing  Party may participate in any  underwritten  offering
contemplated   hereby  unless  such  Contributing  Party  agrees  to  sell  such
Contributing Party's Shares covered by the Registration  Statement in accordance
with any  approved  underwriting  arrangements  and  completes  and executes all
reasonable  questionnaires,   powers  of  attorney,  indemnities,   underwriting
agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such
approved underwriting arrangements. The General Partner shall be responsible for
the costs of preparing and filing the  amendment or supplement  that is referred
to below,  and the selling  securityholders  shall pay their attorney's fees and
underwriting   discounts  and  commissions  incurred  in  connection  with  such
underwritten offerings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon receipt of a request
from the managing underwriter or a representative of the Contributing Parties to
prepare and file an amendment or  supplement to the  Registration  Statement and
Prospectus in connection with such  underwritten  offering,  the General Partner
may delay the filing of any such  amendment  or  supplement  or postpone  taking
action with  respect to an  underwritten  offering for a period not to exceed an
aggregate of 180 days in any calendar year, if the General Partner determines in
its good faith  judgment that the filing of such  amendment or supplement or the
taking of such  action with  respect to an  underwritten  offering  would have a
material adverse effect on the business,  operations or prospects of the General
Partner, or adversely affect a material financing,  acquisition,  disposition of
assets  or  stock,  merger  or  other  comparable  transaction.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary  contained in the foregoing,  the Contributing  Parties
shall not have the right to effect more than two underwritten offerings pursuant
to this  paragraph and each such offering  shall be required to include  minimum
gross sales proceeds of $17,500,000.

     (f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the General
Partner  shall  have no  obligation  to keep any  registration  statement  filed
pursuant  to this  Section 4.1  effective  after the  Expiration  Date or if the
status of the General  Partner (or its  successor)  as an Exchange Act Reporting
Company is terminated.

     4.2  Reservation of Shares.  At all times while the  Redemption  Rights are
outstanding,  the General  Partner  shall  reserve for  issuance  such number of
Shares as may be necessary to enable the General Partner to issue Shares in full
satisfaction  of all Redemption  Rights which are from time to time  outstanding
(assuming that there are no limitations as to the ownership of such Shares under
the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  which  relate to  compliance  with the REIT
Requirements,  that all Series B Preferred Units have been converted into Common
Units and that the General  Partner elected to pay the Share Purchase Price with
respect to all such Redemption Rights).

     4.3 Fully  Paid and  Non-Assessable.  All Shares  which may be issued  upon
exercise of the  Redemption  Rights  shall be duly and validly  issued and fully
paid and non-assessable.


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

     5. Transfer and Similar  Taxes.  The General  Partner shall pay any and all
documentary  stamp or similar issue or transfer  taxes payable in respect of the
issue or  delivery  of shares of Common  Stock or other  securities  or property
pursuant  hereto;  provided,  however,  that the  General  Partner  shall not be
required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer  involved
in the  issue or  delivery  of shares of  Common  Stock or other  securities  or
property  in a name  other  than that of the  holder of the  Common  Units to be
exchanged,  and no such  issue or  delivery  shall be made  unless and until the
person  requesting  such issue or delivery  has paid to the General  Partner the
amount of any such tax or  established,  to the reasonable  satisfaction  of the
General Partner, that such tax has been paid.

     6. Anti-Dilution and Adjustment Provisions.

     (a) The  Conversion  Factor shall be adjusted in the event that the General
Partner  (i)  declares  or pays a dividend or  distribution  on its  outstanding
Shares in Shares  or makes a  distribution  to all  holders  of its  outstanding
Shares in Shares,  (ii) subdivides its outstanding Shares, or (iii) combines its
outstanding  Shares  into a  smaller  number  of  Shares.  In  such  event,  the
Conversion  Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying  the Conversion  Factor by a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  shall be the  number of Shares  issued  and
outstanding on the record date for such dividend,  distribution,  subdivision or
combination  (assuming  for such  purposes  that  such  dividend,  distribution,
subdivision or combination  has occurred as of such time) and the denominator of
which  shall be the  actual  number  of  Shares  (determined  without  the above
assumption)  issued  and  outstanding  on the  record  date for  such  dividend,
distribution,  subdivision or combination.  In addition,  the Conversion  Factor
shall be  adjusted  in the event that the  Partnership  (i)  declares  or pays a
dividend or distribution on its outstanding  Common Units in Common Units,  (ii)
subdivides  its  outstanding  Common Units,  or (iii)  combines its  outstanding
Common  Units  into a  smaller  number  of  Common  Units.  In such  event,  the
Conversion  Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying  the Conversion  Factor by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the actual number of Shares issued and
outstanding on the record date for such dividend,  distribution,  subdivision or
combination  (determined  without the below  assumption)  and the denominator of
which shall be the number of Shares issued and  outstanding  on such record date
(assuming  for such purposes that such  dividend  distribution,  subdivision  or
combination  has occurred as of such time).  Any  adjustment  to the  Conversion
Factor shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event
retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event.

     (b) If at any time the holders of Common Stock are entitled to any right (a
"Right") to subscribe pro rata for additional securities of the General Partner,
whether Common Stock or other  classifications,  or for any other  securities or
interests  that a  Contributing  Party would have been entitled to subscribe for
if,  immediately prior to such grant, such Contributing  Party had exercised its
Redemption  Rights and received the Share Purchase Price in payment thereof,  in
lieu of any  adjustment  under any other  subsection  of this Section 6 or other
provision of this  Agreement and except to the extent that  provision  otherwise
has been made for such Contributing Party to receive such Right under the Series
B Preferred Unit Designation or otherwise,  such  Contributing  Party also shall
receive  from the General  Partner,  prior to or  concurrent  with the time such
Right becomes  exercisable,  the same Right that such  Contributing  Party would
have been entitled to if such  Contributing  Party had exercised its  Redemption
Rights


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

in  full  and  received  the  Share  Purchase  Price  in  satisfaction   thereof
immediately  prior to the time holders of Common  Stock became  entitled to such
Right.

     (c) Upon the occurrence of a Major  Transaction  Event, the General Partner
shall cause effective  provision to be made so that, upon full conversion of the
Series B Preferred Units of such Contributing Party into Common Units,  exercise
of the Redemption Rights by such  Contributing  Party in respect thereof and the
election of the General  Partner to pay the Purchase Price at any time following
such  Major  Transaction  Event by  means  of the  Share  Purchase  Price,  such
Contributing Party shall have the right to acquire,  in lieu of the Shares which
otherwise would have been issued to such Contributing Party, the kind and amount
of shares  of stock  and  other  securities  and  property  (and the  provisions
contained in Section 4.1 shall apply anew to the extent that such securities are
of a class of  securities  of the  General  Partner  or its  successor  that are
registered  under the Exchange  Act) and interests as would be issued or payable
with respect to or in exchange for the number of Shares  constituting  the Share
Purchase Price as if all Series B Preferred Units of such Contributing Party had
been converted into Common Units,  such Redemption Rights had been exercised and
the General Partner had satisfied the Redemption Rights by delivery of the Share
Purchase Price immediately before such Major Transaction Event.

     (d) The Partnership  shall give written notice to  Contributing  Parties of
any Major  Transaction  Event promptly after such Major Transaction is announced
to the public.

     (e)  Notwithstanding   anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,  the
adjustment  provisions contained in this Agreement and in the Series B Preferred
Unit Designation  shall be applied without  duplication.  The provisions of this
Section 6 shall apply to successive  events that may occur from time to time but
only shall apply to a  particular  event if it occurs  prior to the  exercise in
full of the Redemption  Rights or the  liquidation of the  Partnership.  Nothing
contained  herein  shall  prevent  or  otherwise  limit the  liquidation  of the
Partnership pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, as amended from time to time.

     (f)  Whenever the  Conversion  Factor is adjusted as herein  provided,  the
General Partner shall compute the adjusted  Conversion Factor in accordance with
this Section 6 and shall  prepare a  certificate  signed by the chief  financial
officer of the General Partner setting forth the adjusted  Conversion Factor and
showing in reasonable  detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and
such certificate shall forthwith be filed at the offices of the General Partner.

III. Rank


                                       2
<PAGE>

     The Series C Preferred  Stock,  with  respect to payment of  dividends  and
amounts upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of
the Company, shall be deemed to rank:

     (a)  senior to all  classes  or series of Common  Stock and to all  Capital
Stock of the Company the terms of which  provide that such  Capital  Stock shall
rank junior to the Series C Preferred Stock;

     (b) on a parity with the Series A Preferred  Stock,  the Series B Preferred
Stock and each other series of Preferred  Stock issued by the Company which does
not provide by its express terms that it ranks junior in right of payment to the
Series C Preferred  Stock with  respect to payment of  dividends or amounts upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up; and

     (c) junior to any class or series of Capital  Stock  issued by the  Company
that ranks  senior to the Series C Preferred  Stock in  accordance  with Section
IV(d).

IV.  Voting

     (a)  Holders of shares of the Series C  Preferred  Stock shall not have any
voting rights,  except as provided by applicable  law and as described  below in
this Section IV.

     (b) If and  whenever  six  quarterly  dividends  on the Series C  Preferred
Stock, whether or not earned or declared, shall be in arrears (which shall, with
respect to any such quarterly dividend, mean that any such dividend has not been
paid in full) (a "Preferred  Dividend  Default"),  the number of directors  then
constituting  the Board shall be  increased  by two and the holders of shares of
the Series C Preferred Stock (voting separately as a single class (regardless of
series)  with all other  Capital  Stock of the  Company  upon which like  voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable ("Parity Preferred Stock")) shall
be entitled to elect two additional  directors (the "Preferred Stock Directors")
to serve on the Board at any annual meeting of  stockholders  or special meeting
held in place  thereof,  or at a special  meeting of the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Parity  Preferred Stock called as hereinafter  provided.
Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and the Parity
Preferred Stock then outstanding  shall have been paid and dividends thereon for
the current  Dividend  Period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for
payment,  then the right of the holders of the Series C Preferred  Stock and the
Parity  Preferred  Stock to elect such additional two directors shall cease (but
subject  always to the same  provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in
the case of any similar future arrearages in six quarterly  dividends),  and the
terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of the Series
C Preferred Stock and the Parity  Preferred Stock shall forthwith  terminate and
the  number of the Board  shall be reduced  accordingly.  At any time after such
voting  power  shall  have been so vested in the  holders  of shares of Series C
Preferred  Stock and Parity  Preferred  Stock,  the secretary of the Corporation
may,  and upon the  written  request of any holder of Series C  Preferred  Stock
(addressed to the secretary at the principal office of the  Corporation)  shall,
call a special meeting of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and of the
Parity  Preferred  Stock for the election of the two  directors to be elected by
them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided
in the By-Laws of the Corporation  for a special meeting of the  stockholders or
as required by law. If any such special  meeting  required to be called as above
provided  shall not be called by the  secretary  within 20 days after receipt of
any such request, then any holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock may call
such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that


                                       3
<PAGE>

purpose shall have access to the stock books of the  Corporation.  The directors
elected at any such  special  meeting  shall hold  office  until the next annual
meeting of the  stockholders  or special  meeting  held in lieu  thereof if such
office shall not have previously terminated as above provided.

     (c) So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue,  any vacancy in
the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by written consent of the
Preferred Stock Director  remaining in office,  or if there is no such remaining
director,  by the holders of a majority of the votes of the outstanding Series C
Preferred  Stock and the other  series of  Parity  Preferred  Stock  voting as a
single  class.  Any Preferred  Stock  Director may be removed only for cause and
only by the holders of record of seventy-five  percent (75%) of the votes of the
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock voting separately as a class with
all other series of Parity  Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock Directors shall
each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.

     (d) So long as any shares of Series C Preferred  Stock remain  outstanding,
the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of
at least a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding at the
time,  given in person or by proxy,  either  in  writing  or at a meeting  (such
series  voting  separately  as a class),  (i)  authorize,  create  or issue,  or
increase the  authorized  or issued  amount of, any class or series of shares of
Capital Stock ranking prior to the Series C Preferred  Stock with respect to the
payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon voluntary or involuntary
liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding-up  of  the  Company  or  reclassify  any
authorized  shares of Capital Stock of the Company into such Capital  Stock,  or
create,   authorize  or  issue  any   obligation  or  security   convertible  or
exchangeable into or evidencing the right to purchase any such Capital Stock; or
(ii) amend,  alter or repeal the provisions of the Certificate of  Incorporation
or this  Certificate  of  Designations,  whether by merger or  consolidation  or
otherwise (an  "Event"),  so as to  materially  and adversely  affect any right,
preference,  privilege  or voting  power of the Series C Preferred  Stock or the
holders thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none
of the  following  shall be deemed to materially  and adversely  affect any such
right,  preference,  privilege or voting power or otherwise  require the vote or
consent of the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock: (X) the occurrence
of any Event so long as either (1) the Company is the  surviving  entity and the
Series C Preferred Stock remains  outstanding with the terms thereof  materially
unchanged or (2) interests in an entity having substantially the same rights and
terms as the Series C Preferred Stock are substituted for the Series C Preferred
Stock,  (Y) any increase in the amount of the authorized  Preferred Stock or the
creation or issuance of any other series of  Preferred  Stock or any increase in
the amount of authorized or issued Series C Preferred  Stock or any other series
of  Preferred  Stock,  in each case  ranking  on a parity  with or junior to the
Series  C  Preferred  Stock  with  respect  to  payment  of  dividends  and  the
distribution of assets upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Company,  and (Z) the dissolution,  liquidation and/or winding
up of the Company.

     (e) For purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section IV, each share
of Series C Preferred Stock shall have one (1) vote per share,  except that when
any other series of preferred stock shall have the right to vote with the Series
C Preferred  Stock as a single class on any matter,  then the Series C Preferred
Stock and such other series shall have with respect to such matters one (1) vote
per $25.00 of stated  liquidation  preference.  Except as otherwise  required by
applicable  law or as set forth herein,  the shares of Series C Preferred  Stock
shall not have any  voting  rights  or powers  and the  consent  of the  holders
thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action.

V.   Dividends

     (a) With respect to each  Dividend  Period and subject to the rights of the
holders of shares of  Preferred  Stock  ranking  senior to or on parity with the
Series C Preferred  Stock,  the  holders of shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock
shall be  entitled  to receive,  when,  as and if declared by the Board,  out of
assets of the Company legally available for the payment of dividends,  quarterly
cumulative  cash  dividends  in an amount per share of Series C Preferred  Stock
equal to the greater of (i) $21.25 and (ii) the amount of the regular  quarterly
cash  dividends  for such  Dividend  Period  upon the number of shares of Common
Stock (or portion  thereof)  into which such  Series C  Preferred  Stock is then
convertible  in  accordance  with Section VII hereof  (but,  with respect to any
Dividend Period ending after the Fifteenth  Anniversary Date, no amount shall be
paid in respect of clause  (ii) of this  paragraph  in respect of the portion of
such  Dividend  Period   occurring  after  the  Fifteenth   Anniversary   Date).
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  contained  herein,  the  amount  of
dividends  described  under either clause (i) or (ii) of this  paragraph for the
initial  Dividend  Period,  or any other  period  shorter  than a full  Dividend
Period,  shall be prorated and computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and
a 360-day year. The dividends on the Series C Preferred  Stock for each Dividend
Period shall,  if and to the extent declared or authorized by the Board, be paid
in arrears (without  interest or other amount) on the Dividend Payment Date with
respect thereto, and, if not paid on such date, shall accumulate, whether or not
there are funds  legally  available  for the payment  thereof and whether or not
such dividends are declared or authorized.  The record date for dividends to the
holders of shares of Series C Preferred  Stock for any Dividend  Period shall be
the same as the record date for the dividends to the holders of shares of Common
Stock for such  Dividend  Period  (or,  if no such  record is set for the Common
Stock, the fifteenth day of the calendar month in which the applicable  Dividend
Payment Date falls).  Accrued and unpaid dividends for any past Dividend Periods
may be declared and paid at any time,  without reference to any Dividend Payment
Date,  to holders of record on such date,  not  exceeding 45 days  preceding the
payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board. Any dividend payment made on
the shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall  first be  credited  against the
earliest  accumulated  but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which
remains  payable.  No interest,  or sum of money in lieu of  interest,  shall be
owing or payable in respect of any dividend  payment or payments on the Series C
Preferred Stock, whether or not in arrears.

     (b) No dividend  on the Series C  Preferred  Stock shall be declared by the
Board or paid or set apart for  payment by the Company at such time as the terms
and provisions of any agreement of the Company, including any agreement relating
to its indebtedness,  prohibits such  declaration,  payment or setting apart for
payment or provides that such declaration,  payment or setting apart for payment
would  constitute  a  breach  thereof,  or a  default  thereunder,  or  if  such
declaration or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  dividends  on the Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall  accumulate
whether or not any of the foregoing restrictions exist

     (c) Except as provided in subsection V(d) herein,  so long as any shares of
Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, (i) no dividends (other than in Common
Stock or other  Capital  Stock of the  Company  ranking  junior to the  Series C
Preferred  Stock as to  payment  of  dividends  and  amounts  upon  liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Company) shall be declared or paid or set apart
for payment upon the Common Stock or any other class or series of Capital  Stock
of the Company ranking, as to payment of dividends or amounts distributable upon
liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding-up  of the  Company,  on a parity with or
junior to the Series C


                                       5
<PAGE>

Preferred  Stock, for any period and (ii) no Common Stock or other Capital Stock
of the  Company  ranking  junior to or on a parity  with the Series C  Preferred
Stock as to payment of  dividends or amounts upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or
winding-up of the Company,  shall be redeemed,  purchased or otherwise  acquired
for any  consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking
fund for the  redemption  of any such Capital  Stock) by the Company  (except by
conversion  into or exchange  for other  Capital  Stock of the  Company  ranking
junior to the Series C Preferred  Stock as to payment of  dividends  and amounts
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or by redemptions for
the  purpose  of  maintaining  the  Company's  qualification  as a  real  estate
investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes)  unless,  in the
case of  either  clause  (i) or (ii),  full  cumulative  dividends  have been or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment  thereof set apart for such payment on the Series C Preferred  Stock for
all Dividend  Periods  ending on or prior to the  dividend  payment date for the
Common Stock or such other class or series of Capital  Stock or the date of such
redemption, purchase or other acquisition.

     (d) When  dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full
payment is not set apart for such payment) upon the Series C Preferred Stock and
any other Capital Stock ranking on a parity as to payment of dividends  with the
Series C Preferred  Stock,  all  dividends  declared upon the Series C Preferred
Stock and any other Capital Stock ranking on a parity as to payment of dividends
with the Series C Preferred  Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount
of  dividends  declared  per share of Series C  Preferred  Stock and such  other
Capital  Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued
dividends per share on the Series C Preferred Stock and such other Capital Stock
(which shall not include any  accumulation  in respect of unpaid  dividends  for
prior  dividend  periods  if such  Capital  Stock  does  not  have a  cumulative
dividend) bear to each other.

     (e) The  holders of the  shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall not be
entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends as described in
V(a) above.

VI.  Liquidation Preference

     (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution
or winding-up of the Company,  before any payment or  distribution of the assets
of the Company  (whether  capital or surplus)  shall be made to or set apart for
the holders of Common Stock or any other  Capital  Stock  ranking  junior to the
Series C Preferred Stock as to the  distribution of assets upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Company,  the holders of shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall,  with respect to each such share, be entitled to receive,
out of the assets of the Company  available  for  distribution  to  stockholders
after payment or provision for payment of all debts and other liabilities of the
Company,  an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000.00,  plus an amount equal
to all dividends  (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon
to the date of final  distribution  and (ii) the  amount  that a holder  of such
share of Series C Preferred Stock would have received upon final distribution in
respect of the number of shares of Common  Stock into which such share of Series
C  Preferred  Stock  was  convertible  immediately  prior to such  date of final
distribution  (but no amount  shall be paid in respect of the  foregoing  clause
(ii) after the  Fifteenth  Anniversary  Date).  If, upon any such  voluntary  or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the assets of
the Company, or proceeds thereof,  distributable among the holders of the shares
of Series C Preferred  Stock,  are  insufficient to pay in full the preferential


                                       6
<PAGE>

amount  aforesaid  on the  shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock and  liquidating
payments on any other shares of any class or series of Capital Stock ranking, as
to payment  of  dividends  and  amounts  upon the  liquidation,  dissolution  or
winding-up of the Company,  on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock,  then
such assets, or the proceeds thereof,  shall be distributed among the holders of
shares of Series C Preferred  Stock and any such other parity  stock  ratably in
accordance  with the respective  amounts that would be payable on such shares of
Series C Preferred  Stock and such other stock if all  amounts  payable  thereon
were  paid  in  full.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Section  VI,  none of (i) a
consolidation  or merger of the  Company  with or into  another  entity,  (ii) a
merger of another  entity  with or into the  Company,  (iii) a  statutory  share
exchange  by  the  Company  or  (iv)  a  sale,  lease  or  conveyance  of all or
substantially  all of the  Company's  assets,  properties  or business  shall be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company.

     (b) Written  notice of such  liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of the
Company,  stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where,
the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given
by first class mail,  postage  pre-paid,  not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the payment date stated therein,  to each record holder of the Series C
Preferred  Stock at the  respective  addresses of such holders as the same shall
appear on the stock transfer records of the Company.

     (c) After payment of the full amount of liquidating  distributions to which
they are entitled,  the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have
no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.

VII.  Conversion.  Holders of shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall have
the right to convert  all or a portion of such  shares  into  shares of Common
Stock, as follows:

     (a) A holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right, at
such  holder's  option,  at any time,  to convert any whole  number of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock. Each
share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the number of shares
of Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the $1,000 face amount per each share
of Series C Preferred  Stock plus an amount equal to all  dividends  (whether or
not  earned or  declared)  accrued  and  unpaid  thereon  to the end of the last
Dividend  Period ending prior to the conversion by (ii) the conversion  price of
the  Series B  Preferred  Units as in  effect  as of the date of the  conversion
(equivalent  to an initial  anticipated  conversion  rate of 20 shares of Common
Stock for each share of Series C  Preferred  Stock),  subject to  adjustment  as
described in Section VII(c) hereof (the "Conversion Price"); provided,  however,
that  the  right to  convert  shares  of  Series C  Preferred  Stock  may not be
exercised after the Fifteenth  Anniversary  Date. No fractional shares of Common
Stock will be issued upon any conversion of shares of Series C Preferred  Stock.
Instead,  the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock.

     (b) To exercise the conversion right, the holder of each share of Preferred
Stock to be converted shall surrender the certificate  representing  such share,
duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, at the principal office of
the Company  accompanied  by a written  notice to the Company  (the  "Conversion
Notice")  indicating  that the holder  thereof  elects to convert  such share of
Series C Preferred  Stock.  Unless the shares  issuable on conversion  are to be
issued in the same name as the name in which  such  share of Series C  Preferred
Stock is registered, each share of


                                       7
<PAGE>

Series C Preferred  Stock  surrendered  for  conversion  shall be accompanied by
instruments of transfer,  in form reasonably  satisfactory to the Company,  duly
executed by the holder or such holder's duly  authorized  attorney and an amount
sufficient  to  pay  any  transfer  or  similar  tax  (or  evidence   reasonably
satisfactory to the Company demonstrating that such taxes have been paid).

     As promptly as practicable  after the surrender of certificates  for shares
of Series C Preferred Stock and delivery of the Conversion  Notice as aforesaid,
the Company shall issue and shall  deliver at such office to such holder,  or on
the holder's  written  order, a certificate  or  certificates  for the number of
shares of Common Stock  issuable upon the  conversion of such shares of Series C
Preferred  Stock in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this  Section  VII. In
addition,  the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder a  certificate  or
certificates  evidencing  any  shares  of  Series C  Preferred  Stock  that were
evidenced  by the  certificate  or  certificates  delivered  to the  Company  in
connection with such conversion but that were not converted.

     A holder of shares of Series C Preferred  Stock at the close of business on
the record  date for any  Dividend  Period  shall be  entitled  to  receive  the
dividend  payable on such  shares on the  corresponding  Dividend  Payment  Date
notwithstanding  the  conversion  of such  shares  of Series C  Preferred  Stock
following  such record date and prior to such  Dividend  Payment  Date and shall
have no right to receive any dividend for such Dividend Period in respect of the
shares of Common  Stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred  Stock were
converted.  Except as  provided  herein,  the  Company  shall make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends,  whether or not in arrears,  on converted shares
of Series C Preferred  Stock or for dividends on the shares of Common Stock that
are issued upon such conversion.

     Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected  immediately prior to
the close of business on the date on which the certificates for shares of Series
C  Preferred  Stock shall have been  surrendered  and the  Conversion  Notice is
received by the Company as aforesaid, and the person or persons in whose name or
names any shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be
deemed to have  become the  holder or  holders of record of such  shares at such
time on such  date,  and such  conversion  shall be at the  Conversion  Price in
effect at such time and on such date  unless the  transfer  books of the Company
shall be closed on that date,  in which  event such  person or persons  shall be
deemed to have  become such holder or holders of record at the close of business
on the next  succeeding  day on which  such  transfer  books are open,  but such
conversion  shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the date on which such
shares have been surrendered and such notice received by the Company.

     (c) The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:

     (i) If the  Company  shall,  after the date on which any shares of Series C
Preferred Stock are first issued (the "Issue Date"),  (A) pay or make a dividend
to holders of its Common Stock in Common Stock,  (B)  subdivide its  outstanding
Common Stock into a greater  number of shares of Common Stock or (C) combine its
outstanding  Common Stock into a smaller  number of shares of Common Stock,  the
Conversion  Price in effect at the opening of business on the day  following the
date fixed for the determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or
at the  opening  of  business  on the day next  following  the day on which such
subdivision,  combination or reclassification becomes effective, as the case may
be,  shall be  adjusted  so that the  holder of any share of Series C  Preferred
Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be


                                       8
<PAGE>

entitled to receive the number of shares of Common  Stock that such holder would
have owned or have been  entitled to receive  after the  happening of any of the
events described above had such share of Series C Preferred Stock been converted
immediately  prior to the record date in the case of a dividend or the effective
date  in  the  case  of  a  subdivision,  combination  or  reclassification.  An
adjustment  made  pursuant  to  this  subsection  (i)  shall  become   effective
immediately  after the opening of business on the day next  following the record
date (except as provided in subsection  (g) below) in the case of a dividend and
shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day next
following  the  effective  date in the  case of a  subdivision,  combination  or
reclassification.

     (ii) If the Company  shall issue  after the Issue Date  rights,  options or
warrants to all holders of shares of Common  Stock  entitling  them to subscribe
for or  purchase  shares of  Common  Stock (or  securities  convertible  into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) at a price per share less than the Fair
Market Value per share of Common Stock on the record date for the  determination
of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such rights, options or
warrants,  then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the
day next  following  such  record  date  shall be  adjusted  to equal  the price
determined by multiplying (I) the Conversion Price in effect  immediately  prior
to the  opening  of  business  on the day  following  the  date  fixed  for such
determination by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of (A)
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the
date fixed for such  determination  and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
that the  aggregate  proceeds to the Company  from the  exercise of such rights,
options or  warrants  for shares of Common  Stock  would  purchase  at such Fair
Market Value, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the number of
shares of Common  Stock  outstanding  at the close of business on the date fixed
for such  determination  and (B) the number of additional shares of Common Stock
offered  for  subscription  or  purchase  pursuant  to such  rights,  options or
warrants.  Such adjustment shall become effective  immediately after the opening
of business on the day next  following  such record date  (except as provided in
subsection (g) below).  In determining  whether any rights,  options or warrants
entitle  the  holders of shares of Common  Stock to  subscribe  for or  purchase
shares of Common Stock at less than the Fair Market Value,  there shall be taken
into account any  consideration  received by the Company upon  issuance and upon
exercise of such rights,  options or warrants,  the value of such consideration,
if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of the Company.

     (iii) If the Company  shall  distribute  to all holders of shares of Common
Stock any other securities or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding
those rights,  options and warrants  referred to in and treated under subsection
(ii)  above,  and  excluding  dividends  paid  exclusively  in cash) (any of the
foregoing being  hereinafter in this subsection (iii) called the  "Securities"),
then in each case the Conversion  Price shall be adjusted so that it shall equal
the  price  determined  by  multiplying  (I)  the  Conversion  Price  in  effect
immediately  prior  to  the  close  of  business  on  the  date  fixed  for  the
determination  of holders of shares of Common  Stock  entitled  to receive  such
dividend by (II) a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which shall be the Fair Market
Value per share of Common Stock on the record date mentioned below less the then
fair market value (as  determined  in good faith by the Board of the Company) of
the portion of the securities so  distributed  applicable to one share of Common
Stock,  and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of
Common Stock on the record date mentioned  below.  Such adjustment  shall become
effective  immediately  at the  opening of  business  on the  business  day next
following  (except as provided in subsection  (g) below) the record date for the
determination of


                                       9
<PAGE>

holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution. For the
purposes of this subsection  (iii), a dividend in the form of a Security,  which
is distributed not only to the holders of the shares of Common Stock on the date
fixed for the  determination  of holders of shares of Common  Stock  entitled to
such  distribution of such Security,  but also is distributed with each share of
Common  Stock  delivered  to a person  converting  a share of Series C Preferred
Stock after such  determination  date,  shall not require an  adjustment  of the
Conversion Price pursuant to this subsection  (iii);  provided that on the date,
if any, on which a person  converting a share of Series C Preferred  Stock would
no longer be entitled to receive such Security  with a share of Common Stock,  a
distribution  of such  Securities  shall be  deemed  to have  occurred,  and the
Conversion  Price shall be adjusted  as provided in this  subsection  (iii) (and
such day  shall be deemed to be "the  date  fixed for the  determination  of the
holders of shares of Common Stock  entitled to receive such  dividend"  and "the
record date" within the meaning of the two preceding sentences).

     (iv) No adjustment in the  Conversion  Price shall be required  unless such
adjustment  would  require a  cumulative  increase or decrease of at least 1% in
such  price;  provided,  however,  that any  adjustments  that by reason of this
subsection  (iv) are not required to be made shall be carried  forward and taken
into account in any subsequent  adjustment  until made;  and provided,  further,
that any adjustment shall be required and made in accordance with the provisions
of this Section VII (other than this  subsection  (iv)) not later than such time
as may be required in order to preserve the tax-free nature of a dividend to the
holders of shares of Common Stock.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Section VII,  the Company  shall not be required to make any  adjustment  to the
Conversion  Price for the  issuance  of any Common  Stock  pursuant  to any plan
providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of
the Company and the  investment of additional  optional  amounts in Common Stock
under such plan.  All  calculations  under this Section VII shall be made to the
nearest cent (with $.005 being rounded upward) or to the nearest  one-tenth of a
share (with .05 of a share being rounded  upward),  as the case may be. Anything
in this  subsection  (c) to the contrary  notwithstanding,  the Company shall be
entitled,  to the  extent  permitted  by law,  to make  such  reductions  in the
Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this subsection (c), as it in
its discretion  shall  determine to be advisable in order that any Capital Stock
dividend,  subdivision  of Capital  Stock,  reclassification  or  combination of
Capital Stock,  distribution of rights,  options or warrants to purchase Capital
Stock or securities,  or a  distribution  consisting of other assets (other than
cash  distributions)  hereafter  made by the  Company to its  holders of Capital
Stock shall not be taxable but any such  adjustment  shall not adversely  affect
the value of the Series C Preferred Stock.

     (d) If the Company shall be a party to any transaction (including,  without
limitation, a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, self tender offer
for all or  substantially  all of the  shares  of Common  Stock,  sale of all or
substantially  all of the  Company's  assets or  recapitalization  of the Common
Stock  and  excluding  any  transaction  as to which  subsection  (c)(i) of this
Section  VII  applies)  (each of the  foregoing  being  referred  to herein as a
"Transaction"),  in each case as a result of which  shares of Common Stock shall
be  converted  into the right to  receive  shares,  stock,  securities  or other
property  (including  cash or any combination  thereof),  each share of Series C
Preferred Stock which is not converted into the right to receive shares,  stock,
securities  or  other  property  in  connection  with  such  Transaction   shall
thereafter be convertible into the kind and amount of shares, stock,  securities
and other property  (including cash or any combination  thereof) receivable upon
the  consummation  of such  Transaction  by a holder of that number of shares of
Common  Stock into which one share of Series C Preferred  Stock was  convertible
immediately prior


                                       10
<PAGE>

to such  Transaction,  assuming such holder of Common Stock is not a Person with
which the Company  consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged
into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made,  as the case may be
(a "Constituent  Person"),  or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. The Company
shall not be a party to any Transaction unless the terms of such Transaction are
consistent  with the provisions of this subsection (d), and it shall not consent
or agree to the occurrence of any Transaction until the Company has entered into
an agreement  with the successor or purchasing  entity,  as the case may be, for
the benefit of the  holders of the shares of Series C Preferred  Stock that will
contain  provisions  enabling the holders of shares of Series C Preferred  Stock
that remain outstanding after such Transaction to convert into the consideration
received by holders of shares of Common Stock at the Conversion  Price in effect
immediately  prior to such  Transaction  (with the  holder  having the option to
elect the type of consideration if a choice is offered in the Transaction).  The
provisions  of  this   subsection  (d)  shall   similarly  apply  to  successive
Transactions.

     (e) If:

     (i) the  Company  shall  declare a dividend  on the shares of Common  Stock
(other than a cash dividend) or there shall be a  reclassification,  subdivision
or combination of Common Stock; or

     (ii) the Company shall  authorize the granting to the holders of the shares
of Common Stock of rights,  options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any
Capital Stock of any class or any other rights, options or warrants; or

     (iii) there shall be any  reclassification of the shares of Common Stock or
any  consolidation  or  merger  to which  the  Company  is a party and for which
approval of any  stockholders  of the Company is required,  or a statutory share
exchange  involving  the  conversion  or exchange of shares of Common Stock into
securities or other  property,  or a self tender offer by the Company for all or
substantially  all of the shares of Common Stock, or the sale or transfer of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety; or

     (iv)  there  shall  occur  the   voluntary  or   involuntary   liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Company,

then the Company shall cause to be mailed to the holders of the shares of Series
C Preferred Stock at their addresses as shown on the records of the Company,  as
promptly  as  possible a notice  stating (A) the date on which a record is to be
taken for the purpose of such distribution of rights,  options or warrants,  or,
if a record is not to be taken,  the date as of which the  holders  of shares of
Common Stock of record to be entitled to such distribution of rights, options or
warrants are to be  determined  or (B) the date on which such  reclassification,
subdivision,  combination,  consolidation,  merger, sale, transfer, liquidation,
dissolution  or winding-up is expected to become  effective,  and the date as of
which it is expected  that  holders of shares of Common Stock of record shall be
entitled  to  exchange  their  shares of Common  Stock for  securities  or other
property, if any, deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale,  transfer,  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding-up.  Failure to give or
receive  such  notice or any defect  therein  shall not affect the  legality  or
validity of the proceedings described in this Section VII.


                                       11
<PAGE>

     (f)  Whenever  the  Conversion  Price is adjusted as herein  provided,  the
Company  shall  prepare  a notice of such  adjustment  of the  Conversion  Price
setting  forth  the  adjusted  Conversion  Price  and the  effective  date  such
adjustment  becomes  effective and shall mail such notice of such  adjustment of
the Conversion  Price to the holder of each share of Series C Preferred Stock at
such holder's last address as shown on the records of the Company.

     (g) In any case in which  subsection  (c) of this Section VII provides that
an adjustment  shall become effective on the date next following the record date
for an event,  the Company may defer until the  occurrence of such event issuing
to the  holder of any share of Series C  Preferred  Stock  converted  after such
record date and before the  occurrence  of such event the  additional  shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment  required
by such  event  over and above the  shares of Common  Stock  issuable  upon such
conversion before giving effect to such adjustment.

     (h) For  purposes of this Section VII, the number of shares of Common Stock
at any time outstanding  shall not include any shares of Common Stock then owned
or held by or for the account of the  Company.  The  Company  shall not make any
distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.

     (i) If any action or transaction would require adjustment of the Conversion
Price  pursuant  to more  than one  subsection  of this  Section  VII,  only one
adjustment  shall be made, and such adjustment shall be the amount of adjustment
that has the highest absolute value.

     (j) If the  Company  shall take any action  affecting  the shares of Common
Stock,  other than action  described in this Section VII, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would  materially  and adversely  affect the  conversion
rights of the holders of the shares of Series C Preferred  Stock, the Conversion
Price for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock may be adjusted,  to the extent
permitted  by law, in such  manner,  if any,  and at such time,  as the Company,
determines to be equitable in the circumstances.

     (k)  The  Company  covenants  that  shares  of  Common  Stock  issued  upon
conversion  of the shares of Series C Preferred  Stock shall be validly  issued,
fully paid and  nonassessable.  Prior to the delivery of any securities that the
Company shall be obligated to deliver upon  conversion of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock, the Company shall endeavor to comply with all federal and state
laws and regulations  thereunder  requiring the  registration of such securities
with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof, by any governmental
authority.

     (l) The Company will pay any and all documentary  stamp or similar issue or
transfer  taxes  payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common
Stock or other  securities  or property on  conversion of the shares of Series C
Preferred Stock pursuant hereto;  provided,  however, that the Company shall not
be  required  to pay any tax that may be  payable  in  respect  of any  transfer
involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or other  securities
or  property  in a name other than that of the holder of the Series C  Preferred
Stock to be  converted,  and no such issue or delivery  shall be made unless and
until the person  requesting  such issue or delivery has paid to the Company the
amount of any such tax or  established,  to the reasonable  satisfaction  of the
Company, that such tax has been paid.

VIII. Ownership Limitations

     The shares of Series C Preferred  Stock are subject to the  restrictions on
transferability  and  ownership  provisions  described  in  Article  IV  of  the
Certificate of Incorporation.  The ownership limit as described in Article IV of
the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  (the  "Ownership  Limit")  shall  mean that
ownership  of more than 7.5% of the value of the  outstanding  shares of Capital
Stock of the Company,  including the Series C Preferred  Stock, is restricted in
order to preserve the  Company's  status as a REIT for U.S.  federal  income tax
purposes.  Subject  to  certain  limitations  described  in  Article  IV of  the
Certificate of Incorporation,  the Board may modify the Ownership Limit,  though
the  Ownership  Limit may not be  increased  by the Board to more than 9.8%.  In
addition, Article IV of the Certificate of Incorporation limits the ownership of
"Existing  Holders" (the "Existing Holder Limit") and also limits transfers that
would cause the Company to become  "closely  held" within the meaning of Section
856(h) of the Code.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Certificate of Designations
to be executed in its name and on its behalf by its  __________  and attested to
by its Secretary on this ___ day of ______, 2002.

     who acquires Protected


                                       2
<PAGE>

     Units as the  result  of the  death of a  Protected  Partner  shall  not be

     in the issued GGP Partnership Units is determined,  in whole or in part, by
     reference,  to the transferee's  basis in Protected Units.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing,  a Protected Unit shall cease to constitute a Protected Unit

     sale or exchange transaction in which the transferee's basis is determined,
     in whole or in part, by reference to the adjusted  basis of the  transferor
     Indirect  Owner),  the Protected  Units  treated as held by such  Protected
     Partner  shall be  reduced  such  that  the  Protected  Units  held by such
     Protected Partner shall equal the Protected Units that would have been held

<PAGE>

     the Indirect  Owners directly  received  Protected Units in the Partnership
     Merger and the Indirect Owner had either directly  transferred a portion of
     such  Protected  Units or died holding such  Protected  Units  (taking into
     account all prior transactions  involving the death of an Indirect Owner in
     such  Protected  Partner or the sale or  exchange  of an  Indirect  Owner's
     equity  interest in such  Protected  Partner (other than a sale or exchange
     transaction  in which the  transferee's  basis is determined in whole or in
     part by reference to the adjusted basis of the transferor Indirect Owner)).

          "Qualifying  Debt" shall mean  indebtedness  of GGP  Partnership or JP
     Partnership,   provided  that  (1)  such   indebtedness  is  treated  as  a
     "nonrecourse  liability"  for  purposes  of Section 752 of the Code and the
     Treasury Regulations  thereunder and secured by property or other assets of
     GGP Partnership or JP Partnership,  respectively,  (2) such indebtedness is
     the most senior indebtedness secured by the subject properties, and (3) the
     subject  property or assets securing such  indebtedness  have a fair market
     value, at the time that a Guarantee  Opportunity is offered, at least equal
     to (a) 300% of the aggregate amount of the guarantees provided by Protected
     Partners  hereunder  (together  with any  other  guarantees  provided  with
     respect to such indebtedness),  and (b) 133% of the aggregate amount of all
     indebtedness secured by such property or assets.

          "Recourse  Debt  Covenant  Period" shall have the meaning set forth in
     Section 5(c).

          "Tax Payment Year" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3(a).

     (a) Subject to Section 2(b), GGP and GGP Partnership agree, for the benefit
of each Protected  Partner and the Indirect  Owners of such  Protected  Partner,
that  neither  GGP  Partnership,  JP  Partnership  nor any  entity  in which GGP
Partnership or JP Partnership  holds a direct or indirect interest will directly
or indirectly sell,  transfer,  exchange,  or otherwise dispose of any Protected
Property  or any direct or  indirect  interest  therein (a  "Protected  Property
Disposition")  during the Protected Period.  Any transaction or event (excluding
any sale or exchange of Protected  Units by a Protected  Partner  other than any
transaction or event in which (1) GGP Partnership is merged with or into another
entity and (2) a Protected  Partner is required to exchange its Protected  Units
in a taxable  exchange)  which would cause any Protected  Partner or an Indirect
Owner thereof to recognize or be allocated  gain for federal income tax purposes
with respect to any Protected  Property or direct or indirect  interest  therein
will be treated as a Protected Property Disposition.

     (b) Section 2(a) shall not apply to (i) any  transaction  with respect to a
Protected  Property,  such  as a  transaction  which  qualifies  as  a  tax-free
like-kind exchange under Code Section 1031 or a tax-free contribution under Code
Section 721,  which would not result in the  recognition of income or gain by or
allocation of income or gain to any Protected Partner or its Indirect Owners, or
(ii) the  conveyance  of any  Protected  Property,  in whole or in part,  to any
person in  connection  with a  foreclosure  proceeding  or deed in lieu  thereof
(provided the debt encumbering the property did not exceed seventy-five  percent
(75%) of the  value of such  property  at the  time the debt was  entered  into,
taking into account all other debt encumbering the


                                       4
<PAGE>

property),  or (iii) the condemnation or other taking of any Protected  Property
by  a  governmental  entity  or  authority  in  eminent  domain  proceedings  or
otherwise.

     3. Indemnity for Breach of Obligations set forth in Section 2 by GGP or GGP
Partnership.

     (a) In the event that GGP or GGP  Partnership  breaches its  obligation set
forth in Section 2(a) to any  Protected  Partner or an Indirect  Owner  thereof,
each such  Protected  Partner shall receive from GGP  Partnership  as damages an
amount equal to the aggregate federal,  state and local income taxes incurred by
such  Protected  Partner  (or  Indirect  Owner  thereof) as a result of the gain
recognized by or allocated to such Protected Partner (or Indirect Owner thereof)
with respect to Protected Units by reason of such Protected Property Disposition
plus an additional  amount so that, after the payment by such Protected  Partner
(or Indirect  Owner thereof) of all taxes on amounts  received  pursuant to this
Section 3(a),  such Protected  Partner (or Indirect  Owner  thereof)  retains an
amount equal to its total tax  liability  incurred as a result of the  Protected
Property  Disposition.  In the event of a breach of  Section  2(a)  hereof  with
respect to any Protected  Partner or an Indirect Owner thereof,  GGP Partnership
shall  promptly  notify  such  Protected  Partner in  writing of such  Protected
Property Disposition and of the approximate sales price or other amount realized
for income tax purposes in connection  therewith.  In addition,  GGP Partnership
shall prepare a  computation  of the indemnity  payment,  if any,  owing to such
Protected  Partner under this Section 3(a), which computation shall be delivered
to such  Protected  Partner  no later  than  January  15th of the year (the "Tax
Payment  Year") in which the  Protected  Partner is  required to report the gain
resulting from the Protected  Property  Disposition on such Protected  Partner's
federal income tax return.  GGP  Partnership  shall make any required  indemnity
payment owing to a Protected Partner pursuant to this Section 3(a) no later than
April 1st of the  applicable  Tax Payment  Year.  For purposes of the  preceding
sentence,  (i) all income arising from a transaction or event that is treated as
ordinary  income under the  applicable  provisions  of the Code and all payments
under this Section 3(a) shall be treated as subject to federal,  state and local
income tax at an effective  tax rate imposed on ordinary  income of  individuals
residing  in the  city  and  state  of  residence  of  such  Protected  Partner,
determined  using the maximum  federal  rate of tax on  ordinary  income and the
maximum  state and local rates of tax on ordinary  income then in effect in such
city and state,  (ii) all other  income  arising from the  transaction  or event
shall be subject to federal,  state,  and local income tax at the  effective tax
rate imposed on long-term capital gains of individuals  residing in the city and
state of  residence  of such  Protected  Partner,  determined  using the maximum
federal,  city and state rates on long-term capital gains then in effect,  (iii)
any amounts  giving  rise to a payment  pursuant  to this  Section  3(a) will be
determined   assuming  that  the   transaction  or  event  giving  rise  to  GGP
Partnership's  obligation  to make a payment was the only  transaction  or event
reported on the Protected  Partner's tax return (i.e.,  without giving effect to
any loss carry  forwards  or other  deductions  attributable  to such  Protected
Partner)  and (iv) any amounts  payable  with  respect to state and local income
taxes shall be assumed to be deductible for federal income tax purposes.  In the
case of a Protected  Partner which is a partnership  or  disregarded  entity for
federal income tax purposes,  the preceding  sentence shall be applied  treating
each  Indirect  Owner of such  partnership  as if it were  directly a  Protected
Partner,  and in the  case  of a  corporate  Protected  Partner,  the  preceding
sentence  shall be applied using the highest  marginal rate of tax applicable to
corporations  for federal  income tax  purposes  and state  corporate  income or
franchise  tax purposes.  For purposes of computing  the damages  payable in the
aggregate to the  Protected


                                       5
<PAGE>

Partners  under  this  Section  3(a)  with  respect  to  a  Protected   Property
Disposition,  in no event shall the gain taken into  account with respect to the
Protected  Property  exceed  the amount of gain with  respect to such  Protected
Property that would have been recognized by the Protected  Partners and Indirect
Owners thereof with respect to the Protected  Units if GGP  Partnership had sold
such Protected Property in a fully taxable  transaction on the day following the
closing of the Partnership  Merger for a purchase price equal to the fair market
value of such  Protected  Property at such time,  provided  that for purposes of
computing  such amount the  aggregate  amount of such gain with  respect to such
Protected  Property shall not exceed the Section 704(c) gain stated with respect
to such Protected  Property on Schedule 2 of this Agreement  (after  subtracting
from such scheduled amount any gain  attributable to such scheduled amount which
was  previously  recognized by (a) a Protected  Partner on a transfer of some or
all of its Protected Units to a transferee who is treated as a Protected Partner
with  respect to such  Protected  Units or (b) an Indirect  Owner upon a sale or
exchange  of  some or all of  such  Indirect  Owner's  equity  interest  in such
Protected Partner).

     (b)  Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,  the
sole and  exclusive  rights and remedies of any  Protected  Partner (or Indirect
Owner  thereof) for a breach or violation of the  covenants set forth in Section
2(a) shall be a claim for damages against GGP Partnership, computed as set forth
in Section 3(a),  and no Protected  Partner (or Indirect Owner thereof) shall be
entitled to pursue a claim for specific performance of the covenant set forth in
Section  2(a) or bring a claim  against  any person  that  acquires a  Protected
Property from GGP  Partnership in violation of Section 2(a). If GGP  Partnership
has  breached or violated the covenant set forth in Section 2(a) (or a Protected
Partner (or Indirect Owner  thereof))  asserts that GGP Partnership has breached
or violated the covenant set forth in Section  2(a)),  GGP  Partnership  and the
Protected  Partner agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding  any such  breach or  violation  and the  amount of  damages,  if any,
payable to such Protected  Partner under Section 3(a). If any such  disagreement
cannot be resolved by GGP Partnership  and such Protected  Partner within thirty
(30) days after such breach,  GGP  Partnership  and the Protected  Partner shall
jointly retain a nationally  recognized  independent public accounting firm (the
"Accounting  Firm") to act as an  arbitrator  to  resolve  as  expeditiously  as
possible all points of any such  disagreement  (including,  without  limitation,
whether a breach of the covenant set forth in Section 2(a) has occurred  and, if
so, the amount of damages to which the  Protected  Partner  (or  Indirect  Owner
thereof)  is entitled as a result  thereof,  determined  as set forth in Section
3(a)).  All  determinations  made by the  Accounting  Firm with  respect  to the
resolution  of any breach or violation of the covenant set forth in Section 2(a)
and the amount of damages  payable to the Protected  Partner (or Indirect  Owner
thereof)  under  Section  3(a)  shall be final,  conclusive  and  binding on GGP
Partnership and the Protected  Partner.  The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm incurred in connection with any such determination  shall be shared equally
by GGP Partnership and the Protected Partner.  In the event that GGP Partnership
and a Protected  Partner,  each  having  acted in good faith and with its or his
best efforts to select an  Accounting  Firm,  are unable to retain an Accounting
Firm within  sixty (60) days after the thirty (30) day period  mentioned  above,
then  following the expiration of such sixty (60) day period,  any  disagreement
may be settled in any court of competent jurisdiction.

     4. Section 704(c)  Method.  GGP  Partnership  shall use, and shall cause JP
Partnership  and any other entity in which GGP Partnership or JP Partnership has
a direct or  indirect  interest  to use (to the  extent  not  prohibited  by the
partnership  or  operating  agreement  of  any  entity  being  acquired  by  GGP
Partnership, directly or indirectly, as a result of the Partnership Merger), the
"traditional method" under Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) for purposes of making
allocations  under  Section  704(c) of the Code with  respect to each  Protected
Property to take into account the book-tax  disparities as of the effective time
of the  Partnership  Merger with  respect to such  Protected  Property  and with
respect to any  revaluation of such Protected  Property  pursuant to Regulations
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g),  and 1.704-3(a)(6) with no
"curative allocations," "remedial allocations," or adjustments to other items to
offset the effect of the "ceiling rule."

     5.  Election  by Certain  Former JP Limited  Partners  to Become  Obligated
Partners; Obligation of GGP Partnership to Maintain Certain Recourse Debt.

     (a) GGP and GGP Partnership agree to maintain,  directly or indirectly,  at
all times,  and on a continuous  basis,  with respect to each Protected  Partner
that becomes an Obligated  Partner pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof, an amount of
"recourse" indebtedness, which shall be available to be allocated solely to such
Obligated  Partner for federal  income tax purposes and for which such Obligated
Partner shall solely be reported for federal  income tax purposes as bearing the
"economic  risk of loss"  within the meaning of  Regulation  Section  1.752-2(a)
while such Obligated Partner remains a partner in GGP Partnership,  in an amount
equal to such Obligated  Partner's  Protected Amount, as set forth opposite such
Obligated Partner's name on Schedule 3 to this Agreement, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5(b). The aggregate  amount of such recourse  indebtedness
to be  maintained  by GGP and GGP  Partnership  shall equal the aggregate of the
amounts  shown  as  Protected  Amounts  on  Schedule  3 to this  Agreement  (the
"Aggregate Protected Amount"), as reduced pursuant to the terms hereof.

     (b) GGP and GGP  Partnership  shall adopt,  at the Closing Date, the Fourth
Amendment  (the  "Amendment")  to the Second  Amended and Restated  Agreement of
Limited Partnership of GGP Limited Partnership (the "GGP Partnership Agreement")
in the form set forth as Exhibit E to the Merger Agreement and cause each of the
Obligated  Partners  set  forth  on  Schedule  3 to  this  Agreement  to  become
"Obligated Partners" thereunder with a "Protected Amount" equal to the Protected
Amount shown on such Schedule 3. Upon adoption of the Amendment, all tax returns
filed by GGP  Partnership  shall report  allocations of recourse  liabilities to
each Obligated Partner in an amount equal to such Obligated  Partner's Protected
Amount.  In addition,  any person who acquires,  as a transferee,  the Protected
Units of an Obligated  Partner in a transaction  in which the adjusted  basis of
such transferee in such Protected  Units is determined,  in whole or in part, by
reference  to the  adjusted  basis of the  Obligated  Partner in such  Protected
Units, may elect to become an Obligated Partner by assuming a portion of, or the
full amount of, such transferor  Obligated  Partner's  Protected  Amount. In the
event  of  such a  transfer  and  election  by the  transferee,  the  transferor
Obligated  Partner and the  transferee  electing to become an Obligated  Partner
hereunder  shall notify GGP  Partnership of their  intention that the transferee
become an Obligated Partner in connection with such acquisition,  and Schedule 3
of this  Agreement  and  Exhibit __ of the GGP  Partnership  Agreement  shall be
amended to include  such  transferee  as an  Obligated  Partner with a Protected
Amount in the


                                       7
<PAGE>

amount agreed to by such transferee  Obligated Partner, and the Protected Amount
of the transferor Obligated Partner shall be correspondingly reduced.

     (c) After the period  ending ninety (90) months after the Closing Date (the
"Recourse Debt Covenant Period"), GGP Partnership may satisfy all or any part of
its  obligation  to maintain  recourse  debt  pursuant to Section 5(a) by making
available to each Obligated Partner the opportunity (a "Guarantee  Opportunity")
to make a "bottom  guarantee"  of  Qualifying  Debt in the form of the  Guaranty
Agreement  attached as Schedule 5 hereto and in an amount,  with respect to each
Obligated  Partner,  at least equal to the  difference  between  such  Obligated
Partner's Protected Amount and the amount of recourse debt with respect to which
such  Obligated  Partner  will  continue to "bear  economic  risk of loss" under
Regulation  Section  1.752-2(a)  due to its remaining an Obligated  Partner (the
"Modified Protected Amount") and such Obligated Partner's Protected Amount shall
be reduced to equal its Modified  Protected Amount. In the event that, after the
expiration of the Recourse  Debt  Covenant  Period,  GGP  Partnership  elects to
reduce the amount of  recourse  debt  otherwise  required by Section  5(a),  GGP
Partnership will provide the Obligated  Partners with notice of the type, amount
and other relevant  attributes of the Qualifying  Debt with respect to which the
Guarantee  Opportunity  is offered at least  sixty (60)  business  days,  to the
extent  reasonably  practicable,  but in no event less than thirty (30) business
days prior to GGP  Partnership's  reduction of the level of such recourse  debt.
Upon an Obligated  Partner making a bottom  guarantee of a Qualifying  Debt, all
tax  returns  filed by GGP  Partnership  shall  report  allocations  of recourse
liabilities  to each  Obligated  Partner  in an amount  equal to such  Obligated
Partner's debt guarantee plus its Modified Protected Amount.

     (d) GGP Partnership  makes no  representation  or warranty to any Obligated
Partner that  becoming an Obligated  Partner  pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof or
providing a "bottom  guarantee"  entered  into  pursuant to Section  5(c) hereof
shall be  respected  for federal  income tax  purposes as causing the  Protected
Partner to be considered to "bear the economic risk of loss" with respect to the
indebtedness thereby guaranteed by such Protected Partner for purposes of either
Section 752 or Section 465 of the Code; provided,  however, that GGP Partnership
shall not take any tax position contrary to such position.

     6. Indemnity for Breach of Obligations set forth in Sections 4 and 5 by GGP
or GGP Partnership.

     (a) In the  event  that  GGP  Partnership  breaches  its  obligations  to a
Protected  Partner (or an Indirect  Owner thereof) set forth in Sections 4 or 5,
each such  Protected  Partner shall receive from GGP  Partnership  as damages an
amount equal to the aggregate federal,  state and local income taxes incurred by
such  Protected  Partner  (or  Indirect  Owner  thereof) as a result of the gain
recognized by such  Protected  Partner (or Indirect  Owner thereof) by reason of
such  breach  plus an  additional  amount  so that,  after the  payment  by such
Protected  Partner (or Indirect Owner thereof) of all taxes on amounts  received
pursuant  to this  Section  6(a),  such  Protected  Partner (or  Indirect  Owner
thereof) retains an amount equal to its total tax liability incurred as a result
of such breach (but without regard to any tax liability  incurred as a result of
such Protected Partner's receipt of such indemnity payment).  The principles and
tax rates set forth in Section 3(a) shall also apply for purposes of determining
the timing and amount of payment to be made to a Protected  Partner  pursuant to
this Section 6(a). GGP Partnership shall be considered to have


                                       8
<PAGE>

satisfied its obligations under Section 5, and therefore shall have no liability
under this Section  6(a) for breach of such Section 5, if, after the  expiration
of the Recourse Debt Covenant Period, it offers an Obligated Partner a Guarantee
Opportunity in accordance with Section 5(c) hereof,  and such Obligated  Partner
fails to accept such Guarantee Opportunity.  In no event shall GGP Partnership's
liability  under this Section 6(a) with respect to any  Obligated  Partner for a
breach of Section 5 exceed such Obligated  Partner's  Protected  Amount plus any
additional  amounts  payable so that such  Obligated  Partner  retains an amount
equal to the tax on any gain recognized with respect to such Protected Amount.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,  the
sole and  exclusive  rights and remedies of any  Protected  Partner (or Indirect
Owner  thereof) for a breach or violation of the covenants set forth in Sections
4 and 5 shall be a claim for damages  against GGP  Partnership,  computed as set
forth in Section  6(a),  and no Protected  Partner (or Indirect  Owner  thereof)
shall be entitled to pursue a claim for specific  performance  of the  covenants
set forth in Sections 4 and 5. If GGP  Partnership  has breached or violated the
covenants  set forth in  Sections 4 or 5 (or a Protected  Partner  (or  Indirect
Owner  thereof)  asserts  that GGP  Partnership  has  breached or violated  such
covenants), GGP Partnership and the Protected Partner agree to negotiate in good
faith to resolve any  disagreements  regarding  any such breach or violation and
the amount of damages,  if any, payable to such Protected  Partner under Section
6(a). If any such  disagreement  cannot be resolved by GGP  Partnership and such
Protected Partner within sixty (60) days after such breach,  GGP Partnership and
the  Protected  Partner shall  jointly  retain an  Accounting  Firm to act as an
arbitrator  to  resolve  as  expeditiously  as  possible  all points of any such
disagreement (including,  without limitation,  whether a breach of the covenants
set forth  Section 4 and 5 occurred  and,  if so, the amount of damages to which
the Protected  Partner is entitled as a result thereof,  determined as set forth
in Section 6(a)). All determinations made by the Accounting Firm with respect to
the  resolution of any breach or violation of the covenants set forth in Section
4 and 5 and the amount of damages payable to the Protected Partner under Section
6(a) shall be final, conclusive and binding on GGP Partnership and the Protected
Partner.  The fees and expenses of any  Accounting  Firm  incurred in connection
with any such  determination  shall be shared equally by GGP Partnership and the
Protected  Partner.  In the event that GGP Partnership and a Protected  Partner,
each  having  acted in good faith and with its or his best  efforts to select an
Accounting  Firm, are unable to retain an Accounting Firm within sixty (60) days
after the thirty (30) day period  mentioned  above,  following the expiration of
such  sixty (60) day  period,  any  disagreement  may be settled in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

     7. Effect of Other Agreements With Former JP Limited  Partners.  Schedule 4
to this Agreement sets forth certain obligations of JP Partnership made pursuant
to the JP Tax Protection Agreements.

     8. Notice of Death and Sale Events.  Each  Protected  Partner and Obligated
Partner,  hereby  covenants and agrees to provide,  on its own behalf or through
its legal  representatives,  GGP  Partnership  with prompt written notice of any
transfer of Protected Units or the death of such Protected  Partner or Obligated
Partner.

     9.  Allocations  of Tax Items of GGP  Partnership  for Taxable  Year of the
Partnership Merger.  During the taxable year of GGP Partnership within which the
Merger and the


                                       9
<PAGE>

Partnership  Merger  (the  "Mergers")  are  consummated,   tax  items  shall  be
apportioned  between the portion of such taxable year  preceding the Mergers and
the portion of such taxable year following the Mergers based on a closing of the
books and records of the  relevant  entity or  entities  as of the Closing  Date
(provided that any tax item incurred by reason of  transactions  occurring on or
before the Closing  Date,  as  contemplated  by the Merger  Agreement,  shall be
treated as occurring prior to the Closing Date).

     10.  Section  754  Election.  GGP and GGP  Partnership  covenant  that  GGP
Partnership shall cause GGP Partnership, JP Partnership, and each entity treated
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which GGP Partnership and JP
Partnership  holds a direct or indirect  interest to have in effect for the year
of transfer by a Protected  Partner of Protected Units an election under Section
754 of the Code (to the extent not  prohibited by the  partnership  or operating
agreement  of  any  entity  being  acquired  by  GGP  Partnership,  directly  or
indirectly, as a result of the Partnership Merger).

     11.  Requests  for  Information.  GGP  Partnership  agrees to  provide  the
Protected  Partners  with such  information  as is  reasonably  available to GGP
Partnership  regarding  allocations  of  GGP  Partnership's  indebtedness  under
Section  752 of the  Code  and  the  Treasury  Regulations  thereunder,  as such
Protected Partners may reasonably request.

     12.  Successors and Assigns.  In the event that GGP, GGP Partnership or any
of their  successors or assigns (i)  consolidates  with or merges into any other
person and is not the continuing or surviving  entity of such  consolidation  or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or  substantially  all of its properties
and assets to any person,  then, and in each such case, GGP and GGP  Partnership
shall cause proper  provision to be made so that the  successors  and assigns of
GGP and GGP Partnership  assume the  obligations to the Protected  Partners (and
Indirect Partners thereof) set forth in this Agreement.

     13. Preparation of Schedules 2 and 3. GGP, GGP Partnership,  JP Partnership
and each of the Protected  Partners shall together prepare and complete Schedule
2 (setting  forth the Section  704(c) gain with respect to each of the Protected
Properties) and Schedule 3 (setting forth a Protected  Amount for each Obligated
Partner) on or before the Closing Date;  provided that (I) the final  Schedule 2
shall  reflect (i)  aggregate  Section  704(c)  gain with  respect to all of the
Protected  Properties  of not more than $100.5  million and (ii) Section  704(c)
gain with respect to the Community Centers of not more than $23 million and (II)
Schedule 3 shall  reflect an  Aggregate  Protected  Amount of not more than $100
million.

     14. Third Party Beneficiaries.  GGP and GGP Partnership acknowledge,  agree
and  confirm  that  every  Protected  Partner,  person who  becomes a  Protected
Partner,  and  Indirect  Owner or person that  becomes an  Indirect  Owner is an
intended  third party  beneficiary  of the  provisions of this Agreement and the
provisions of this Agreement are enforceable by any one of them.

     15. General Provisions.

                               GUARANTY AGREEMENT

     THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT  ("Guarantee"),  is dated as of _________,  between
each of the  undersigned  Persons  identified  on  Schedule  1  attached  hereto
("Guarantors"), and [LENDER] ("Guaranteed Party").

     WHEREAS,  [BORROWER] ("Maker"),  is indebted to the Guaranteed Party in the
sum of [LOAN],  as  evidenced  by a certain  promissory  note dated  [DATE] (the
"Note"),  which is secured by a mortgage (the "Mortgage") on certain property of
the Maker (the "Properties" and individually, a "Property").

     WHEREAS,  the Guarantors desire to guarantee collection of a portion of the
principal  amount  of the  Note  not  in  excess  of  [Guaranteed  Amount]  (the
"Guaranteed Amount").

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  for good and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency of which is hereby  acknowledged,  and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Guarantors agree as follows:

     1. Guarantee.

          A. The Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the
     collection  by the  Guaranteed  Party of,  and  hereby  agree to pay to the
     Guaranteed  Party upon demand  (following (1)  foreclosure of the Mortgage,
     exercise  of  the  powers  of  sale  thereunder  and/or  acceptance  by the
     Guaranteed  Party of a deed to a Property in lieu of  foreclosure,  and (2)
     the  exhaustion  of the exercise of any and all  remedies  available to the
     Guaranteed Party against Maker,  including,  without limitation,  realizing
     upon the assets of Maker other than the Properties), an amount equal to the
     excess,  if any,  of the  Guaranteed  Amount  over the Maker  Proceeds  (as
     hereinafter  defined).  The amounts payable by each Guarantor in respect of
     the guarantee  obligations hereunder shall be in the same proportion as the
     amount listed next to such  Guarantor's  name on Schedule 2 attached hereto
     bears to the Guaranteed Amount, provided that,  notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Guarantor's obligation shall
     be  limited  to  the  amount(s)  set  forth  on  Schedule  2 next  to  such
     Guarantor's  name.  The  Guarantors'  obligations  as  set  forth  in  this
     Paragraph 1.A. are hereinafter referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations."

          B. For the purposes of this Guarantee, the term "Maker Proceeds" shall
     mean the aggregate of the  Foreclosure  Proceeds (as  hereinafter  defined)
     plus all other amounts  collected  from the Maker or realized from the sale
     of assets of the Maker other than the Properties by the Guaranteed Party in
     repayment of the Note.


<PAGE>

          C. For the purposes of this Guarantee, the term "Foreclosure Proceeds"
     shall  have the  applicable  meaning  set forth  below  with  respect  to a
     Property:

               1. If at  least  one  bona  fide  third  party  unrelated  to the
          Guaranteed  Party  (and  including,  without  limitation,  any  of the
          Guarantors)  bids for such Property at a sale thereof,  conducted upon
          foreclosure  of the related  Mortgage or exercise of the power of sale
          thereunder, Foreclosure Proceeds shall mean the highest amount bid for
          such  Property by the party that acquires  title thereto  (directly or
          through a nominee) at or pursuant  to such sale.  For the  purposes of
          determining  such  highest  bid,  amounts bid for the  Property by the
          Guaranteed Party shall be taken into account  notwithstanding the fact
          that such bids may  constitute  credit bids which  offset  against the
          amount due to the Guaranteed Party under the Note.

               2. If there is no such unrelated  third-party at such sale of the
          Property so that the only bidder at such sale is the Guaranteed  Party
          or its designee,  the  Foreclosure  Proceeds shall be deemed to be the
          fair market value (the "Fair Market  Value") of the Property as of the
          date of the  foreclosure  sale,  as such Fair  Market  Value  shall be
          mutually  agreed upon by the  Guaranteed  Party and the  Guarantors or
          determined pursuant to Paragraph 1.D.

               3. If the  Guaranteed  Party  receives  and accepts a deed to the
          Property in lieu of  foreclosure  in partial  satisfaction  of Maker's
          obligations  under the Note, the Foreclosure  Proceeds shall be deemed
          to be the  Fair  Market  Value  of  such  Property  as of the  date of
          delivery of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, as such Fair Market Value
          shall  be  mutually  agreed  upon  by the  Guaranteed  Party  and  the
          Guarantors or determined pursuant to Paragraph 1.D.

          D.  Fair  Market  Value of a  Property  shall be the  price at which a
     willing  seller  not  compelled  to sell would  sell such  Property,  and a
     willing  buyer not compelled to buy would  purchase the Property,  free and
     clear of all  mortgages but subject to all leases and  reciprocal  easement
     and operating agreements. If the Guaranteed Party and Guarantors are unable
     to agree  upon the Fair  Market  Value of a  Property  in  accordance  with
     subparagraphs  1.C.2. or 3. above,  as applicable,  within twenty (20) days
     after the date of the foreclosure  sale or the delivery of the deed-in-lieu
     of  foreclosure,  as applicable,  relating to a Property,  either party may
     have the Fair  Market  Value  of a  Property  determined  by  appraisal  by
     appointing  an  appraiser  having  the  qualifications  set forth  below to
     determine  the same and by  notifying  the other party of such  appointment
     within  twenty  (20) days  after the  expiration  of such  twenty  (20) day
     period.  If the other  party shall fail to notify the first  party,  within
     twenty  (20) days  after its  receipt of notice of the  appointment  by the
     first party, of the  appointment by the other party of an appraiser  having
     the  qualifications  set forth below, the appraiser  appointed by the first
     party  shall  alone  make the  determination  of such  Fair  Market  Value.
     Appraisers  appointed  by the  parties  shall be members  of the  Appraisal
     Institute  (MAI)  and  shall  have at least ten  years'  experience  in the
     valuation of properties similar to the Property being valued in the greater
     metropolitan  area in which such  Property is located.  If each party shall
     appoint an  appraiser  having  the  aforesaid  qualifications  and such two
     appraisers cannot, within thirty


                                       2
<PAGE>

     (30) days after the  appointment  of the second  appraiser,  agree upon the
     determination   hereinabove  required,  then  they  shall  select  a  third
     appraiser which third  appraiser  shall have the aforesaid  qualifications,
     and if they fail so to do within forty (40) days after the  appointment  of
     the second appraiser they shall notify the parties hereto, and either party
     shall  thereafter  have the right, on notice to the other, to apply for the
     appointment of a third appraiser to the chapter of the American Arbitration
     Association or its successor  organization located in the metropolitan area
     in which the  Property is located or to which the  Property is proximate or
     if  no  such  chapter  is  located  in  such  metropolitan   area,  in  the
     metropolitan  area  closest  to the  Property  in which  such a chapter  is
     located.  Each  appraiser  shall  render its decision as to the Fair Market
     Value of the  Property  in  question  within  thirty  (30)  days  after the
     appointment of the third  appraiser and shall furnish a copy thereof to the
     Guaranteed  Party and  Guarantors.  The Fair Market  Value of the  Property
     shall  then be  calculated  as the  average  of (i) the Fair  Market  Value
     determined  by the third  appraiser  and (ii)  whichever of the Fair Market
     Values  determined by the first two appraisers is closer to the Fair Market
     Value determined by the third  appraiser;  provided,  however,  that if the
     Fair Market Value determined by the third appraiser is higher or lower than
     both Fair Market Values  determined by the first two appraisers,  such Fair
     Market Value determined by the third appraiser shall be disregarded and the
     Fair Market Value of the Property  shall then be  calculated as the average
     of the Fair Market Value  determined by the first two appraisers.  The Fair
     Market Value of a Property as so determined shall be binding and conclusive
     upon the Guaranteed Party and Guarantors. Each party shall bear the cost of
     its own  appraiser  and the cost of  appointing,  and the  expenses of, the
     third  appraiser  shall be  shared  equally  by the  Guaranteed  Party  and
     Guarantors.

     2. Waivers: Other Agreements.

     The Guaranteed Party is hereby authorized, without notice to or demand upon
Guarantors,  which  notice or demand is  expressly  waived  hereby,  and without
discharging or otherwise  affecting the enforceability of the obligations of the
Guarantors   hereunder   (which   shall  remain   absolute   and   unconditional
notwithstanding any such action or omission to act), from time to time to:

          (i) waive or otherwise consent to noncompliance  with any provision of
     the Note or  Mortgage,  or any part  thereof,  or any other  instrument  or
     agreement  in  respect  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  now  or  hereafter
     executed  by Maker or any other  person  and  delivered  to the  Guaranteed
     Party;

          (ii) accept partial payments on the Guaranteed Obligations by Maker;

          (iii) receive, take and hold additional security or collateral for the
     payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or for the payment of this Guarantee,
     or for the payment of any other  guarantees of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
     and exchange, enforce, waive, substitute,  liquidate,  terminate,  abandon,
     fail to perfect,  subordinate,  transfer, or otherwise alter or release any
     such additional security or collateral;

          (iv)  apply any and all such  security  or  collateral  and direct the
     order or manner


                                        3
<PAGE>

     of  sale  thereof  as the  Guaranteed  Party  may  determine  in  its  sole
     discretion;

          (v) settle,  release,  compromise,  collect or otherwise liquidate the
     Guaranteed  Obligations  or  accept,   substitute,   release,  exchange  or
     otherwise  alter,  affect or impair any  Mortgage or any other  security or
     collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guarantee therefore,
     in any manner;

          (vi) add,  release or  substitute  any one or more  other  guarantors,
     makers or endorsers of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and otherwise deal with
     Maker or any other guarantor as the Guaranteed  Party may elect in its sole
     discretion; and

          (vii) apply any and all payments or recoveries from Maker,  Guarantors
     or from any other guarantor of the Guaranteed  Obligations,  to such of the
     Guaranteed  Obligations as the Guaranteed  Party in its sole discretion may
     determine,  whether such Guaranteed Obligations are secured or unsecured or
     guaranteed or not guaranteed by others.

     3. Miscellaneous.

          A. This  Guarantee is  irrevocable as to any and all of the Guaranteed
     Obligations  until the earliest  date (the  "Termination  Date") that, as a
     result of a repayment,  compromise or  adjustment of a principal  amount of
     the Note, the total principal amount  outstanding under the Note is reduced
     by an amount  equal to or greater  than the  Guaranteed  Amount,  or if the
     Maker incurs  indebtedness senior to, or pari passu with the Note, provided
     that the  obligations of the Guarantors  hereunder shall continue after the
     Termination  Date to the extent of any claims that are  attributable  fully
     and solely to an event or action that occurred before the Termination Date.

          B. This Guarantee is binding on the  Guarantors  and their  successors
     and assigns, and inures to the benefit of the Guaranteed Party.

          C. No delay on the part of the Guaranteed Party in the exercise of any
     right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial
     exercise  or waiver by the  Guaranteed  Party of any right or remedy  shall
     preclude any further exercise thereof, nor shall any modification or waiver
     of any of the  provisions of this  Guarantee be binding upon the Guaranteed
     Party,  except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed or delivered
     by  the  Guaranteed  Party  or  on  the  Guaranteed  Party's  behalf  by an
     authorized officer or agent of the Guaranteed Party. The Guaranteed Party's
     failure at any time or times  hereafter to require  strict  performance  by
     Maker, Guarantors or any other person of any of the provisions, warranties,
     terms and  conditions  contained  in any  security  agreement,  agreements,
     guarantee,  instrument  or document  now or at any time or times  hereafter
     executed by Maker or Guarantors or delivered to the Guaranteed  Party shall
     not waive, affect or diminish any right of the Guaranteed Party at any time
     or times  hereafter  to demand  strict  performance  thereof and such right
     shall  not be deemed to have  been  waived by any act or  knowledge  of the
     Guaranteed Party, its agents, officers, or employees, unless such waiver is
     contained in an instrument in writing  signed by an officer or agent of the
     Guaranteed Party and directed to Maker or Guarantors, or either of them (as
     the case may be) specifying such waiver.  No waiver by the Guaranteed Party


                                        4
<PAGE>

     of any default  shall  operate as a waiver of any other default or the same
     default  on a  future  occasion,  and no  action  by the  Guaranteed  Party
     permitted  hereunder  shall in any way  affect  or  impair  the  Guaranteed
     Party's rights or the obligations of Guarantors under this Guarantee.

          D. This Guarantee  shall be interpreted and the rights and liabilities
     of the parties  hereto  determined in accordance  with the laws (other than
     the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of [New York].

          E.  This  Guarantee  contains  all the  terms  and  conditions  of the
