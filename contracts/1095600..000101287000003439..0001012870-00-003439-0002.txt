and Restated Investors\' Rights Agreement Exhibit C - Irrevocable Proxy and
Voting Agreement Exhibit D - Escrow Agreement Exhibit E - Acquiror\'s Legal
Opinion Exhibit F - Target\'s Legal Opinion   iii    AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF REORGANIZATION   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of June 3, 2000, by and among
CacheFlow Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquiror"), Wildcat Merger
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), SpringBank Networks,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Target"), and Soren Christensen (as
Stockholders\' Agent).   RECITALS   A. The Boards of Directors of Target,
Acquiror and Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and the stockholders and their respective companies that
Target and Merger Sub combine into a single company through the statutory
merger of Merger Sub with and into Target (the "Merger") and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Merger.   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other
things, each outstanding share of capital stock of Target, par value $.001
per share ("Target Capital Stock"), shall be converted into shares of common
stock of Acquiror, par value $.0001 per share ("Acquiror Common Stock"), at
the rate set forth herein.   C. Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub desire to
make certain representations and warranties and other agreements in
connection with the Merger.   D. The parties intend, by executing this
Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section
368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to
consistently report the Merger as a reorganization under the provisions of
Sections 368(a) of the Code.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
covenants and representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I 
---------   THE MERGER  ----------   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and  ---------- subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger") and the 
--------- applicable provisions of the California Corporations Code
("California Law") and the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Target, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Target shall continue as the
surviving corporation. Target as the surviving corporation after the Merger
is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   
1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the transactions 
----------------------- contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place
as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof or at such other time as the
parties hereto agree (the date on which the Closing shall occur, the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer
Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP - Menlo Park, California, or at
such other location as the parties hereto agree. On the Closing Date, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the
Certificate of Merger, together with the required officers\' certificates,
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time and date of such filing being
the "Effective Time" and the "Effective Date," respectively).   1.3 Effect
of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the 
-------------------- Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Target shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Target shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. 
------------------------------------   (a) At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law
and such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that Article I of
the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The
name of the corporation is SpringBank Networks, Inc."   (b) The Bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   1.5
Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors of 
---------------------- Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until
such time as such directors resign, are removed or their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such time as such officers
resign, are removed or their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. By virtue of the
Merger and without any  ----------------------- action on the part of
Acquiror, Merger Sub, Target or the holders of any of Target\'s
securities:   (a) Conversion of Target Capital Stock. At the Effective
Time,  ---------------------------------- each share of Target Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of Target Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
and shares, if any, held by persons who have not voted such shares for
approval of the Merger and with respect to which such persons shall be
entitled to exercise dissenter\'s rights in accordance with Section 262 of
the Delaware Law and Chapter 13 of the California Law ("Dissenting  
2   Shares") will be canceled and extinguished and be converted
automatically into the right to receive one-fifth (1/5) of a share of
Acquiror Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"). The shares to be issued
pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) are referred to herein as the "Total Acquiror
Shares."   (b) Cancellation of Target Capital Stock Owned by Acquiror or 
--------------------------------------------------------- Target. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital Stock that are owned ------ by
Target as treasury stock, each share of Target Capital Stock owned
by Acquiror or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror or
of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) Target Stock Plan.
At the Effective Time, the Target 2000  ----------------- Stock Incentive
Plan (the "Target Stock Plan") and all options to purchase shares of Target
Common Stock ("Target Options") then outstanding under the Target Stock Plan
shall be assumed by Acquiror in accordance with Section 5.13.   (d) Capital
Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each 
--------------------------- share of Common Stock of Merger Sub, par value
$.0001 per share ("Merger Sub Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock,
par value $.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange
Ratio shall be  ----------------------------- adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Acquiror Common Stock
or Target Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Acquiror Common Stock or Target Capital Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (f)
Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common 
----------------- Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Target Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares
of Acquiror Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from
Acquiror an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing
price for a share of Acquiror Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National
Market for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding and ending on the
trading day that is five (5) trading days prior to the Closing Date (the
"Closing Price").   (g) Dissenters\' Rights. Any Dissenting Shares shall not
be  ------------------ converted into Acquiror Common Stock but shall
instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Delaware Law or California Law. Target agrees that, except with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, or as required under Delaware Law or California
Law, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such purchase demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares
("Dissenting Stockholders") who, pursuant to the provisions of Delaware
Law   3   or California Law, becomes entitled to payment of the fair
value for shares of Target Capital Stock, shall receive payment therefor (but
only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Acquiror
shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such stockholders of certificate
or certificates representing shares of Target Capital Stock, the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such stockholders would otherwise be
entitled under this Section 1.6 and the Certificate of Merger less the number
of shares allocable to such stockholders that have been or will be deposited
in the Escrow Fund (as defined below) in respect of such shares of Acquiror
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7(c) and Article VIII hereof.   1.7
Surrender of Certificates.  -------------------------   (a) Exchange Agent.
Boston EquiServe shall act as exchange agent  -------------- (the "Exchange
Agent") in the Merger.   (b) Acquiror to Provide Common Stock and Cash.
Promptly after  ----------------------------------------- the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as
Acquiror may adopt, (i) the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for shares of Target Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time less (i) the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be deposited into an escrow fund (the
"Escrow Fund") pursuant to the requirements of Article VIII hereof and (ii)
cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f).   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly
after the Effective Time, the  ------------------- Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock, whose shares
were converted into the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares) pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of
the Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Acquiror, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror
Common Stock, less the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be
deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder\'s behalf pursuant to Article
VIII hereof, and payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares
of Target Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence
the ownership of the number of full shares of Acquiror Common Stock into
which such shares of Target Capital Stock shall have   4   been so
converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance
of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8.3 hereof, Acquiror shall cause to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 8.3 hereof) a
certificate or certificates representing ten percent (10%) of the Acquiror
Common Stock held by each of the Founders (as defined in Section 5.14
hereof), the Jaworski Entities (as defined in Section 5.14 hereof) and the
Sequoia Funds (as defined in Section 5.14 hereof) (collectively, the "Escrow
Shares") which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee
for the holders of Certificates cancelled pursuant to this Section 1.7. Such
shares shall be beneficially owned by such holders and shall be held in
escrow and shall be available to compensate Acquiror for certain damages as
provided in Article VIII. To the extent not used for such purposes, such
shares shall be released, all as provided in Article VIII hereof.   (d)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No 
------------------------------------------------ dividends or other
distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate surrenders such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time which would have been previously payable (but for the
provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such shares of Acquiror
Common Stock.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares
of  ---------------------- Acquiror Common Stock is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Acquiror or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Acquiror or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  ------------ this
Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
any party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.   (g) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 1.7
shall  ----------------- also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their
status as such, except that the obligations of Acquiror under this Section
1.7 shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of such
shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6 hereof.   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Target Capital
Stock. All shares  --------------------------------------------------- of
Acquiror Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares
of Target Capital   5   Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Target Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Target
Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.   1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the
event any  -------------------------------------- Certificates shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Acquiror Common
Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.6; provided, however, that Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   1.10 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the  ---------------- Merger shall be treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. No party shall take any action
which would, to such party\'s knowledge, be inconsistent with treatment as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.   1.11
Exemption from Registration. The shares of Acquiror Common Stock 
--------------------------- to be issued in connection with the Merger will
be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by reason of Section 4(2) thereof
and under Section 25103(h) of the California Corporations Code. The
registration of the shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") and their resale shall be subject to the terms and conditions of a
registration rights agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Amended and
Restated Investors\' Rights Agreement").  ---------   1.12 Taking of
Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after 
------------------------------------------ the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession
to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target,
the officers and directors of Target and Merger Sub are fully authorized in
the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and shall
take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not
inconsistent with this Agreement.   ARTICLE II  ----------  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET 
----------------------------------------   Target represents and warrants to
Acquiror and Merger Sub that the statements contained in this Article II are
true and correct, except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by
Target to Acquiror prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Target Disclosure Letter"). The Target Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
in paragraphs   6   corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs
contained in this Article II, and the disclosure in any paragraph (including
any cross references) shall qualify only the corresponding paragraph in this
Article II. Any reference in this Article II to an agreement being
"enforceable" shall be deemed to be qualified to the extent such
enforceability is subject to (i) laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and the relief of debtors, and (ii) the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.   2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Target is a corporation
duly  -------------------------------- organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Target has
the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its business and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.2) on Target. Target has
delivered to Acquiror a true and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws or other charter documents, as applicable, of
Target, each as amended to date. Target is not in violation of any of the
provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents. Target does not directly or indirectly own or
control any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity.   2.2 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Target 
----------------- consists of 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,200,000
shares of Preferred Stock, of which there were issued and outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement 12,538,500 shares of Common Stock and 1,102,941
shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred"). There are no
other outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities and no
outstanding commitments to issue any shares of capital stock or voting
securities after the date of this Agreement other than pursuant to the
exercise of options outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the
Target Stock Plan. All outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non- assessable and are free of
any liens or encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or
imposed upon the holders thereof, and are not subject to preemptive rights,
rights of first refusal, rights of first offer or similar rights created by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Target or any
agreement to which Target is a party or by which it is bound. As of the date
of this Agreement, Target has reserved (i) 1,102,941 shares of Common
Stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred, (ii) 7,300,000
shares of Common Stock for issuance to employees, directors and consultants
pursuant to the Target Stock Plan, of which 6,288,500 shares have been issued
pursuant to option exercises or direct stock purchases, 385,000 shares are
subject to outstanding, unexercised options, and (iii) no shares subject to
outstanding warrants. Except for (i) the rights created pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) Target\'s right to repurchase any unvested shares under
the Target Stock Plan, there are no other options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character to which Target is a party or by
which it is bound obligating Target to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or
redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any
shares of Target Capital Stock or obligating Target to grant, extend,
accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter
into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. There
are no contracts, commitments or agreements relating to the voting, purchase
or sale of Target Capital Stock (i) between or among Target and any of its
stockholders and (ii) to the best of Target\'s knowledge, among any of
Target\'s stockholders or between any of Target\'s   7   stockholders and
any third party, except for the stockholders delivering Irrevocable Proxies
(as defined below). The terms of the Target Stock Plan permit the assumption
of such Target Stock Plan by Acquiror or the substitution of options to
purchase Acquiror Common Stock as provided in this Agreement, without the
consent or approval of the holders of the outstanding options, the Target
stockholders, or otherwise and without any acceleration of the
exercise schedule or vesting provisions in effect for such options. True and
complete copies of all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under
the Target Stock Plan have been made available to Acquiror, and such
agreements and instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented,
and there are no agreements to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or
instruments from the form made available to Acquiror. All outstanding Common
Stock and Series A Preferred was issued in compliance with all applicable
federal and state securities laws.   2.3 Authority.  ---------   (a)
Target has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, the Amended and Restated Investors\'
Rights Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (collectively, the "Transaction
Documents") and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Target, subject only to the approval of the
Merger by Target\'s stockholders as contemplated by Section 6.1(a). This
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents have been duly executed and
delivered by Target and constitute the valid and binding obligations of
Target enforceable against Target in accordance with their terms.   (b) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
by Target do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

by Acquiror under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions set forth in the Target Stock Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such   26   option shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Target Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Target Common Stock at which such option was

rounded up to the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the parties that
the options so assumed by Acquiror qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
such options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time. Within 20 business days after the Effective Time, Acquiror will issue
to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of
an outstanding option under the Target Stock Plan a document in form and
substance satisfactory to Target evidencing the foregoing assumption of such
option by Acquiror.   (b) Acquiror shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve and make available for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock for delivery under Target Stock Options assumed in
accordance with this Section 5.13. Within twenty (20) days following the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of
Acquiror Common Stock subject to such options to the extent permitted by law

reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable

contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the appropriate   27   vote of
stockholders of Target described in Section 5.3, including cooperating fully
with the other party, including by provision of information. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving

immunities and franchises of either of the Target or the Acquiror, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such
necessary action. Acquiror shall prepare and properly file on behalf of

Target shall provide Acquiror with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested in connection with the preparation of such Tax Returns.   5.17
Employee Benefits. Acquiror shall take such reasonable actions, to 
----------------- the extent permitted by Acquiror\'s benefits program, as
are necessary to allow eligible employees of Target to participate in the
benefit programs of Acquiror, or alternative benefits programs in the
aggregate substantially comparable to those applicable to employees of
Acquiror on similar terms, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time of
the Merger. For purposes of satisfying the terms and conditions of such
programs, to the extent permitted by Acquiror\'s benefit programs, Acquiror
shall use reasonable efforts to give full credit for eligibility, or vesting
for each participant\'s period of service with Target.   5.18
Indemnification Agreements. From and after the Effective Time,

officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Parties") and made a part of the Target Disclosure Letter, and any
indemnification provisions under the Target Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Target Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of three (3)

the provisions of Section 8.1, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation (on or
after the Closing Date) shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Former

accordance with GAAP) Damages in an aggregate stated amount with respect to
which Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation is entitled to payment from the
Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement; and   35    (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Damages included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was incurred, paid or properly accrued (in
accordance with GAAP), or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the
specific nature of the breach to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.7 of this Agreement, deliver to
Acquiror shares of Acquiror Common Stock in an amount necessary to indemnify
Acquiror for the Damages claimed; provided, however, that no shares of
Acquiror Common Stock shall be delivered to Acquiror, as a result of a claim
based upon an accrual or upon a reasonable probability of having to incur,
pay or accrue Damages until such time as the Acquiror has actually incurred
or paid Damages. All shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such claims
shall remain in the Escrow Fund until Damages are actually incurred or paid

Damages will be required to be incurred or paid (in which event such shares
shall be distributed to the Former Target Stockholders in accordance with
Section 8.10 below).   (b) For the purpose of compensating Acquiror for its
Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Acquiror Common Stock in the Escrow
Fund shall be valued at the Closing Price.   8.7 Objections to Claims. At

Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent
and to Acquiror prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day
period.   8.8 Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration. 
------------------------------------   (a) In case the Stockholders\' Agent
shall so object in writing to any claim or claims by Acquiror made in any
Officer\'s Certificate, the Stockholders\' Agent and Acquiror shall attempt
in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholders\' Agent and
Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
shall distribute the Acquiror Common Stock or other property from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.   (b) If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation, either Acquiror or the Stockholders\'
Agent may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter
unless the amount of the Damage is at issue in pending litigation with a  
36   third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until
such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in
either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by
three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is
sent, Acquiror and the Stockholders\' Agent shall each select one arbitrator,
and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The
decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in
such Officer\'s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties
to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 8.6 hereof, the

parties to this Agreement and the Former Target Stockholders. No bond shall
be required of the Stockholders\' Agent, and the Stockholders\' Agent shall
receive no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholders\' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Target stockholders.   (b) The Stockholders\' Agent shall not be liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders\' Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of
such good faith. The Target stockholders shall severally indemnify the
Stockholders\' Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders\' Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder.   (c) The Stockholders\' Agent
shall have reasonable access to information about Target and the reasonable
assistance of Target\'s officers and employees for purposes of performing its
duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Stockholders\'

Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Acquiror may rely upon any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders\' Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Target Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Acquiror are hereby relieved from
any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders\' Agent.  
8.12 Third-Party Claims. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a 
------------------ third-party claim which Acquiror believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Fund, Acquiror shall promptly notify the
Stockholders\' Agent of such claim. Acquiror shall have the right to settle
any such claim with the written consent of the Stockholders\' Agent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the
Stockholders\' Agent may, at his option, direct the settlement negotiations
other than for claims related to (i) the intellectual property of Target or
(ii) disputes or disagreements with customers of Acquiror or Target. In the

Target or Acquiror, Acquiror shall have the option to defend any such
proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholders\' Agent;
provided, however, that Acquiror shall not admit any liability with respect
thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge the same without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders\' Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Stockholders\' Agent or Acquiror, whichever is not
controlling the defense of any matter, shall be entitled to participate in
such defense, at Acquiror\'s or the Former Target Stockholders\' expense.
