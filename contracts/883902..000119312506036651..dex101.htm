intellectual property rights in the conduct of the Acquired Business. No
governmental registration of any of the Proprietary Rights scheduled in

Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof has ever been a party to any agreement
with any union, labor organization or collective bargaining unit or a member

have) (i) satisfied any requirement for notice of the transactions this
Agreement contemplates under applicable collective bargaining agreements and
(ii) provided NCI with proof that any such required notice has been sent.

retire or any of its former employees who have retired except as the
continuation of coverage provisions of Section 4980B of the Code and the
applicable parallel provisions of ERISA may require.



Section 4.18 _Compliance With _ _Applicable Law_. (a) Compliance. Each of the

the Reorganization Date and the



 

\- 24 - Closing, the Company) nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof has made a complete or
partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan so as to incur withdrawal
liability as defined in Section 4201 of ERISA. Any trust funding a Plan, which
is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code, satisfies the requirements of that Section and has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding that exempt status and
has not, since receipt of the most recent favorable determination letter, been

or (l) of Section 502 of ERISA or (iii) any excise tax under applicable
provisions of the Code.

has engaged in any Prohibited Transaction. No Plan or ERISA Affiliate Pension
Plan has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency, as defined in Section
412(a) of the Code and Section 302(a) of ERISA and, to the knowledge of RCC,
no circumstances exist as a result of which the Acquired Business or the
Company could have any direct or indirect liability whatsoever (including
being subject to any statutory Lien to secure payment of any such liability),
to the PBGC under Title IV of ERISA or to the IRS for any excise tax or
penalty with respect to any Plan or ERISA Affiliate Pension Plan maintained
or contributed to by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates. Further:

Company will not have) incurred liability under Section 4062 of ERISA.

Company), each Tax shown to be payable on each such Return has been timely
paid in full, each Tax payable by RCC, the Company, their respective
Subsidiaries and the Acquired Business by assessment has been timely paid in
the amount assessed and adequate reserves have been established on the books
of the Acquired Business for all Taxes for which RCC, the Company, their
respective Subsidiaries or the Acquired Business is liable, but the payment of
which is not yet due. RCC, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries and the
Acquired Business have timely filed declarations of estimated Tax in
each jurisdiction in which any such declaration is required to be filed by it
and each such declaration is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. No Liens for Taxes exist upon the property or other assets of RCC,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the Acquired Assets,
in each case except Liens for Taxes which are not yet due. None of RCC, the
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or the Acquired Business is or

Subsidiaries or the Acquired Business and no notification has been received
by RCC or the Company that any such audit is threatened. No Litigation with
respect to any Tax for which RCC, the Company, any of their respective

or the Acquired Business is or may be liable has been granted to any Taxing
Authority. None of RCC, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or
the Acquired Business is a party to any closing agreement pursuant to Section
7121 of the Code or any comparable provision of any other Tax statute. RCC,
the Company, their respective Subsidiaries and the Acquired Business are not
a party to any tax allocation, indemnity or sharing agreement. All amounts
required to be withheld by RCC, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries or
the Acquired Business and paid to governmental agencies for income, social
security, unemployment insurance, sales, excise, use and other Taxes have
been collected or withheld and paid to the proper Taxing Authority. RCC, the
Company, their respective Subsidiaries and the Acquired Business have made all
deposits required by law to be made with respect to employees withholding
and other employment taxes.



(c) None of the Company, RCC, or their respective Subsidiaries is a "foreign
person," as Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code refers to that term.

agreement that could require it to make any payment that is not deductible

Section 6.4 _Governmental Filings, including Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
Compliance._ NCI, the Company, RCC and Heico shall cooperate with one another
and assist each other:



(a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals, or
waivers are required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and



(b) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.



 

\- 31 - Each of NCI, the Company, RCC and Heico, as appropriate or required, shall
file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice any notifications required to be filed under the
HSR Act and to request early termination in connection with such filings with
respect to the transactions contemplated herein. Each of the filing parties
shall use its best efforts to make such filings as promptly as practicable; to
respond to any requests for additional information at the earliest practicable
date; to cooperate with the other party in connection with any filings
or submissions to, or conferences with, any Governmental Authorities with
respect to the Acquisition; to keep the other party reasonably and promptly
informed of all developments and communications with any Governmental
Authority with respect to HSR Act matters; to provide copies of all documents
and correspondence to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing
and, if requested, to accept all reasonable modifications suggested in
connection therewith; not to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority unless it consults with the other party in advance (to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority and subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement); to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or
expire at the earliest possible date; and to resist vigorously, at their
respective cost and expense, any assertion that the transactions contemplated
herein constitute a violation of the antitrust laws, all to the end of
expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated herein; provided,
however, that none of RCC, NCI or the Company shall be required to institute
or defend legal proceedings if that party shall determine that such legal
proceedings shall constitute or are reasonably likely to cause a Material
Adverse Effect on such party; in such event, that party may, by written notice
to the other parties, terminate this Agreement with the effect set forth in
Article 9. NCI shall be under no obligation to limit, curtail or divest of
any of its existing businesses or the business it conducts with any of its
customers in order to obtain any such approval if it determines that such
limitation, curtailment or divestiture shall constitute or is
reasonably likely to cause a Material Adverse Effect on NCI.



Section 6.5  _Notification of Certain Matters._ RCC will give prompt notice
to NCI of (i) the existence or occurrence of each condition or state of facts
which to RCCs knowledge, will cause any representation or warranty of RCC or
the Company contained herein to be untrue or incorrect in any material
respect on the Closing Date and (ii) any material failure of RCC or the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by that Person hereunder as of the Closing Date.
NCI will give prompt notice to RCC of (i) the existence or occurrence of each
condition or state of facts which will or reasonably could be expected to
cause any representation or warranty of NCI contained herein to be untrue or
inaccurate on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any material failure of
NCI to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The delivery of any notice under
this Section will not be deemed to (i) modify the representations or
warranties herein of the party delivering that notice, or any other party,
(ii) modify the conditions set forth or referred to in Article 7 or (iii)
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving that notice.



Section 6.6 _Additional Financial Statements._ RCC will furnish to NCI as soon
as available and in any event within 45 days after the end of the Acquired
Businesss fiscal quarters which end prior to the Closing Date, an unaudited
balance sheet of the Acquired Business as of the end of that fiscal quarter
and the related statements of income or operations, cash flows
and stockholders or other owners equity for that fiscal quarter and for the
period of



 

\- 32 - the Acquired Business fiscal year ended with that quarter, in each case (i)
setting forth in comparative form the figures for the corresponding portion
of the Acquired Business previous fiscal year and (ii) prepared in accordance
with GAAP.



Section 6.7 _Indebtedness._ Prior to or at the Closing, the Company and RCC
shall ensure that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money. Prior to or at the Closing,
NCI will provide substitute letters of credit to obtain the return of letters
of credit supporting workers compensation obligations identified on Annex
4.15(d) (or substitutes therefor).



Section 6.8 _Public Announcements._ Prior to the Closing, each of NCI and RCC
will consult with and obtain the approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of the other party before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions it contemplates; provided, however, that no such consultation or
approval shall be required where the release or announcement is required by
applicable law; and provided, further, that either NCI or RCC may respond to
inquiries by the press or others regarding the transactions this Agreement
contemplates as long as such responses are consistent with and limited to the
partys previously issued press releases.



Section 6.9 _Further Assurances._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of NCI, RCC and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, including providing information and using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary exemptions, rulings,
consents, authorizations, approvals and waivers to effect all necessary
registrations and filings and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as
promptly as practicable.



Section 6.10 _Reorganization; No Elections under Section 338._ NCI, RCC and
the Company agree that the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization
Agreement qualify as tax-free reorganizations under Code Section 368(a)(1)(F)
and will be reported as such on the applicable Returns. As a result, for
income tax purposes, the Company will be treated as a continuation of RCC.
None of RCC, NCI or the Company, nor any of their Affiliates will make any
election under Code Section 338 with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. 



Section 6.11 _Tax Returns; Other Tax Matters._  



(a) RCC shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to file at their expense
all Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are required to be filed
(taking into account extensions of time to file) on or before the Closing
Date. NCI shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) at its
own expense all other Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries. If either
NCI or RCC may be liable for any material portion of the Tax payable in
connection with any Return to be filed by the other, the party responsible
under this Section for filing such Return (the "Preparer") shall prepare and
deliver to the other party (the "Payor") a copy of such Return and any
schedules, work papers and other documentation then available that are
relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return for which the Payor
is or may be liable hereunder not later than 30 days before the Due Date. The
Preparer shall not



 

\- 33 - file such Return until the earlier of either the receipt of written notice
from the Payor indicating the Payors consent thereto, or the Due Date. The
Payor shall have the option of providing to the Preparer, at any time at least
15 days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how the Payor wants
any, or all, of the items for which it may be liable reflected on such
Return. The Preparer shall, in preparing such Return, cause the items for
which the Payor is liable hereunder to be reflected in accordance with the
Payors instructions (unless, in the opinion of nationally recognized tax
counsel to the Preparer, complying with the Payors instructions would likely
subject the Preparer to any criminal penalty or to civil penalties under
Sections 6662 through 6664 of the Code or similar provisions of
applicable state, local or foreign laws) and, in the absence of having
received such instructions, in accordance with past practice.



(b) If the Preparer fails to satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section,
the Payor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Preparer for any Taxes
which are reflected on any such Return if and to the extent the Payor was
actually prejudiced by such failure, and shall retain any and all remedies it
may otherwise have which arise out of such failure.



(c) Each of RCC and NCI agrees to use its reasonable efforts to minimize the
amount of sales/use, excise, transfer (including real property excise,
transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar
Taxes payable in connection with the Contribution Agreement, the
Reorganization Agreement and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.



Section 6.12 _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements._ Any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements or arrangements, written or unwritten, binding
RCC or any Subsidiary of RCC, on the one hand, and the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date.

such prompt notice to the other party it shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit if and
to the extent that such other party is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice.



(b) _RCC s Items_. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or
portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Taxes for
which RCC is liable in full hereunder, RCC shall at its expense control the

only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for which the other
party is liable, the party which has the greater potential liability for
those Tax Items that cannot be so attributed or separated (or both) shall
control the defense of the Tax Audit, provided that such party defends the
items as reported on the relevant Return and _provided_ , _further_ that
no such matter shall be settled without the written consent of both parties,

Agreement, Company shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to RCC
the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest) resolved
or utilized by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. The Company

liability company existence of RCC will be maintained for a period of at least
six years following the Closing Date. Heico and RCC further agree that
aggregate distributions to shareholders of RCC during such period will not

(2) any nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of RCC in
this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or the Reorganization Agreement;



(3) (A) any Taxes imposed on the Company (including any Taxes attributable to
RCC as predecessor to the Company) or any Subsidiary of the Company with
respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the
Closing Date, to the extent such Taxes exceed the reserve for such Taxes on
the Companys Purchase Date Balance Sheet and (B) any transfer taxes for
which RCC is liable pursuant to Section 10.4 hereof;



(4) any Damage resulting from an Environmental Condition with respect to the
Assumed Assets; or



(5) exposure of any Person to asbestos or asbestos-containing materials or
products containing asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, in any case
marketed, manufactured, fabricated, constructed, sold, supplied, produced,
installed, maintained, serviced, or used at any time by RCC, the Acquired
Business, the Company or any of their predecessors or past or present
Subsidiaries or any other Entity for whose products or operations any of the
Entities referred to in this clause (iv) allegedly has liability or is
otherwise liable, and including any such Third Party Claim (1) for
compensatory damages (such as loss of consortium, wrongful death,
survivorship, proximate, consequential, general and special damages) and

(1) Any breach of the representations and warranties of NCI set forth in
Article 5;



(2) Any nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of NCI in this
Agreement; or



(3) Any Taxes imposed on the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company with
respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or after the
Closing Date.



Section 9.3 _Conditions of Indemnification._ (a) All claims for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as this
Section provides.



 

\- 40 - (b) An Indemnified Party claiming indemnification under this Agreement must
promptly (i) notify (x) RCC and Heico if a NCI Indemnified Party or (y) NCI
if a RCC Indemnified Party (the notified party or parties herein referred to
as the "Indemnifying Party") of any Third Party Claim asserted against
the Indemnified Party which could give rise to a right of indemnification
under this Agreement and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to that claim (if
any), an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to that claim to the
extent feasible (which estimate will not be conclusive of the final amount of
that claim) and the basis for the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement. Except as Section 9.1 sets forth, the
failure to promptly deliver a Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations to the Indemnified Party with respect to the related
Third Party Claim except to the extent that the resulting delay is prejudicial
to the defense of that claim. Within 15 days after receipt of any Claim Notice
(the "Election Period"), the Indemnifying Party must notify the Indemnified
Party whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against that Third Party
Claim.



(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its cost
and expense, that Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings the Indemnifying Party must prosecute diligently to a
final conclusion or settle at its discretion in accordance with this
paragraph (c), and the Indemnified Party will furnish the Indemnifying Party
with all information in its possession with respect to that Third Party Claim
and otherwise cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of that
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not
enter into any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim that purports
to limit the activities of, or otherwise restrict in any way, any Indemnified
Party or any Affiliate of any Indemnified Party without the prior consent of
that Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim the Indemnifying
Party controls under this paragraph (c) and will bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to that participation; provided, however, that if the
named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to it which are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party may employ separate
counsel (the expenses of which may be included in Damages), and, on its
written notification of that employment, the Indemnifying Party will not have
the right to assume or continue the defense of that action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will not enter into any settlement
with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior consent of the
Indemnifying Party.



(d) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
under Section 9.3(c) or fails to notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party under Section 9.3(c)
or (ii) elects to defend the Indemnified Party under Section 9.3(c), but
fails diligently to prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party will have the right to defend the Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings the Indemnified Party
must promptly and vigorously prosecute to a final conclusion or settle. The
Indemnified Party will have full



 

\- 41 - control of such defense and proceedings; however, the Indemnified Party will
not enter into any settlement with respect to a Third Party Claim without the
prior consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement the Indemnified
Party controls under this paragraph (d), and the Indemnifying Party will bear
its own costs and expenses with respect to that participation.



(e) Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnifying Party under this Article
9 relating to a Third Party Claim will be made within 30 days after the
latest of (i) the settlement of that Third Party Claim, (ii) the expiration of
the period for appeal of a final adjudication of that Third Party Claim or
(iii) the expiration of the period for appeal of a final adjudication of the
Indemnifying Partys liability to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement
in respect of that Third Party Claim.



(f) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes, or the
earnings and profits, of the Company or any Subsidiary the Company for a
portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date, the determination of the Taxes or the earnings and profits for
the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or
period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that
the taxable year or period ended on and included the Closing Date, except that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
and annual property taxes shall be prorated on the basis of the number of
days in the annual period elapsed through the Closing Date as compared to the
number of days in the annual period elapsing after the Closing Date.



(g) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, such liability shall be computed as if
such party or Subsidiary was not a member of RCCs consolidated, affiliated,
combined or unitary group for Tax purposes, on the one hand, or
NCIs consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group for Tax purposes,
on the other hand.



Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 9.2, RCC and Heico will not be required to indemnify or
hold harmless any of the NCI Indemnified Parties unless the liability of RCC
and Heico in respect of that NCI Indemnified Loss, when aggregated with the
liability of RCC and Heico in respect of the sum of all NCI Indemnified Losses
exceeds, and only to the extent the aggregate amount of all NCI Indemnified
Losses does exceed, the Threshold Amount.



(b) In no event will the aggregate liability of RCC under this Article 9
(other than under Section 9.2(a)(5) regarding asbestos matters) exceed
$50,000,000. In no event will the aggregate liability of Heico under this
Article 9 exceed $50,000,000.



Section 9.5 _Other Indemnification Provisions_.



(a) All indemnification payments under this Article 9 shall be deemed
adjustments to the Acquisition Consideration to the maximum extent permitted
by law, and the parties shall treat such payments as such for all Tax
purposes.



(b) The calculation of any Damage will reflect the amount of any unaffiliated
third party insurance proceeds received or to be received by an Indemnified
Party



 

\- 42 - in respect of such Damage within 12 months following any indemnification
payment. The calculation of any Damage will reflect the tax benefit, if any,
realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of the circumstances giving rise
to the liability for indemnification net of any tax due with respect to the
indemnification payment itself.



Section 9.6 _Remedies Exclusive_. After the Closing, indemnification under
this Article 9 will be the exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for any
breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement and for the matters
described in Section 9.2.



ARTICLE 10



GENERAL PROVISIONS



Section 10.1 _Treatment of Confidential Information_. (a) Each of RCC and
Heico acknowledges that it has or may have had in the past, currently has and
in the future may have access to Confidential Information of the Acquired
Business, the Company and NCI and its Affiliates. RCC agrees that it will keep
confidential all such Confidential Information and, except with the specific
prior written consent of NCI, will not disclose that Confidential Information
to any Person except (i) Representatives of NCI and (ii) its own
Representatives, provided that those Representatives agree to the
confidentiality provisions of this Section; provided, however, that, for
purpose of this paragraph (a), Confidential Information does not include such
information as (i) becomes known to the public generally through no fault of
RCC or Heico or (ii) is required to be disclosed by law or the order of any
Governmental Authority under color of law, provided, that prior to the
disclosure by RCC or Heico of any information under this clause (ii), RCC will
give prior written notice to NCI of the circumstances requiring disclosure
and provide NCI with the opportunity to contest that disclosure.



(b) Because of (i) the difficulty of measuring economic losses as a result of
the breach of the foregoing covenants in Section 10.1(a) and (ii) the
immediate and irreparable damage that would be caused to NCI for which it
would have no other adequate remedy, each of RCC and Heico agrees that, in the
event of a breach or threatened breach by RCC or Heico of the provisions of
this Section with respect to any Confidential Information, NCI will be
entitled to an injunction restraining RCC or Heico from disclosing, in whole
or in part, that Confidential Information. Nothing herein shall be
construed as prohibiting NCI from pursuing any other available remedy for
such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.



(c) The obligations of RCC and Heico under this Section will survive the
termination of this Agreement.



Section 10.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the rights of the parties hereunder may not be assigned (except by operation
of law and except that NCI may assign its rights hereunder to any Subsidiary
of NCI) and will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto.
Neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction Document is intended, or
shall be construed, deemed or interpreted, to confer on any Person not a party

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement. Except as Section 10.10 contemplates, this Agreement
may be amended, and any right hereunder may be waived, if, but only if, that
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by RCC and NCI. The waiver of
any of the terms and conditions hereof shall not be construed or interpreted
as, or deemed to be, a waiver of any other term or condition hereof.



Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as Article 9 may otherwise provide, regardless
of whether or not the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
are consummated, (i) NCI will pay the fees, expenses and disbursements of NCI
and its Representatives in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement; (ii) all sales/use, excise, transfer (including real property
excise, transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other
similar Taxes, incurred in connection with the Contribution Agreement, the
Reorganization Agreement and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be borne equally by RCC and NCI, and each party
shall file, to the extent required by applicable law, all necessary Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by
applicable law, shall cause its Affiliates to join the execution of any such
Returns or other documentation, and any Returns that must be filed in
connection with the Taxes described in this Section shall be prepared and
filed when due by such party; (iii) RCC will pay the fees, expenses and
disbursement of RCC and its Representatives in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement; and (iv) NCI shall pay all regulatory filing fees,
including fees required under the HSR Act incurred in connection with the

delivered or if delivered by telex, telegram, facsimile or courier service,
when actually received by the party to whom notice is sent or (ii) if

Date;

and warranties of RCC or the Company contained in this Agreement are or shall
become untrue (without giving affect to any materiality qualification or
standard contained in any such representations and warranties) in any respect
which untruth would give rise to the failure of the condition set forth

be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Acquired Business or RCC; provided

Agreement are or shall become untrue (without giving effect to any
materiality qualification or standard contained in any such representations
and warranties) which untruth would give rise to the failure of the condition

be true and correct, , individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of NCI to perform its obligations
hereunder; provided that the right of RCC to terminate this agreement pursuant
to this subsection (d) shall not be available unless such failure or untruth
is incapable of cure.

its covenants this Agreement sets forth. Nothing in this Article 11 will
release NCI or RCC from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
its termination.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the
