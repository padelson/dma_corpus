information and records) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall furnish Buyer with all such information and
data as Buyer may reasonably request (including copies of Contracts and such
other financial, operating and other data and information); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such accessing or furnishing of information shall be
conducted at Buyers expense, during normal business hours, under the
supervision of the Companys personnel and in such a manner as not to
interfere with the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
with the operation or use (including by the Companys customers) of the
Company Satellites or risk harm to them. All of such information shall be
treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference
hereby incorporated herein. Notwithstanding anything 

 



41  to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall be required to disclose any information to Buyer or its Representatives
if such disclosure would, in the opinion of outside counsel for the Company,
(i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) violate
any applicable Laws (including antitrust or competition Laws), fiduciary duty
or Contract entered into prior to the date hereof ( _provided_ that the
Sellers and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek the
consent of the counterparties to any Contracts prohibiting such disclosure).

retain the books and records relating to the Acquired Companies relating to

Sellers expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books
and records. 

Section 7.3 _Books and Records_. The Sellers shall at, or reasonably promptly
after, the Closing, provide to Buyer all of the books and records of the

7.3_. The Sellers shall keep such copies of the books and records of the
Acquired Companies confidential and shall not disclose them other that to its

the confidential nature of such documents and instructed to maintain such
documents confidential. The Seller will be responsible for any action taken by

this obligation. In the event that any of the Sellers, or its directors,
officers, employees, counsel or agents, is requested or required, in
connection with any proceedeng by or before a Governmental Authority to
disclose such copies of the books and records of the Acquired Companies, such
Seller shall give the Company and the Buyer prompt written notice of such
request or requirement so that the Company or Buyer may seek an appropriate
order or other remedy protecting such copies of the books and records of the
Acquired Companies, and such Seller will cooperate the Company and Buyer to
obtain such protective order or other remedy.

 

Section 7.4 _Update of Disclosure Schedules_. The Sellers, Dutchco, Mexico
Holdings and the Company shall have the right from time to time prior to the
Closing to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any
matter hereafter arising or events or conditions arising after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing. If the Sellers, Dutchco, Mexico Holdings or the
Company supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to this _Section
7.4_ and disclose an event, which occurrence or failure to occur makes it
impossible for the Sellers and the Company to satisfy the condition set
forth in _Section 8.3(a)_, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement by providing written notice of such termination to the Sellers and
the Company within ten (10) Business Days of Buyers receipt of the
updated Disclosure Schedules, with such termination being Buyers sole and
exclusive remedy relating to any matters set forth in the updated Disclosure
Schedules. If Buyer fails to provide written notice of such termination to the
Sellers and the Company within ten (10) Business Days of Buyers receipt of
the

 



42  updated Disclosure Schedules, then the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
to have been amended to include the updated matters, to have qualified the
representations and warranties in _Article III_ , _Article IV_ and _Article
V_ and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of representation or
warranty for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied. Nothing in this Agreement, including
this _Section 7.4_, shall imply that the Sellers, Dutchco, Mexico Holdings or
the Company is making any representation or warranty as of any date other than
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

(a) Each of the parties shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be

commitments or enter into any agreements that would be binding upon Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the Company, without the
prior written consent of Buyer and (B) neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to take any action that involves divestiture of
an existing business of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, after the
Closing, the Company, that involves unreasonable expense or that could
reasonably be expected to impair the overall benefit expected to be realized
from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Buyer shall bear the costs of all filing fees and other charges for filing
under applicable Laws by all parties. The Company hereby agrees (and agrees
to cause its Subsidiaries and their Representatives) to cooperate with Buyer
and its Representatives in providing all information and documents
attributable to the Sellers, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries or
relating to the business that are required under applicable Laws and to submit
requests for any consents, approvals, authorizations, opinions,
qualifications, orders and clearances required pursuant to applicable Laws.

 

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall submit to DDTC a

communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental

agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to matters
that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. Subject to _Section 7.2_, the parties will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods. Subject to _Section 7.2_, the parties will provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to any employee
of the Companys Subsidiaries under any plan, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Companys Subsidiaries to, (i) waive, to the extent such waiver may be
obtained in commercially reasonable terms, all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their covered
dependents under such plan (except to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under such Subsidiaries then
existing plans absent any change in such welfare coverage plan) and (ii)
provide each such employee and his or her covered dependents with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in coverage in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such
new or changed plan. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries
to, provide each employee of the Companys Subsidiaries with credit for all
service with the Companys Subsidiaries under each employee benefit plan,
policy, program or arrangement in which such employee is eligible to
participate, except to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of services.

(c) The parties agree that the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are not
intended to, and do not, limit any employee-related obligations of the
Companys Subsidiaries that arise under applicable Mexican Law.

Section 7.8 _Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) The Company shall purchase prior to the Closing Date and maintain in
effect beginning on the Closing and for a period of not less than six (6)
years thereafter without any lapses in coverage a "tail" policy providing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by any of the Acquired Companies directors and
officers liability insurance policies as of the date of this Agreement or as
of the Closing with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing;
_so long as_ the premium payable for such "tail" policy does not exceed of
two times in the aggregate of the annual premiums that would otherwise be
payable over such six (6) year period at the Companys current rates payable
for equivalent coverage. Such policy shall provide coverage that is at least
equal to the coverage provided under the Acquired Companies current
directors and officers liability insurance policies.

 



45 (b) Buyer covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that, after
the Closing, it shall not institute any Action against any of the current
directors of any of the Acquired Companies, in their capacity as such, with
respect to any liabilities, actions or causes of action, judgments, claims or
demands of any nature or description (consequential, compensatory, punitive
or otherwise), in each such case to the extent resulting from their approval
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of the persons who are
now, or have been at any time prior to the date hereof or who became prior to
the Closing Date, an officer or director of any of the Acquired Companies as
provided in the Acquired Companys governing documents and all indemnification
agreements between such persons and the applicable Acquired Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, unless terminated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing, shall
be assumed and performed by Buyer and shall continue in full force and effect
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or
omissions, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. No Acquired Company
shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify indemnification, liability limitation
or exculpation provisions of the Acquired Companies governing documents
after the Closing Date in any manner that could adversely affect the rights
thereunder of an individual who, as of the Closing Date or at any time prior
to the Closing Date, was a director, officer, employee or agent of any
Acquired Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law. To
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification,
liability limitation and exculpation shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, and the applicable Acquired Company shall advance expenses in
connection with such indemnification as provided in the governing documents or
other applicable agreements of such Acquired Company. If the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, the applicable Acquired Company shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of such
Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, assumes the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8_.

(d) The current and former directors, officers, employees and agents of each
Acquired Company entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 7.8_ are express, third-
party beneficiaries of this  _Section 7.8_. This _Section 7.8_ shall
survive the Closing and be binding on all successors and assigns of any
Acquired Company.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ are in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights to indemnification, liability limitation or exculpation
that any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of any of the
Acquired Companies may be entitled to or hereafter acquire under any Law,
agreement or provision of the governing documents of such Acquired Company.

 

Section 7.9 _Exclusivity_. The Acquired Companies and the Sellers shall
immediately cease any existing discussion or negotiation with any Persons
(other than Buyer and

 



46  its Representatives) conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any proposed, potential or contemplated acquisition of the capital
stock or assets and properties of the Company, Dutchco or Mexico Holdings
(any such transaction, a " _Potential Transaction_ "). The Acquired Companies
and the Sellers shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action
(x) to solicit or initiate the submission of any proposal or indication of
interest relating to a Potential Transaction with any Person (other than
Buyer), (y) to participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, a Potential
Transaction (or any proposal or indication of interest relating thereto) with
any Person (other than Buyer and its Representatives), or (z) to authorize,
engage in or enter into any agreement or understanding (other than
with Buyer) with respect to a Potential Transaction (or any proposal or
indication of interest relating thereto). Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall make demands to each Person (other than Buyer and
its Representatives) to whom information or documentation was provided in
connection with discussions or negotiations with respect to a Potential
Transaction to return or destroy all such information and documentation in
accordance with the terms of such Persons nondisclosure agreement with the
Company.

Section 7.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Withholding_. Buyer will notify the Sellers Representative in writing,
within a commercially reasonable time period of becoming aware of an
obligation under applicable Tax Law requiring Buyer to withhold Tax on the
Equity Purchase Price (including as a result of facts and circumstances other
than facts related to Buyer as described in _Section 6.1_), that Buyer
intends to withhold Tax on the Equity Purchase Price and Buyer will describe
such facts or Tax Law in such notice; and Buyer will be entitled to withhold
Tax on the Equity Purchase Price provided that Buyer has delivered such notice
to the Sellers Representative. If the Sellers Representative is so notified
in writing, Buyer and Sellers Representative will, in good faith, (i)
promptly attempt to resolve disputes (if any) regarding whether and the extent
to which withholding of any such Tax may be required and (ii) cooperate with
each other in order to minimize or eliminate any such potential withholding of
Tax (or obtain any applicable Tax refunds or credits). Subject to the first
two sentences of this  _Section 7.10(a)_, Buyer will be entitled to make any
withholding of Tax, to the extent required by applicable Tax Law, on the
Equity Purchase Price, and any amounts so withheld will be paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Tax Authority, and such amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
Sellers. Buyer shall furnish to the applicable Sellers official receipts (or
copies thereof) evidencing the payment of any such Taxes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer will make no withholding of any Tax on the Equity Purchase
Price (or will make an appropriate gross-up payment with respect to such
withholding so that the sum payable will be increased by the amount necessary
so that after making all required withholding, including withholding
applicable to additional sums payable under this gross-up payment, each Seller
shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
withholding been made) if such withholding would not be required but for (x)
a breach of the representations in _Sections 6.1_ or _6.10_ or (y) a failure
of Buyer to comply with the requirements of _Section 11.15_.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Buyer and its Affiliates (including after the Transactions,
the Acquired Companies), and Sellers shall provide each other with such
cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may request in
connection with any Tax matters relating to any of the

 



47  Acquired Companies, including as may be necessary to facilitate Tax
reporting by indirect shareholders during their ownership of such entities.
Such cooperation and information will include providing necessary financial
or Tax information or timely signing and delivering upon request such
certificates or forms that are necessary to establish an exemption from (or
otherwise reduce) Taxes, or an exemption from (or an extension in respect of)
an obligation to file Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this
_Section 7.10(c)_ will be kept confidential except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding. The costs of such cooperation and
information gathering shall be borne by the requesting party.

 

(c) _Election_. Buyer agrees that no election pursuant to Section 338 of the
Code (or any similar election under state or local Laws of any jurisdiction
within the United States) shall be made with respect to the Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries) or Mexico Holdings in connection with the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative. 

(d) _Tax Agreements._ Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall terminate
or cause to be terminated all Tax Agreements to which any of the Acquired
Companies is a party such that none of the Acquired Companies shall have any
obligations thereunder following the Closing.

(e) _Dutchco Tax Indemnity_. Dutch Coop shall indemnify and hold harmless
Dutchco from and against (A) any liability of Dutchco to make an actual
payment of Tax (a " _Tax Liability_ ") pursuant to article 39 of the Dutch
tax collection act ( _Invorderingswet 1990_ ), and (B) any liability for Tax
of Dutchco in respect of any period prior to the Closing Date during which
period Dutchco is subject to Tax on a stand-alone basis as a result of a
termination prior to the Closing Date of the Dutch fiscal unity ( _fiscale
eenheid_ ) in respect of Dutch Coop and Dutchco. The indemnity in this
_Section 7.10(e)_ shall not apply to a Tax Liability if and to the extent
that such Tax Liability arises (or is increased) as a consequence of any
failure by the Buyer to comply with any of its obligations under _Section
7.10(f)_.

 

(f) _Dutch Coop Fiscal Unity_. Without prejudice to the indemnity of _Section
7.10(e)(A)_, Dutch Coop and Buyer agree that the Dutch fiscal unity (
_fiscale eenheid_ ) in respect of Dutch Coop and Dutchco shall terminate on
the Closing Date. Buyer and its Affiliates (including after the Closing Date,
Dutchco) and Dutch Coop shall not take any position on a Tax Return or other
communication with any Tax Authority that is inconsistent with such agreed
termination date. Dutch Coop shall prepare a draft opening balance sheet of
Dutchco for Tax purposes as per the agreed termination date (the " _Opening
Balance Sheet_ "). Dutch Coop shall deliver the draft Opening Balance Sheet
to Buyer within thirty (30) Business Days after the Closing Date. The
acquisition price of the participation ( _kostprijs deelneming_ ) in the
Company and Mexico Holdings in the Opening Balance Sheet shall not be changed
from the acquisition price ( _kostprijs deelneming_ ) reported by Dutch Coop,
in its capacity as head of the fiscal unity, in the Tax Returns of the Dutch
fiscal unity ( _fiscale eenheid_ ) in respect of Dutch Coop and Dutchco,
unless otherwise required by Law. Buyer and its Affiliates (including after
the Closing Date, Dutchco), and any of their respective directors, employees,
agents or advisers, shall not amend the Opening Balance Sheet, except as
required by applicable Law.

(g) _Tax Allocation_. Buyer and its Affiliates (including after the Closing
Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Dutchco and Mexico Holdings) and each
Seller will not take

 



48  any inconsistent position on any Tax Return with respect to the allocation
to each Seller of the Equity Purchase Price as shown in _Schedule 2.2_ ,
unless (i) there is no reasonable basis for such allocation under Mexican Tax
Laws, or (ii) an inconsistent position is required pursuant to a final
determination under Mexican Tax Laws.

(h) _Tax Contest_.

(i) Following the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers
Representative in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of
any written notice by a Tax Authority of any Tax audit, examination or
assessment of the Company or its Subsidiaries, Dutchco or Mexico Holdings,
which could result in a Seller having an indemnification obligation under
Section 2.1(d) (" _Tax Matter_ "); provided, however, that no delay on the
part of Buyer in notifying the Sellers Representative will relieve any
Seller from any obligation under Section 2.1(d), except to the extent such
delay actually and materially prejudices such Seller.

(ii) Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall have the right, at their own
expense and with counsel of their choice, to jointly represent the interests
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Dutchco or Mexico Holdings in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to a Tax Matter, in
which case neither Buyer nor the Sellers Representative may settle or
compromise such Tax Matter without the prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the other party.
If the Sellers Representative does not notify Buyer of its election to
participate in such audit or proceeding within fifteen (15) days after
Buyer has given written notice of the Tax Matter to the Sellers
Representative, Buyer may defend the Tax Matter in any manner it may deem
appropriate; provided, however, that Buyer must reasonably defend the Tax
Matter in good faith.

 

(i) _Equity Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any indemnity paid under this
Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Equity
Purchase Price, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 7.11 _Fulfillment of Conditions_. The parties hereto will each use
their reasonable best efforts to take all steps necessary or desirable and
proceed diligently and in good faith to satisfy each condition to their
respective obligations contained in this Agreement. After the Closing each
party hereto will execute and deliver such further instruments and all
documents of conveyance and transfer of the Shares as any other party may
reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

the failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation or qualification as to "materiality" (including the word

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially delay
or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

to which this exception shall not apply) where the failure to be so true and
correct (without giving effect to any limitation or qualification as to

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Sellers, Dutchco, Mexico

their respective obligations and agreements and complied in all
material respects with all of their respective covenants and conditions
required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by them prior to

back on-line), which change is for any period of time under circumstances that
make it clearly ascertainable or predictable, based on satellite industry
engineering standards, that such change will result in the loss of transponder
capacity on such Company Satellite; _provided_ that any such event, condition
or circumstance disclosed in the Satellite Health Data provided to the Buyer
on or prior to the date of this Agreement shall not constitute an "Anomaly" to
the extent such disclosure has sufficient details to enable the Buyer to
determine the reasonably expected impact and consequences of the
event, condition or circumstance.

(ii) " _Satellite Material Adverse Change_ " means with respect to
any Company Satellite (other than the satellites known as Solidaridad 1,
Solidaridad 2 and Satmex 5), any change, circumstance, condition, event or

TERMINATION

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Sellers Representative;

(b) (i) by the Sellers Representative, if Buyer breaches or fails to perform
in any respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ and (B)
cannot be or has not been cured within 15 days following delivery of written
notice by the Sellers Representative of such breach or failure to perform
or (ii) by Buyer, if any Seller or any of the Company, Dutchco or Mexican
Holdings breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its respective
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such
breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _8.3_ and (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within 15 days following delivery of written notice by Buyer of
such breach or failure to perform;

 



52 (c) by the Sellers Representative or Buyer if the Closing shall not have
occurred by the date that is one hundred fifty (150) days after the Execution
Date (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the
conditions to the Closing (other than the condition set forth in  _Section
8.1(b)_ of this Agreement) have been satisfied or are capable of being
satisfied as of the Termination Date (or with respect to conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), then the Sellers
Representative or the Buyer may thereafter, in its sole and absolute
discretion, extend the Termination Date for up to a total of two (2)
additional periods of thirty (30) days each; _provided_ _further_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be
available if the failure of the party (in the case of the Sellers
Representative, including for this purpose the Company and each of the
Sellers) so requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on
or prior to such date.

 

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1_
(other than _Section 9.1(a)_) shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other parties.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become

Section 11.6 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, Article, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit such reference shall be to a
Section, Article, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement or in any Exhibit are for convenience of reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such
gender or number as the circumstances require. Any capitalized terms used
in any Schedule, Annex or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. All Exhibits annexed hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth herein. The word "including" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation",
unless otherwise specified and the phrase "in the ordinary course" or "in
the ordinary course of business" shall mean "in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice".

 

Section 11.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Annexes and Schedules hereto) constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior written agreements, arrangements, communications and
understandings and all prior and contemporaneous oral agreements,
arrangements, communications and understandings among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be deemed to contain
or imply any restriction, covenant, representation, warranty, agreement or
undertaking of any party with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
other than those expressly set forth herein, and none shall be deemed to
exist or be inferred with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Notwithstanding any oral agreement or course of action of the parties or their
Representatives to the contrary, no party to this Agreement shall be under
any legal obligation to enter into or complete the transactions contemplated
hereby unless and until this Agreement shall have been executed and delivered
by each of the parties.

 

Section 11.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,

Agreement, except as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_,  _Section 7.7_ and
_Section 7.8_.

 



57 Section 11.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly
agreed that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 9.1_, each party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement by any other party and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
party, and appropriate injunctive relief shall be granted in connection
therewith. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of specific
performance or other equitable remedy shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be
in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. 

Section 11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to any principles of conflicts of

or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or if the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other
state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and any appellate
court therefrom) and each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such
suit, action or proceeding. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably waives,
with respect to any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any objection which
it may have at any time to the laying of venue in the courts identified in
this _Section 11.11_, (b) any claim that any of the courts identified in this
_Section 11.11_ is an inconvenient forum, (c) the right to object that any
court identified in this _Section 11.11_ does not have personal jurisdiction
over such party and (d) any claim that any of the courts identified in this
_Section 11.11_ lack jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such suit,
action or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any
such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being
served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the
delivery of a copy thereof (other than by facsimile) in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 11.5_.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT

 



58  WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH

EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS

WITHOUT A JURY. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE COMPANY,

CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE COMPANY, THE SELLERS AND THE
SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY
PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS  _SECTION
11.12_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO
THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 11.13 _Disclosure Generally_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement, the information
and disclosures contained in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Disclosure Schedule as
though fully set forth in such Disclosure Schedule for which applicability of
such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule shall not
be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall
not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

Section 11.14 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,

be necessary to issue new share certificates as a result of an increase of
the corporate capital for capitalization of premiums on shares, capitalization
