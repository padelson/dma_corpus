Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable) and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. No Party shall oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to raise as a defense that an adequate remedy at law exists or that specific performance or equitable or injunctive relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason with respect to any breach of this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby waives: (a)&nbsp;any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy
at law would be adequate; and (b)&nbsp;any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The Parties further agree that by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section&nbsp;12.16,
(i) a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
