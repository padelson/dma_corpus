in reasonable detail Parents calculation, of: (i) the Closing Date Net
Working Capital; (ii) the Working Capital Increase or Working Capital
Decrease, as the case may be; (iii) the amount of the Closing Date Cash; and
(iv) the resulting calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration. Together
with the Closing Date Statement, Parent shall provide the Member
Representative with reasonable supporting documentation of such calculation.

 

(c) _Disputes_.

 

(i) If the Member Representative objects to Parents calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Increase or the Working
Capital Decrease, as the case may be, the amount of the Closing Date Cash, or
the resulting calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration as set forth in
the Closing Date Statement, then, within fifteen (15) days after the delivery
to the Member Representative of the Closing Date Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "), the Member Representative shall deliver to Parent a written notice
(a " _Dispute Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the Member
Representatives objections to Parents calculation of the amounts set forth
in such Closing Date Statement and containing a statement setting forth the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Increase
or Working Capital Decrease, as the case may be, the amount of the Closing
Date Cash, and the resulting calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration,
in each case determined by the Member Representative to be correct. If the
Member Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Parent during the
Review Period, then Parents calculation of the amounts set forth in the
Closing Date Statement shall be binding and conclusive on the Parties.

 

(ii) If the Member Representative delivers a Dispute Notice, and if Parent
and the Member Representative are unable to agree upon the calculation of the
amounts set forth in the Closing Date Statement within thirty (30) days after
such Dispute Notice is delivered to Parent, then the Member Representative and
Parent shall jointly engage the firm of Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Arbitration
Firm_ ") to resolve such dispute. Within ten (10) days after the Arbitration
Firm is appointed, Parent shall forward a copy of the Closing Date Statement
to the Arbitration Firm, and the Member Representative shall forward a copy
of the Dispute Notice to the Arbitration Firm, together with, in each case,
all relevant supporting documentation. The Arbitration Firms role shall be
limited to resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations
to be used on only the disputed portions of the Closing Date Statement
(including any dispute with respect to the timeliness of delivery or receipt
of any Dispute Notice), and the Arbitration Firm shall not make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether any other items on
the Closing Date Statement are correct or whether the Target Net Working
Capital is correct. The Arbitration Firm shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by the Member
Representative or Parent or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by the Member Representative or Parent and shall be limited to the selection
of either the Member Representatives or Parents position on a disputed item
(or a position in between the positions of the Member Representative or
Parent) based solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the
Parties and not pursuant to any independent review. In resolving such
objections, the Arbitration Firm shall apply the provisions of this Agreement
concerning determination of the amounts set forth in the Closing Date
Statement. The Arbitration Firm shall deliver to the Member Representative
and Parent a written determination (such determination to include a work sheet
setting forth all material calculations

 



-18-  used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Arbitration Firm by the Member Representative and Parent) of
the disputed items submitted to the Arbitration Firm within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of such disputed items. The determination by the
Arbitration Firm of the disputed amounts and the Adjusted Merger Consideration
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error. The
fees and expenses of the Arbitration Firm for such determination shall be
borne by the Member Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand, in inverse proportion to the manner in which such Person prevails
on the items resolved by the Arbitration Firm, which proportionate allocation
shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values
of the amounts in dispute and shall be computed by the Arbitration Firm at the
time its determination of the items in dispute is rendered. For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Arbitration Firm
awards $600 in favor of the Member Representatives position, 60% of the costs
and expenses of the Arbitration Firm would be borne by Parent and 40% would
be borne by the Member Representative. The Adjusted Merger Consideration, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.8(c), shall be referred to
herein as the " _Final Merger Consideration_ ".

(d) _Payment of Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration (such excess, a " _Merger Consideration Increase_ "), then (A)
Parent shall, within two (2) Business Days following the final determination
of the Final Merger Consideration, pay to each Company Member an amount equal
to such Company Members applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
Increase, in accordance with the Payment Spreadsheet, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account (or accounts) designated by such
Company Member in writing prior to such payment date (including in such
Company Members Letter of Transmittal), and (B) Parent and the Member
Representative shall, within two (2) Business Days following the final
determination of the Final Merger Consideration, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
Working Capital Escrow Subaccount to the Company Members in an amount equal to
each Company Members Pro Rata Share. If the Final Merger Consideration equals
the Estimated Merger Consideration, Parent and the Member Representative
shall, within two (2) Business Days following the final determination of the
Final Merger Consideration, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Working Capital Escrow
Subaccount to the Company Members in an amount equal to each Company Members
Pro Rata Share.

 

(ii) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration (such excess, a " _Merger Consideration Decrease_ "), then
Parent and the Member Representative shall, within two (2) Business Days
following the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration, deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release from the Working Capital Escrow Subaccount an amount equal to the
lesser of (A) the Merger Consideration Decrease, or (B) the amount in the
Working Capital Escrow Subaccount to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account (or accounts) designated by Parent in such joint
written instructions, and shall release the remaining balance of the Working
Capital Escrow Subaccount, if any, to the Company Members in an amount equal
to each Company Members Pro Rata Share.

 



-19- (iii) Parent agrees that the adjustments to the Estimated
Merger Consideration and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in
Section 2.8(c) shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed
herein, and that the Working Capital Escrow Subaccount shall be Parents sole
recourse with respect to, and the exclusive source of funds for, payment of
the Merger Consideration Decrease (if any) required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.8(d)(ii).

 

(e) _Cooperation_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in
Sections 2.8(c) and 2.8(d), each of Parent and the Member Representative
shall cooperate with each other and make available to the other Party, the
other Partys representatives and the Arbitration Firm all information,
records, data and working papers, and shall permit reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon the giving of reasonable notice to its
facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Closing Date Statement and the resolution of
any disputes thereunder.

2.9 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) Prior to, or promptly following, the Closing, the Company or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall deliver to each Company Member a
letter of transmittal, in substantially the form of _Exhibit F_ attached
hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall: (i) contain
instructions for surrendering such Company Members Certificates, if any, and
delivering the Letter of Transmittal, and receiving such Company Members
applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration (as provided in Section
2.9(b)); (ii) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to such Company Units shall pass, upon proper delivery to Parent of such
Company Members Certificates, if any, and duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal; (iii) contain a general release of claims against
Parent and the Company; (iv) contain an agreement to be bound by the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Agreement; and (v)
contain such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
upon.

 

(b) With respect to any duly completed and validly executed Letters of
Transmittal and Certificates, if any, surrendered by a Company Member to
Parent after the Effective Time, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, pay
to such Company Member such Company Members applicable portion of the Net
Closing Merger Consideration or, if then determined, the Final Merger
Consideration, in accordance with this Agreement and the Payment Spreadsheet,
without interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts specified in the Letter of Transmittal. For the avoidance
of doubt, upon the surrender of such Letters of Transmittal and Certificates,
if any, each Company Member shall also be entitled (to the extent not already
paid) to the following amounts that may be payable in the future in respect of
the Company Units formerly represented by such Certificates: (i) amounts due
on account of any Merger Consideration Increase as provided in Section
2.8(d)(i), (ii) any release of funds from the Escrow Account as provided in
Section 9.8 and the Escrow Agreement, and (iii) any release of funds from the
Member Representative Reimbursement Fund as provided in Section 12.17(c), in
each case, at the respective time and subject to the terms specified herein
and therein.

 



-20- (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Company Units are registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that: (i) the Certificate evidencing such Company Units, if any, shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer; (ii)
the Letter of Transmittal delivered to Parent shall be duly completed and
validly executed and otherwise in proper form; and (iii) the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the Company Member in whose name the Company Units are registered,
or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of Company Units
on the transfer books of the Surviving Entity. If, after the Effective Time,
a Certificate is presented to Parent or the Surviving Entity, such Certificate
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration as provided in Section
2.6.

 

(e) Any portion of the Final Merger Consideration that remains
undistributed immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity will be liable to
any Company Member for any part of the Final Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

2.10 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Article 2, if, during the Interim Period, any change in the outstanding
Company Units shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split or combination of Company Units, any exchange or readjustment of Company
Units or any similar transaction, or any dividend of Equity Interests on the
Company Units shall be effected, the consideration payable to the Company
Members in respect of their Company Units set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet
will be appropriately adjusted to reflect any such change. 

2.11 _Dissenting Units_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Company
Units that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by Company Members properly exercising dissenters rights
available under the Dissenters Act (the " _Dissenting Units_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Entity with
respect thereto and shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive cash or other consideration therefor unless and until such
holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal under the Dissenters Act. Dissenting Units
shall be treated in accordance with the Dissenters Act. If any holder of
Dissenting Units shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Company Units shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, such holders applicable portion of
the Final Merger Consideration, without interest, in respect of such Company
Units in accordance with Section 2.6(b).

 



-21- (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give to Parent (i)
prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal rights with respect to any
Company Units, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the Dissenters Act and received by the Company relating to
appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in the conduct of
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal rights.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, prior to the Closing, and the
Member Representative, after the Closing (in each case, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by Parent and/or the Member
Representative, as applicable), the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal rights or settle any such demands for
appraisal rights.

2.12 _Purchase Price Allocation_. ____

 

(a) The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that pursuant to Revenue
Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2), the Merger hereunder will be
treated for federal income Tax purposes by Parent as a purchase of the assets
of the Company, and by the Company Members as a sale of their respective
Company Units. For purposes of Section 751 of the Code and the statement
required to be filed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.751-1(a)(3) and for
purposes of the purchase of undivided interests in the assets of the Company
pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, and Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, each as the case may be, the Parties
agree that the Final Merger Consideration, as adjusted, and the Liabilities of
the Company (plus other relevant and required items), will be allocated to the
underlying assets of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. As soon as
practicable after the Closing, and in any event, within one hundred twenty
(120) days of the Closing Date, Parent shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.12(b), provide to the Member Representative a draft of such
allocation (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") which Allocation Schedule shall
reflect any adjustments to the Final Merger Consideration. The Parties shall
file all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594 (with respect to Parent), in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule and the tax treatment described
in this Section 2.12, and no Party shall take any position in any Tax Return
that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, as adjusted, unless
required to do so by a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code. The Parties agree to promptly advise each other regarding the existence
of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial Tax proceeding related to the
tax treatment of the Merger or the Allocation Schedule. Not later than thirty
(30) days prior to the filing of Parents Form 8594 relating to
this transaction, Parent shall deliver to the Member Representative a copy of
its Form 8594.

(b) Parent shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) a draft of the
Allocation Schedule (and any adjustments thereto) to the Member Representative
pursuant to Section 2.12(a) for the Member Representatives review and
comment, and shall consider all such comments in good faith. If within thirty
(30) days after the Member Representatives receipt of the draft Allocation
Schedule, the Member Representative has not objected in writing to such draft
Allocation Schedule, then such draft Allocation Schedule shall become the
final Allocation Schedule (as it may be subject to adjustment from time to
time pursuant to Section 2.12(a)). In the event the Member Representative
objects in writing within such 30-day period, Parent shall consider such
objections in good faith and shall negotiate with the Member

 



-22-  Representative in good faith to resolve any outstanding disagreements. If
the Parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after the
date of the Member Representatives notice of objection, then (i) such
dispute shall be resolved, and (ii) the final Allocation Schedule (as it may
be subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to Section 2.12(a)) shall
be determined by the Arbitration Firm. The final Allocation Schedule (as it
may be subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to Section 2.12(a)),
as agreed upon by the Member Representative and Parent or otherwise determined
pursuant to this Section 2.12(b), shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. Each of the Member Representative and Parent shall bear all of their
own respective fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
determination of the final Allocation Schedule (as it may be subject
to adjustment from time to time pursuant to Section 2.12(a)), except the
Member Representative and Parent (collectively) shall each pay one-half (50%)
of the fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitration Firm, if any.

2.13 _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity
and the Member Representative shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amount paid or payable in connection with the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Entity and the Member Representative are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
duly and timely deposited with the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. No later than five (5) days before the Closing,
Parent shall notify the Member Representative if it believes any such
withholding will be required from any payments in respect of Company Units
(including Dissenting Units) and, if Parent believes such withholding is
required, Parent shall cooperate in good faith with the Member Representative
to reduce the amount of, or eliminate the necessity for, such withholding.

party thereto, constitutes, or will constitute, a valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in

4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_.

Sub is required to give any material notice to, make any material filing
with, or obtain any material authorization, consent, or approval of any
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements to which either of them is a party or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(b) Assuming the Parent Required Governmental Approvals are given, made or
obtained, as the case may be, the execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
either of them is a party, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, does not: (i) violate or conflict with any

limited liability company agreement or other governing documents of Parent or
Merger Sub; (ii) violate any Law or Order to which Parent or Merger Sub is

unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving

to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due. No transfer of property is being made
by Parent or Merger Sub and no obligation is being incurred by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

set forth in Article 3 (including the Disclosure Schedules), it is relying on
its own investigation and analysis in entering into this Agreement and
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is an informed and sophisticated participant in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and has undertaken such investigation, and
has been provided with and has evaluated such information, as it has deemed
necessary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, except for the

(including the Disclosure Schedules), none of the Company, its Subsidiary, any
of their respective managers, directors, officers, employees, members,
stockholders, Affiliates agents or representatives, or any other Person, has
made or shall be deemed to have made any representation or warranty to Parent
or Merger Sub, express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiary or the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub hereby disclaims any reliance upon any such representations and
warranties. Nothing in this Section 4.7 shall impact any rights of any Party
to this Agreement in respect of Fraud.

efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, including taking all actions necessary to comply
promptly with all applicable Laws that may be imposed on it or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the Closing.

of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, any and all
consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities or other
Persons required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each Party shall cooperate with the other Parties to this
Agreement in obtaining all such consents, approvals and authorizations;
_provided_ , _however_ , that except as otherwise provided in the second
sentence of Section 5.5(b), neither Parent nor the Company shall be required
to expend any funds to obtain any consents, approvals or authorizations of
Governmental Authorities or other Persons. 

(c) _Notice of Adverse Developments_. During the Interim Period, Parent
and Merger Sub, on one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall give
prompt written notice to the other of the discovery by such Party of any fact,
event or action the occurrence of which would make satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Article 7 impossible or unlikely. Subject to Section
5.7 (Schedule Supplements), no notice given pursuant to this Section 5.2(c)
shall have any curative effect on the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of
indemnification or termination rights or for determining satisfaction of any
condition contained herein.

 

(d) _Further Assurances_. If any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each Party, upon request of the
other Party and from time to time, will take such further action (including

other Party may reasonably request and deem necessary or desirable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, all at the sole
cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant to Article 9).

 

5.3 _Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge that the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements (including
all drafts thereof) and the information being exchanged in connection with the
transactions described herein are subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the

effective upon, the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause the
Confidentiality Agreement to be terminated.

authorized representatives reasonable access, during regular business hours,
to the executive personnel, offices, properties, Contracts, books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall furnish Parent all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request in
order for Parent to have the opportunity to make such investigation as it
shall reasonably desire to make of the affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Parent acknowledges and agrees that all information it obtains
as a result of access under this Section 5.4 shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



-43- 5.5 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of Section 5.2(b),
each of the Parties shall promptly execute and file, or join in the execution
and filing of, any application, notification, or other document that may be
necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval, or consent of any
Governmental Authority that may be reasonably required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain (and, in the case of the Company, cause its Subsidiaries to obtain) all
such authorizations, approvals, and consents as promptly as possible after the
execution of this Agreement, including the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the foregoing, to the extent not
completed prior to the date hereof, the Parties shall make, or cause to be
made, all filings required of each of them or any of their respective
Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within five (5) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, and Parent shall pay all filing fees,
application fees or other fees of the applicable Governmental Authority
associated with the HSR Act filing and any filings under other Antitrust Laws.
Each of the Parties shall (i) seek early termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, and (ii) furnish promptly to the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") and any other requesting
Governmental Authority any additional information reasonably requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws in connection with such
filings. The Parties will notify each other promptly of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made pursuant to this
Section 5.5(b). Each of the Parties shall cooperate reasonably with the other
Parties in connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing
Parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any
other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any
such filing. No Party hereto shall independently participate in any formal
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Parties prior notice
of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate. To the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, and subject to all applicable privileges (including the
attorney-client privilege), each of the Parties shall consult and cooperate
with the other Parties, and consider in good faith the views of each other, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
Party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws. Each of the Parties may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other Parties under this Section 5.5(b) as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, managers, or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials.

 



-44- (c) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction
(including any merger or acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to
make it materially more difficult, or to materially increase the time
required, to: (i) obtain the expiration and termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other Order that would materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii)
obtain all authorizations, approvals and consents of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.6 _Member Approval_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall, in accordance
with the RULLCA, the Articles and the Operating Agreement, use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek and obtain written consents from all Company
Members who have not previously executed such written consents, and deliver
copies of such written consents to Parent. The Company or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable under the Dissenters Act, shall comply with all notice
requirements under the Dissenters Act.

5.7 _Schedule Supplements_. The Company may, from time to time prior to
the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
supplement or amend any Schedule in order to add information relating to or
resulting from facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this
Agreement (a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). In the event that the Company
provides any Schedule Supplement, the matters set forth on such Schedule
Supplement shall not be effective to cure and correct any breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant, which would have existed if the
Company had not provided such Schedule Supplement, including for purposes of
indemnification or termination rights or for determining satisfaction of any
condition contained herein. In the event that, prior to the Closing, the
Company provides to Parent a Schedule Supplement pursuant to the terms of this
Section 5.7 due to facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of
this Agreement that, but for this Section 5.7, would entitle Parent to not
consummate the Closing (a " _Significant Schedule Supplement_ "), Parent may
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1 within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of such Significant Schedule Supplement. If Parent
proceeds to consummate the Closing after receiving a Significant Schedule
Supplement, Parent shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights, remedies
or other recourse to which Parent might otherwise be entitled in respect of a
breach that would be cured by such Significant Schedule Supplement, including
any rights or remedies under Article 9, and such Significant Schedule
Supplement shall be effective to cure and correct for all other purposes any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed if
the Company had not provided such Significant Schedule Supplement, and all
references to any Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended by
such Significant Schedule Supplement shall for all purposes after the Closing
be deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as so supplemented or amended.

 



-45- 5.8 _Cuater_ _Acquisition_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause Cuater
to, consummate the transactions contemplated by the Cuater Asset Purchase
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. Upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Cuater Asset Purchase Agreement, all
references to the "Company" herein shall be deemed to give effect to such
transactions and the Companys ownership of the assets of Cuater thereunder.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
Section 5.1, the Company shall not, and shall cause Cuater not to (i) agree
to or effect any amendment or modification to, or any waiver under, or any
termination of the Cuater Asset Purchase Agreement, including with regards to
(A) expanding the conditions precedent to, or otherwise taking any actions
reasonably expected to delay or hinder, the closing thereunder, (B) imposing
any additional liability on, or otherwise expanding the obligations of, the
Company thereunder, (C) increasing the amount, or modifying the form, of
consideration to be paid by the Company thereunder or (D) otherwise modifying
the Cuater Asset Purchase Agreement in any respect, or (ii) assign any of
their respective rights or obligations under the Cuater Asset Purchase
Agreement or any agreement, document or instrument contemplated thereby or
executed in connection therewith, in each case without the prior written
consent of Parent.

 

5.9 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. During the Interim Period, the
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any Person acting on its
behalf or otherwise, initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information or assistance) or enter into discussions or
negotiations of any type, directly or indirectly, or enter into
a confidentiality agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement with
any Person other than Parent with respect to a sale of all or any substantial
portion of the Business or its assets, or a merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale of all or any substantial portion of the Equity Interests
of the Company, or the liquidation or similar extraordinary transaction with
respect to the Company. The Company hereby acknowledges that as of the date
hereof it is not engaged in ongoing discussions or negotiations with any
party other than Parent with respect to any of the foregoing. The Company
agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party. The
Company will immediately notify Parent (orally and in writing) if any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated, any inquiry or
proposal is made, or any information is requested with respect to any of the
foregoing, with such notification including the identity of the third party
with whom such discussions or negotiations are sought and the terms of any
such inquiry or proposal received in respect of the foregoing.

ARTICLE 8

GENERAL COVENANTS

8.1 _Books and Records; Access_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to possession of all
books and records (including documents, agreements, and financial data)
relating to the Business and/or the Company and its Subsidiaries. Solely in
order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or incurred by
(a) the Company prior to the Closing or (b) the Company Members pursuant to
this Agreement, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Member Representative and its
representatives with reasonable access to and/or copies of such books and
records (solely to the extent related to a period prior to the Closing
Date) during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, which
notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity the purpose for which the
Member Representative requests such access. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Member Representative, Parent shall not, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries not to, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the
books and records relating to the Business, the Company or its Subsidiaries,
for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior
written notice to the Member Representative and offering to surrender to the
Member Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.
Parent shall not be obligated to provide any Person with access to any books
or records pursuant to this Section 8.1 where such access would violate any
Law.

8.2 _Post-Closing Employment_.

 

(a) During the twelve (12)-month period following the Effective Time,
Parent shall take, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
to take, all actions required so

 



-50-  that all individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue their
employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (the " _Post-Transaction Employees_"; _provided_
that the term Post-Transaction Employees shall not include the employees
identified on Schedule 7.2(e)): (i) receive base compensation and target
bonus and commission opportunities (which shall not include any special, one-
time cash incentive opportunities, such as retention bonuses) that are
no less favorable than that provided immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) receive employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than long-term equity incentive compensation); and
(iii) to the extent that any such employees are terminated other than for
"cause" following the Effective Time, receive severance pay and benefits that
are no less than the severance pay and benefits that would have been payable
under the severance plan, policy or practice in effect immediately prior to
the date of this Agreement had such employee been terminated other than for
"cause" immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries to honor all employment, severance and consulting
agreements to which the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the Post-Transaction Employees.

 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Post-Transaction
Employees to receive service credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes where length of
service is relevant under any employee benefit plans and arrangements
in which such Post-Transaction Employees may be eligible to participate
following the Effective Time, except to the extent such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent that Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries modifies any coverage or benefit plans
under which the Post-Transaction Employees participate, Parent, the Surviving
Entity or the applicable Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-
existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such
employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans or agreements for
deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been
paid during the year in which such coverage or plan modification occurs.
Parent shall be solely responsible for any obligations arising under Section
4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9).

(d) For a period of ninety (90) days following the Effective Time, to the
extent applicable, Parent shall comply, and shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries to comply, with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN Act_ "), or any similar
state or local Law; _provided_ that Parent expressly assumes all Liabilities
and responsibility for any Losses attributable to any failure by Parent or the
Surviving Entity at or following the Closing to comply with the WARN Act or
any similar state or local Law.

(e) If requested by Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan effective at least one (1) day prior to
the Closing Date. In

 



-51-  connection with such termination, the Company and Parent agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) amend their respective 401(k) plans to
the extent necessary or required by applicable Law to facilitate the
distribution and rollover of the Post-Transaction Employees 401(k) plan
account balances to a 401(k) plan sponsored by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) take any additional action reasonably required to
permit each Post-Transaction Employee who has received an eligible rollover
distribution to roll such eligible rollover distribution into a 401(k) plan
sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time.

(f) This Section 8.2 shall survive the Effective Time and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall: (i) be construed as an
amendment or other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) create any
right in any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any continued employment or service with the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates; (iii) give any third party any right or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 8.2,
including any right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement; or (iv)
prohibit Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary from terminating any
Employee Benefit Plan or other agreement or arrangement in accordance with
the terms of such Employee Benefit Plan, agreement or arrangement.

 

8.3 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, indemnify and
hold harmless all current and former directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO
Indemnified Persons_") against any Losses incurred in connection with any
Action, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby), in each case in their capacities as such whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be,
would have been permitted, under applicable Law, indemnification agreements
existing on the date hereof or the governing documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof, to indemnify such DandO Indemnified
Persons. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
not, and shall cause the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries not to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision of any indemnification agreements
existing on the date hereof or any provision in the Surviving Entitys or any
of its Subsidiaries governing documents relating to the indemnification of
the DandO Indemnified Persons, in each case in a manner that would limit the
scope of such indemnification.

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance
policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a
claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with an A++ or AAA credit rating with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at

 



-52-  or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Entity be required to expend an annual premium
for such coverage in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the last
annual premium paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for such
insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or
less than the Maximum Premium, Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable,
shall obtain that amount of directors and officers insurance (or "tail"
coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries
not to, cancel or change the terms of such insurance policies in any respect
if doing so would have an adverse effect upon the DandO Indemnified Persons.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or assigns: (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Entity or
entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this Section 8.3.

(d) The provisions of this Section 8.3 are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
had, under applicable Law, by Contract or otherwise.

8.4 _Public Announcements_. No press release or public announcement
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or, prior
to the Effective Time, any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, lessors, lessees, licensors or
licensees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made
by any Party hereto without the joint written approval of Parent and the
Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required by: (a) applicable Law; (b) the rules and
regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement of, a stock exchange or trading
system; (c) Order of a Governmental Authority; or (d) subpoena, summons or
legal process; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each such case, Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review such press release, announcement or
communication prior to issuance, distribution or publication.

 

8.5 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers,
directors and managers of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

(Organization; Good Standing); Section 3.2 (Capitalization); Section 3.3
(Power and Authority); Section 3.5 (Brokers Fees); Section 4.1 (Organization;

harmless and defend Parent and its Affiliates (which, following the Closing,

accountants and other agents (each, a " _Parent_ _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Parent_ _Indemnitees_ ") against and in respect of any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Parent Indemnitee that result from
or arise out of:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Article 3 of this Agreement, in each
case as of the date of this Agreement, the Closing Date, and any specific date
set forth in such representation or warranty;

 

(b) any breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement on the part of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under this Agreement (for the avoidance of
doubt, other than (i) any breach by the Surviving Entity of any covenant,
obligation or agreement of the Surviving Entity under this Agreement following
the Effective Time, and/or (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

(d) any claim by any holder or former holder of Company Units or other

expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in respect of such holders
exercise; or

(e) any Transaction Expenses not paid at the Closing.

 



-54- 9.3 _Limitations_.

 

(a) The indemnification provided in Section 9.2 and Section 9.4 is subject
to the following limitations:

 

(i) No demand for indemnification under Section 9.2 or Section 9.4 shall be
made after the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
Section 9.1 for the representation or warranty or covenant to which such
demand relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that demands for indemnification made
prior to the expiration of such period shall survive until such claim for
indemnification is finally adjudicated and resolved.

(ii) The Company Members shall not have any obligation to indemnify the
Parent Indemnitees in respect of any Losses for which indemnification is
claimed under Section 9.2(a) (other than for claims in respect of Fraud), and
Parent shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Member Indemnitees in
respect of any Losses for which indemnification is claimed under Section
9.4(a) (other than for claims in respect of Fraud): (A) if the Losses
associated with any individual claim are less than $10,000 (the " _ _De__ _
_Minimis__ _Claim Amount_ "), it being understood that any such individual
claim for amounts less than the _De_ _Minimis_ Claim Amount shall be included
in determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter; and
(B) unless and until the aggregate of such Losses exceeds $627,500 (the "
_Deductible_ "), at which point the Company Members (subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.3(a)(iii) and Section 9.3(a)(iv)) or
Parent, as applicable, will be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees
or Member Indemnitees, as applicable, from and against all such Losses in
excess of the Deductible.

 

(iii) Claims for indemnification under Section 9.2(a) shall be subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 9.3(a)(ii) with respect to the _De_
_Minimis_ Claim Amount and the Deductible (other than claims in respect of
Fraud), and, once the Deductible has been met, such claims for indemnification
shall be satisfied: (A) first, from the then-remaining amounts in the
Indemnity Escrow Subaccount; (B) second, from the RandW Insurance Policy subject
to the retention and policy limits thereof; and (C) thereafter, and solely for
claims in respect of any Fundamental Representation or Fraud, by the Company
Members, severally and not jointly; _provided_ , _however,_ that the several
liability of each Company Member under this Section 9.3(a)(iii) shall be
determined based on the amount by which the portion of the aggregate amount
of the Final Merger Consideration payable to each such Company Member in the
Merger would have been reduced had the aggregate liability of the Company
Members under this Section 9.3(a)(iii) been treated as a reduction to the
aggregate amount of the Final Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company Members shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Parent
Indemnitees in respect of any Losses for which indemnification is claimed
under Section 9.2(a) with respect to Fundamental Representations unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses for which indemnification is incurred or
suffered by any Parent Indemnitees under Section 9.2(a) exceeds $21,255,000. 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (A) the
maximum amount that the Parent Indemnitees may recover from any Company
Member pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (other than for claims in respect of any
Fundamental Representation or Fraud) shall be limited to such Company Members
Pro Rata Share of the Indemnity Escrow 

 



-55-  Amount; and (B) the maximum amount that the Parent Indemnitees may recover
from any Company Member under this Article 9 (including, without limitation,
Section 9.2(a) (for claims in respect of any Fundamental Representation or
Fraud)) shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the Final Merger
Consideration received by such Company Member; _provided_ , _however_ , that
to the extent there are any Unfunded Indemnity Obligations, such maximum
amount with respect to a Company Member shall be increased to include such
Company Members pro rata share of the aggregate amount of any Unfunded
Indemnity Obligations (which pro rata share shall be determined
without taking into account the Company Units held by the Company Members who
have not executed a Support Agreement and/or Letter of Transmittal);
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither this limitation nor any limitation set
forth in this Article 9 shall restrict Parents rights under the RandW
Insurance Policy. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Parent shall be
liable under this Article 9 shall not exceed the Final Merger Consideration.

 

(v) No Company Member shall be liable under this Article 9: (A) for any
Losses relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in the
Financial Statements a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter,
or (B) for any duplication of amounts taken into account in the determination
of the Estimated Merger Consideration or the Final Merger Consideration, each
in accordance with Section 2.8.

(vi) The amount of Losses that any Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover shall be calculated net of any Tax benefits actually realized by the
Parent Indemnitee on account of such Losses in the year of such Loss or in any
of the preceding two (2) years or subsequent three (3) years of such Loss,
and the Parent Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
actually realize all available Tax benefits.

 

(vii) The amount of Losses that any Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any proceeds under the RandW Insurance Policy) or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the
Parent Indemnitee from any third party with respect to such Losses. The
Parent Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery
under all valid and collectible insurance policies (including the RandW
Insurance Policy) covering any Loss. Any amounts incurred by any Parent
Indemnitee (including without limitation legal fees and other professionals
fees and other costs) in connection with the pursuit of any recovery of
insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment described
above shall be considered Loss recoverable hereunder. In the event that any
insurance or other recovery is made by any Parent Indemnitee with respect to
any Loss for which such Parent Indemnitee has been indemnified hereunder, then
a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the insurance or other recovery
(net of any amounts described in the preceding sentence) shall be made
promptly by such Parent Indemnitee to the Member Representative (on behalf of
the Company Members in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares).

(viii) For purposes of this Article 9, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty for all
purposes, including for purposes of determining the scope or amount of any
Losses, and for purposes of determining the existence of any breach or
inaccuracy of such representation or warranty.

 



-56- (b) Any indemnity payment made under this Agreement shall be treated
by the Parties for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Merger
Consideration.

9.4 _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Company Members and their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, members, consultants,
financial advisors, counsel, accountants and other agents (each, a " _Member_
_Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Member_ _Indemnitees_ ") against and
in respect of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any of such Member
Indemnitees that result from or arise out of:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Merger Sub under Article 4 of this Agreement, in each case as of
the date of this Agreement, the Closing Date, and any specific date set forth
in such representation or warranty; or

 

(b) any breach of covenant, obligation or agreement on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement.

 

9.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Direct Claims_. If any Parent Indemnitee or any Member Indemnitee
(hereinafter an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall claim to have suffered a Loss
(other than with respect to any Third-Party Claim) for which indemnification
is available under Section 9.2 or 9.4, as the case may be (for purposes
of this Section 9.5, regardless of whether such Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive a payment in respect of such claim by virtue of the provisions of
Section 9.3 hereof), the Indemnified Party shall notify the party required to
provide indemnification (hereinafter an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing
of such claim. Such written notice shall describe the facts and circumstances
giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which indemnity is being sought, the
amount or estimated amount of the Loss, if known or reasonably ascertainable
at the time such claim is made (it being understood that this estimate shall
not operate to limit the rights of the Indemnified Party hereunder), and the
method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such Loss shall have occurred. Any dispute regarding the Indemnified Partys
entitlement to indemnification in connection with such claim shall be
resolved by any legally available means consistent with the provisions of
Section 12.8 herein or as otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties.

 

(b) _Third_ _-Party Claims_.

 

(i) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article
9 in respect of any claim, demand or other Action asserted by any Person who
is not a Party or an Affiliate thereof (a " _Third_ _-Party Claim_") shall
give the Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification with respect to such
Third-Party Claim is sought prompt written notice of such Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such written
notice shall describe the facts and circumstances

 



-57-  giving rise to such Third-Party Claim, the basis upon which indemnity is
being sought, the amount or estimated amount of the Losses relating to such
Third-Party Claim, if known or reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim
is made (it being understood that this estimate shall not operate to limit the
rights of the Indemnified Party hereunder), and the method of computation of
such Losses, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of
the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party only if the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the
Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party is
assuming the defense against such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim (1) for equitable or injunctive relief or (2) that alleges Losses
in excess of the Indemnifying Partys maximum indemnification
obligations under this Agreement and the Indemnified Party believes in good
faith that such allegation could reasonably be expected to lead to Losses in
excess of the Indemnifying Partys maximum indemnification obligation. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party does deliver notice as prescribed in this
Section 9.5(b)(ii) and thereby properly elects to conduct the defense of the
subject Third-Party Claim: (A) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and
make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; and (B) the Indemnifying Party
shall not be obligated to post a bond or provide other security required in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. In the event the Indemnifying Party
fails to give notice of its election to conduct the defense of a Third-Party
Claim within the time and as prescribed in this Section 9.5(b)(ii) or
otherwise elects not to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim pursuant
to this Section 9.5(b)(ii), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to control such defense. The party controlling the defense of any Third-Party
Claim shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other parties copies of
all correspondence, pleadings, motions, briefs, appeals or other written
statements relating to or submitted in connection with the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, and timely notices of, and the right to participate in (as
an observer), any hearing or other court proceeding relating to the Third-
Party Claim.

 

(iii) So long as the Indemnifying Party provides proper notice under
Section 9.5(b)(ii): (A) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.5(b)(ii); (B) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall include all legal fees and similar expenses
incurred in the defense of such Third-Party Claim) and participate in the
defense of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel of its own choosing at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if: (x) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (y) in
the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one (1) such
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third-Party Claim
(and any local counsel); and (C) the Indemnifying Party will not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),

 



-58-  consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the claimant in the applicable Third-Party Claim and such
settlement offer provides for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing
of the Indemnifying Partys willingness to accept the settlement offer and,
subject to the applicable limitations of this Article 9, pay the amount called
for by such offer, and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer,
the Indemnified Party may continue to contest such Third-Party Claim, free of
any participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the
amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept.

(v) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.5, the
provisions of Section 10.4 shall control with respect to any indemnity
relating to Taxes.

9.6 _Mitigation_. Following the Closing, each Indemnified Party shall
take commercially reasonable actions to mitigate all Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by it or any Indemnified Party that it
controls (including costs and expenses to remedy the circumstances giving
rise, or reasonably expected to give rise, to such Losses) upon becoming
aware of any fact, event or circumstance that has resulted in, or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, any such Loss.

 

9.7 _Nature of Representations and Warranties_. The sole purpose of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement is to allocate
financial responsibility pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement
should the representations and warranties prove to have been inaccurate, and
no other contractual rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in law or
in equity) are permitted to any Party hereto as a result of the untruth of any
such representation and warranty, other than in the case of Fraud.

 

9.8 _Escrow Release_. Within three (3) Business Days following the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the Member
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release to each Company Member an amount equal
to such Company Members Pro Rata Share of: (a) the balance of the funds in
the Escrow Account (including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned
on the Escrow Amount) __minus__ (b) the aggregate amount, if any, with respect
to which a Parent Indemnitee has reasonably and in good faith made a claim
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article 9 on or prior to the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date and for which the obligation
to indemnify, if any, has not been satisfied (any such claim, an "
_Unresolved Claim_ "). Following the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, once an Unresolved Claim is finally resolved, then within five
(5) Business Days after the final resolution of such Unresolved Claim and the
delivery to the applicable Parent Indemnitee of the amount to be delivered to
such Parent Indemnitee with respect to such Unresolved Claim from the funds
remaining in the Escrow Account (including any interest accrued or income
otherwise earned on the Escrow Amount), if any, Parent and the Member
Representative shall deliver joint written

 



-59-  instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
each Company Member an amount equal to such Company Members Pro Rata Share of
an amount equal to: (i) the aggregate amount of all funds then remaining in
the Escrow Account (including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned
on the Escrow Amount) __minus__ (ii) the amount delivered to such Parent
Indemnitee upon the resolution of such Unresolved Claim __minus__ (iii) the
aggregate amount, if any, associated with all remaining Unresolved Claims.

 

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, except with respect to
claims arising from Fraud and except for equitable relief to which any Party
hereto may be entitled pursuant to this Agreement, the sole and exclusive
remedy for any and all claims arising under, out of, or related to this
Agreement or the Merger shall be the rights of indemnification set forth in
this Article 9, and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or
recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of
such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and
released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Nothing in
this Section 9.9 shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy
on account of any Partys Fraud. The provisions of this Article 9 shall not
operate to limit the rights of any insured to recover under the RandW Insurance
Policy. The terms set forth in Section 9.5 shall be subject to the obligations
of any insured under the RandW Insurance Policy.

ARTICLE 10

 

TAX MATTERS

 

10.1 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other Action with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such filing of Tax Returns, audit, litigation or other Action and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties
agree: (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by any Party, any extensions
thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other
Parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if any other Party so requests,
each Party shall allow the other Parties to take possession of such books and
records. At the request of the Member Representative, Parent will cause
the Surviving Entity and any of its Subsidiaries to make, or join with the
Company Members in making, any election if the making of such election does
not have a material adverse effect on Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of
its Subsidiaries, as determined in the sole discretion of Parent exercised in
good faith.

(b) Except as provided in Section 10.1(c), and solely to the extent any
such actions would reasonably be expected to create or increase any Company
Members indemnity

 



-60-  obligations or other direct or indirect Tax liabilities or obligations,
after the Effective Time, none of Parent, the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries shall: (i) file, or permit to be filed, or amend or otherwise
modify, or permit to be amended or otherwise modified, any Tax Return for any
period beginning prior to the Closing Date; (ii) discuss, correspond,
negotiate, make or initiate any voluntary contact with any Governmental
Authority or representative thereof with respect to, or settle with any
Governmental Authority or representative thereof, any Tax liability of the
Company, the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
period beginning prior to the Closing Date or that may affect the Tax
liability of the Company Members for any period; (iii) extend or waive, or
cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or other period for
the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to any period beginning prior
to the Closing Date; or (iv) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect
to any period or portion of any period beginning prior to the Closing Date, in
each case without the prior written approval of the Member Representative,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.1(b),
Parent, the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries may take any action in
respect of U.S. domestic sales or use Taxes or Tax Returns, _provided_ that
(A) Parent, the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries provide prior written
notification to the Member Representative of such action and (B) no Company
Member shall have any Tax liability in respect of such action or that results
or arises, directly or indirectly, therefrom, other than under Section 9.2(a).

 

(c) Tax Returns for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods that are filed after the Closing Date shall be prepared by the
Companys Accountants, at the sole cost and expense of the Company Members.
All Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation of such Tax Returns.
Any such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those
previously prepared for prior Tax years or periods and filed in those
jurisdictions where the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company)
previously filed Tax Returns;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
agree that (i) all Transaction Deductions shall be treated as arising in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) Taxes related to unearned revenues that have
not been recognized for income Tax purposes by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on the Tax Returns for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
filed prior to the Closing Date shall not be included on any such Tax Returns
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and instead shall be included on the Tax
Returns that are filed after the Closing Date for Parent, the Surviving Entity
and any of their respective Subsidiaries for the Tax periods that begin on or
after the Closing Date. Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries not to, waive any carryback of a Tax attribute of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries generated or otherwise attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Parties shall, to the extent permitted or required
under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the Tax period
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes. Not less than
fourteen (14) days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return (including
extensions), a copy of any Tax Return proposed to be filed pursuant to this
Section 10.1(c) shall be delivered to Parent and the Member
Representative for their written approval. In the event of any dispute
between Parent and the Member Representative concerning such a Tax Return, the
decision of the Companys Accountants shall be final and binding on the
Parties, absent manifest error. To the extent not taken into account in the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Company Members shall pay
any and all Taxes due on such Tax Returns to Parent under this Section 10.1(c)
to the extent such Taxes are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period in
accordance with

 



-61-  Section 10.4 at least two (2) Business Days before the payment of Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) is due to the taxing authority.

 

(d) The Parties further agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Company Members or Parent
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

10.2 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne one-half by the Company
Members and one-half by Parent. Each such Transfer Tax shall be paid when due
by the Party on whom such Transfer Tax is imposed, and such Party shall be
promptly reimbursed for the other Partys share thereof after providing the
other Party with evidence of such payment.

 

10.3 _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. In any case where applicable
Law does not permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
the Tax period, the amount of Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall: (a) in the
case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or
assets of the Company, be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period; and (b) in the case of Taxes that are based
upon or related to income or receipts (including any income Taxes), be deemed
to be equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period ended on
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Taxes relating to any
transactions not in the ordinary course of business or otherwise unrelated to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that occur after the time of
the Closing on the Closing Date shall be treated as occurring on the day after
the Closing Date.

 

10.4 _Tax Refunds_. To the extent not taken into account in the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital and without duplication of
Section 9.3(a)(vii), the Company Members shall be entitled to any Tax refunds
or credits that are actually received by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any
of its Subsidiaries on or before the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the
Closing Date attributable to Taxes paid by the Company Members, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, net
of any reasonable costs to Parent in obtaining such refund or credit. Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid over to the Company Members any such refund or
the amount of any such credit within five (5) Business Days after actual
receipt of such refund or actual realization of such credit against Taxes. To
the extent such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be
returned to the applicable Governmental Authority, the Company Members agree
promptly to repay the amount of such refund or credit, together with any
interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Governmental
Authority, to Parent. After the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries to continue to work in good faith and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such Tax refunds or credits.

 



-62- 10.5 _Contests_. After the Closing Date, the Parties shall notify each
other in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of any notice of the
commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial Tax proceeding
relating to the Taxes of the Company in respect of Pre-Closing Tax Periods
or Straddle Periods (" _Pre-Closing Tax Proceedings_ "), the outcome of which
may affect the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations under this
Agreement of another Party. Such notice shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any Governmental Authority in respect of such
audit or other proceeding. Any failure to so notify the other Party of any
such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding shall not relieve such other Party of any
liability with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Proceedings except to the
extent such Party was actually prejudiced as a result thereof. The Member
Representative shall control the conduct, defense and settlement of any Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding solely to the extent the Company Members would be
liable for any assessment. Parent shall control the defense and settlement of
any other Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. In all cases, the Party in control of
such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding shall keep the non-controlling Party informed
of any proceedings, events, and developments relating to or in connection with
such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding and the non-controlling Party shall be
entitled to receive copies of all substantive correspondence and documents
relating to such audit or other proceeding. If the resolution of any Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding would be grounds for indemnification under
this Agreement by the Party not in control of the conduct of such audit or
other proceeding or otherwise adversely affect the Tax Liability of such non-
controlling Party: (a) the controlling Party shall consult with the non-
controlling Party and shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any
such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding without the non-controlling Partys prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; and (b) __ at its own cost and expense, the non-controlling Party
shall have the right to participate (but not control) in the defense of such
Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. In the event of any conflict between this Section
__ 10.5 and Section __ 9.5(b), this Section __ 10.5 shall control.

10.6 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and any of the Company Members and their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall
be terminated prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

10.7 _Tax Elections_. The Company shall not, and none of the Company
Members shall cause the Company to, elect under Section 1101(g)(4) of Title XI
of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, H.R. 1314, Public Law Number 114-74 (the
" _Title XI Partnership Audit Provisions_ ") to have the amendments made by
such provisions apply to any Tax Return of the Company relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

(a) Each Party hereto irrevocably agrees that any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought and determined in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California sitting in the County of Orange (or, if subject
matter jurisdiction in that court is not available, in the state courts of

shall not bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid
courts), and each Party hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any
such Action for itself and in respect to its property, generally and

Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Action: (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process; (ii)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of such courts
or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of

judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (iii) that (A) such Action
in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum; (B) the venue of such
Action is improper; and (C) this Agreement, the transactions contemplated

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH

ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY

any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such rights preclude any other or further exercise
thereof.

 

12.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any
term, provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, illegal, void,
unenforceable or against regulatory policy, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the

disbursements of counsel, financial advisors, brokers, finders, investment
bankers and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

fees, costs and expenses.

12.13 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

12.14 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof.

-69-  or section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed on
all Schedules and in all parts or sections of the Disclosure Schedules to the
extent that the relevance of such disclosure to another section is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross reference thereto; (b) no disclosure of any matter
contained in the Disclosure Schedules shall create an implication that such
matter meets any standard of materiality; (c) any disclosures contained in the
Disclosure Schedules which refer to a document are qualified in their entirety
by reference to the text of such document; and (d) headings and introductory
language have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedules for convenience of
reference only and shall to no extent have the effect of amending or changing
the express description of the sections as set forth in this Agreement.

 

12.16 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that, if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed as required by their
specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, irreparable damage will occur
to the other Parties, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would
be difficult to determine. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable) and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. No Party
shall oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to raise as a defense
that an adequate remedy at law exists or that specific performance or
equitable or injunctive relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason with respect to any breach of this Agreement. Each
of the Parties hereby waives: (a) any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate;
and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. The Parties further agree that by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 12.16, (i) a Party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that
the remedies provided for in this Section 12.16 are not available or
otherwise are not granted; and (ii) nothing in this Section 12.16 shall
require any Party to institute any Action for (or limit any Partys right to
institute any Action for) specific performance under this Section 12.16 prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 11 (or
pursuing damages prior to or after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 12.16 or anything set
forth in this Section 12.16 restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 11 or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. If
any Party brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by: (A) the amount of time during which such Action
is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days; or (B) such other time period
established by the California court presiding over such Action.

 

12.17 _Member Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment; Authority_. For purposes of this Agreement, each Company
Member shall, without any further action on the part of any such Company
Member, be deemed (by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger) to
have consented to the appointment of John Kruger as the 

 



-70-  representative and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of such Company Member
(in his capacity as such, the " _Member Representative_ "), with full power
of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of such Company Member
for purposes taking any and all actions and making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken by the Member Representative under or contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including the exercise of the
power to: (i) execute this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any other
agreements, documents and certificates pursuant to such agreements, including
all amendments to such agreements, and take all actions required or permitted
to be taken under such agreements; (ii) resolve, agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, indemnification or other claims; (iii)
receive and forward notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement and
any Ancillary Agreement; and (iv) take all other actions necessary, desirable
or appropriate in the judgment of the Member Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any other
agreements, documents and certificates pursuant thereto. John Kruger hereby
accepts his appointment as the Member Representative. All decisions, actions,
consents and instructions of the Member Representative shall be final and
binding upon all the Company Members, and no Company Member shall have any
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same, except for
fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct.

 

(b) _Replacement_. The Company Members entitled to at least a majority of
the Final Merger Consideration can appoint a new Member Representative by
written consent and by sending notice and a copy of the duly executed written
consent appointing such new Member Representative to Parent. Such appointment
will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the
date such consent is received by Parent.

(c) _Expenses and Liabilities_. Any fees, costs, expenses or other
Liabilities incurred by the Member Representative in connection with the
performance of its duties under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement ("
_Member Representative Expenses_ ") shall not be the personal obligation of
the Member Representative but shall be payable by and attributable to the
Company Members (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share). The
Member Representative Expenses shall be satisfied from the Member
Representative Reimbursement Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that the Member Representative Reimbursement Fund is exhausted prior to fully
satisfying the Member Representative Expenses, from the Company Members,
severally and not jointly, on a Pro Rata Share basis. The Member
Representative may from time to time submit invoices to the Company Members
covering such Member Representative Expenses and, upon the request of any
Company Member, shall provide such Company Member with an accounting of all
Member Representative Expenses paid. As soon as practicable after the date on
which the final obligation of the Member Representative under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement have been discharged or such other date as
Member Representative deems appropriate, the Member Representative shall
release to each Company Member an amount equal to such Company Members Pro
Rata Share of the balance of the funds in the Member Representative
Reimbursement Fund (including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned
on the Member Representative Reimbursement Amount).

(d) _No Liability_. Neither the Member Representative nor any agent
employed by the Member Representative shall incur any Liability to any Company
Member relating to the

 



-71-  performance of its duties hereunder except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Member Representative
shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in
respect of any Company Member, except in respect of amounts actually received
on behalf of such Company Member. The Member Representative shall not be
required to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance of any
of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

12.18 _Conflicts; Privileges_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company has retained
Baker and Hostetler LLP (" _BakerHostetler_ ") to act as its counsel in

the status of a client of BakerHostetler for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises between

its Subsidiaries), BakerHostetler may represent the Company Member or any
such Affiliate in such dispute, even though the interests of the Company
Member or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity or any

Company or a Subsidiary in a manner substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Parent hereby waives, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries): (i) any claim that it has or may have that BakerHostetler has a
conflict in interest in connection with or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representations; and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Effective Time between Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries) and any
Company Member or any of its Affiliates, BakerHostetler may represent any such
party in such dispute, even though the interest of any such party may be
directly adverse to Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries), and even though BakerHostetler may have
represented the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries.

client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to
the Company and may be controlled by the

 



-72-  Member Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
the Effective Time, the Member Representative shall be permitted to remove or
redact from the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates any
portion (and only such portion) of any email, document and other records
containing Privileged Information. The Member Representative agrees that any
email, document and other record temporarily removed for analysis to determine
the presence of Privileged Information pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 12.18(e) shall be returned to the Company or its
Subsidiaries promptly following the completion of such review if it is
determined by the Member Representative that such email, document or other
record does not contain Privileged Information.
