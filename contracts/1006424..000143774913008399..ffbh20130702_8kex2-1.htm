 **ARTICLE II ** 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.1. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Arkansas Business Corporation Act of 1987,
as amended (the " _ABCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Company shall merge with
and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Arkansas. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Company shall cease.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective upon filing
on the Closing Date of the Articles of Merger (as set forth in Section
4-27-1109 of the ABCA, the " _Articles of Merger_ "), executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the ABCA, with the Secretary of State of the
State of Arkansas. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when
the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., Little Rock, Arkansas time, at the offices of Kutak Rock
LLP, 124 West Capitol Avenue, Little Rock, Arkansas on a date no later than
three (3) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions and
the continued satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions set forth in
Article VIII), or such other date as mutually agreed to by the Parties (the "
_Closing Date_ ").

 



 

Section 2.4. _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes
of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement
and until the Closing Date, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any
action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any
action not to be taken, which action or failure to act could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant
provisions of the ABCA.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Company or the holder of
any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _No Effect on Parent Common Stock_. Each share of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock. _

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
Shareholders each Company Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Parent Stock Consideration
and the Per Share Cash Consideration (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
ascribed below:

 



 

(A) " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " shall equal (x) $74,000,000,
divided by (y) the number of fully diluted Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without interest thereon.

 



 

(B) " _Per Share Parent Stock Consideration_ " shall mean that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) 6,252,400, divided by (y) the
number of fully diluted Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares,
each former shareholder of Company shall receive in cash an amount equal to
the fair market value of his fractional interest, which fair market value
shall be determined by multiplying such fraction by the price per share of
Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date (as reported by NASDAQ).

 



 

(iv) _Excluded Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Company Share issued
and outstanding and held in the Company's treasury or owned by the Parent or
any of the Company's direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries or
authorized but unissued immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall cease to be outstanding, and shall be cancelled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

 



 

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder who
is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, payment of the fair value of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
4-27-1302 of the ABCA (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" shall mean any shares of Company Common Stock
as to which a Dissenting Shareholder has properly exercised a demand for
payment of fair value pursuant to Section 4-27-1323 of the ABCA. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to any Merger
Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder's right to demand payment of the fair value of its Dissenting Shares
under the ABCA, and any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment contemplated by Section 4-27-1325 of the ABCA with respect to
the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder and not any Merger
Consideration. Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for payment of the fair value of Dissenting Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law received by Company relating to shareholders' demands for
payment of fair value and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for payment of the fair value of
Dissenting Shares under the ABCA. Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for payment of the fair value of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.7. _Reserved_.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Company Common Stock
certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) shall be exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, in accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(a) Parent shall appoint Registrar and Transfer Company, as the Person to
act as exchange agent under this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and
which shall serve pursuant to an agreement among Parent and the Exchange Agent
that is approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the Company Shareholders,
(i) certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) representing the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, the " _Parent
Stock_ ") to be delivered to the Company Shareholders in the Merger and (ii)
an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid to
Company Shareholders in the Merger.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's
message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify
subject to the Company's reasonable approval), together with instructions
thereto. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
a certificate, the surrender of such certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent, in
each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive (and the Exchange Agent shall
deliver) (A) certificates (or electronic equivalents) representing the number
of shares of Parent Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been converted in the Merger and (B) a check for an amount equal to the
Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Shares to be
converted.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) If any certificate (or electronic equivalent) for such Parent Stock or
check is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer taxes or other taxes
required by reason of issuance in a name other than the registered holder of
the certificate (or electronic equivalent) surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

(d) In no event shall the holder of any such surrendered certificates (or
electronic equivalents) be entitled to receive interest on any of the Cash
Consideration to be received in the Merger.

 



 

(e) Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the Company
Shareholders for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares, in each case without any interest thereon. Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be authorized to pay the Merger Consideration to any
holder of Company Common Stock whose certificate has been lost or destroyed,
upon receipt of appropriate indemnification and satisfactory evidence of
ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby.

 



 

(f) None of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
funds deposited with the Exchange Agent delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
portion of such funds which remains undistributed to the holders of
certificates of Company Common Stock for two years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the funds would otherwise
escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the funds deposited with the
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment losses resulting
from such investments shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.9. _No Further Rights or Transfers; Cancellation of Treasury
Shares_. Other than Dissenting Shares as described in Section 2.6(d) and
except for the right to surrender of the certificate(s) (or evidence of shares
in book entry form) representing the Company Common Stock in exchange for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Share
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock, at and after the
Effective Time, all Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist at the Effective
Time and each holder of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as
a shareholder of the Company, and no transfer of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.10. _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent or Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any
provisions of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Reservation of Shares_. Parent agrees that (a) prior to the
Effective Time, it will take appropriate action to reserve a sufficient number
of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Stock to be issued in accordance
with this Agreement, and (b) at the Effective Time, Parent will issue and
reserve for issuance shares of Parent Stock to the extent set forth in, and in

_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (provided that each exception set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify any other
representation and warranty to the extent that the relevance of such exception
to such other representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on the face
of the disclosure) Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:

 



 

 



   



 

Section 4.1. _Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Arkansas
and has all corporate powers required to own, lease and operate its properties
and carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those

Company has delivered to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Company's
articles of incorporation and its bylaws.

 



 

Section 4.2. _Authorization_.

approved by all requisite action on the part of the Company, and no other
proceedings (corporate or otherwise) on the part of the Company are necessary
to approve and authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent, constitutes the valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability hereof or thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other applicable Law
affecting creditors' rights generally and limitations on the availability of
equitable remedies.

only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company necessary for the Company to approve or adopt this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "), and no separate vote of any

of its Subsidiaries in connection with (i) the execution and delivery by
Company of this Agreement or (ii) the consummation of the transactions

Plan or employment, severance or similar agreement that provides for the
gross-up of the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any

payment of deferred compensation that will not be in compliance with Section
409A of the Code.

Section 409A of the Code.

settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection

proposal or offer for a Company Competing Transaction by any Person at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) may reasonably be likely to result in a
transaction that, if consummated, would result in such third party (or its
shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 65% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in
a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company on terms more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Merger (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time)
and is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed
(taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal, all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and this
Agreement) (a " _Superior Company Competing Transaction_ "), then the Company
may, in response to an unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance
with this Section 7.7(a), (1) furnish confidential information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person proposing such Superior Company
Competing Transaction (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary

been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person, and (2) participate in discussions and
negotiations with the Person proposing such Superior Company Competing
Transaction (and its Representatives) regarding such Superior Company
Competing Transaction; if and only to the extent that (A) prior to taking such
actions outlined in (1) and (2) above, the Company Board determines in good
faith (after taking into account advice of outside counsel) that it is
required to do so in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, (B) prior to
making the determination that any proposal could result in a Superior Company
Competing Transaction, the Company Board notifies Parent promptly (but in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours) of any such inquiry, proposal or offer
received by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Company Competing Transaction and the identity of the Person
making such Superior Company Competing Transaction, and (C) the Superior
Company Competing Transaction was made after the date of this Agreement and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.7(a). The Company
agrees that it shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a timely basis, of
the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations and will notify Parent promptly of any
determination by the Company Board that a Superior Company Competing
Transaction has been made.

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) Nothing contained in this Section 7.7(a) or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to its
shareholders if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, and with the
advice of outside counsel, making such disclosure to the Company's
shareholders is required under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that

to take, any action prohibited by this Section 7.7(a).

or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company
Competing Transaction (any action described in this clause (iv) being referred
to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval and subject to prior compliance with Section
7.7(a), the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if:

 



 

(1) an unsolicited Company Competing Transaction that the Company Board
reasonably determines (after consultation with the Company's outside counsel
and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Company Competing Transaction
was made after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn;

 



 

(2) the Company Board determines in good faith (after taking into account
advice of outside counsel) that, in light of such Superior Company Competing
Transaction, the making of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination of this Agreement is required in order for the Company Board to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law;

 



 

(3) neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7.7(a) in any material respect; and

 



 

 



   



 

(4) the Company delivers written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior
Company Competing Transaction_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
material terms and conditions of any Superior Company Competing Transaction
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Company Competing Transaction shall require a
new Notice of Superior Company Competing Transaction and a new three (3)
Business Day period), and after the third (3rd) Business Day following
delivery of the Notice of Superior Company Competing Transaction to Parent and
after negotiating in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed
with the Merger and taking into account any revised terms since receipt of the
Notice of Superior Company Competing Transaction, the Company Board continues
to determine in good faith that the Company Competing Transaction constitutes
a Superior Company Competing Transaction.

and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information

compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
matter.

prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

Section 10.9. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is

rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of

IRREVOCABLE PROXY AND VOTING AGREEMENT

 



 

This IRREVOCABLE PROXY AND VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as
of July [●], 2013, is entered into by and among First Federal Bancshares of
Arkansas, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (" _Parent_ "), and [●] (the "
_Majority Shareholder_ "). Capitalized terms used but not separately defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger Agreement
(as defined below).

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") with [●], an
Arkansas corporation (the " _Company_ "), Parent has requested the Majority
Shareholder, and the Majority Shareholder has agreed, to enter into this
Agreement with respect to all shares of common stock of the Company that the
Majority Shareholder beneficially owns or may hereafter acquire (collectively,
the " _Shares_ ");

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms and conditions set forth below,
the parties agree as follows:

 



 

Section 1. _ _ _Voting Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The Majority Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees to vote all Shares that the Majority Shareholder is entitled to vote,
at the time of any vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and all agreements related to the Merger and any actions related thereto at
any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, and at any adjournment
thereof, at which such Merger Agreement and other related agreements (or any
amended version thereof), or such other actions, are submitted for the
consideration and vote of the shareholders of the Company, in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Majority Shareholder hereby agrees that it will not vote any
Shares that the Majority Shareholder is entitled to vote in favor of the
approval of any (i) Company Competing Transaction, (ii) reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any other
extraordinary transaction involving the Company, (iii) corporate action the
consummation of which would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or delay the
consummation, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (iv)
other matter relating to, or in connection with, any of the foregoing matters.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs 1(a) and (b) above, in the
event the Company is entitled to exercise its rights to terminate the Merger
Agreement under Section 9.1 thereof, nothing contained herein shall prevent
the Majority Shareholder from taking such action, in its capacity as an
officer, director or shareholder of the Company, as may be necessary to
properly assert such rights.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) With respect to any Shares held of record on behalf or for the benefit
of the Majority Shareholder or its immediate family by a custodian or trustee
(including shares held in an IRA account or self-employed profit sharing
account), the Majority Shareholder agrees to take such action as may be
necessary to cause the custodian or trustee to vote such Shares in accordance
with the provisions of paragraphs 1(a) and (b) above.

 



 

Section 2. _Irrevocable Proxy_. __ The Majority Shareholder hereby
revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Shares
beneficially owned by the Majority Shareholder. By entering into this

substitution, for and in the Majority Shareholder's name, to vote, express,
consent or dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power solely for the
purposes contemplated by Section 1 above as Parent or its proxy or substitute
shall, in Parent' sole discretion, deem proper with respect to the Shares
beneficially owned by the Majority Shareholder. THE PROXY GRANTED BY THE
MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 2 IS IRREVOCABLE AND THE
APPOINTMENT IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST, HAVING BEEN GRANTED IN CONSIDERATION

Majority Shareholder. If the Majority Shareholder is executing this Agreement
in a representative or fiduciary capacity, the person signing this Agreement
