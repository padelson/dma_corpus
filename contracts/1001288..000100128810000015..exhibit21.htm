AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") dated as of May 20, 2010
is entered into by and among LEXMARK INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Delaware
corporation, with its principal office located in Lexington, Kentucky
("Buyer"); 2010 PARIS ACQUISITION CO., a Delaware corporation ("MergerCo");
PERCEPTIVE SOFTWARE INC., a Delaware corporation, with its principal office
located in Shawnee, Kansas ("Seller"); and Pete Chung, as the Stockholders'
Agent, solely for the purpose of Sections 8.3 through 8.6 hereof.

 

 

RECITALS

 

 

A. The respective Boards of Directors of each of Seller, Buyer and MergerCo
believe it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders that Seller and MergerCo combine into a single company through
the statutory merger of MergerCo with and into Seller with Seller as the
Surviving Corporation (the "Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have
approved the Merger.

 

 

B. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
stockholders of the Seller are executing and delivering Non-Disclosure and
Non-Competition Agreements with the Buyer and certain employees of the
Seller are executing and delivering Executive Employment Agreements in favor
of the Buyer.

 

 

AGREEMENT

 

 

In consideration of the representations, warranties, agreements, provisions
and covenants set forth below, Buyer, MergerCo and Seller hereby agree as
follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I.

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2(b)) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Certificate of
Merger") and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), MergerCo shall be merged with and into Seller,
the separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall cease and Seller shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").

 

 

1.2. Closing of the Merger

 

 

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time, at the offices of
Dinsmore and Shohl LLP, 255 E. Fifth Street, Suite 1900, Cincinnati, Ohio
45202, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than
five (5) business days following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VI and VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions) or at such

 

  
 

 

 

 

   

  
 

other time, date and place as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree (the date on
which the Closing occurs being referred to as the "Closing Date").

 

 

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing
being the "Effective Time").

 

 

1.3. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, MergerCo shall be merged
with and into Seller and the separate existence of MergerCo shall cease,
Seller shall be the Surviving Corporation and the separate existence of
Seller, with all its purposes, objects, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, the title to all real estate and other property owned by
Seller and MergerCo shall vest in Seller without reversion or impairment, and
all the liabilities of Seller and MergerCo shall remain or become, as the
case may be, the liabilities of Seller.

 

 

1.4. The Merger Consideration. The total consideration to be paid by Buyer in
the Merger (the "Merger Consideration") shall be comprised of the following:

 

 

(a) Closing Date Cash Consideration. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the amount of Two Hundred Eighty
Million Dollars ($280,000,000.00) less (i) any fees and expenses payable to
Morgan Stanley in connection with the Merger and any and all transaction
related expenses of Seller, including, but not limited to accounting, legal,
tax, financial advisors and other professional fees and costs, incurred in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (collectively the "Transaction Expenses");
and (ii) the Escrow Fund provided for in Section 1.4(b) of this Agreement
(the "Closing Date Cash Consideration"). The Closing Date Cash Consideration
will be distributed to the stockholders of the Seller (the "Stockholders") as
described in Section 1.7 of this Agreement.

 

 

 

(b) Escrow Fund. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit with Computershare
or its successor in interest or other institution selected by Buyer with the
consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent") cash in the amount of Twenty-Eight Million Dollars
($28,000,000) in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of
Seller under Section 8.2(b) hereof. Such deposit (together with any income
thereon) will constitute the Escrow Fund ( the "Escrow Fund") to be held by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"). All costs, fees, charges and
expenses assessed by Escrow Agent to maintain the escrow account as required
hereunder, and any and all penalties, obligations and liabilities associated
therewith or arising therefrom shall be paid by Buyer. On the date that
represents the fifteenth month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow
Termination Date") any amounts remaining (i) after the payment and
satisfaction of any and all indemnification claims under Section 8.2(b), and
(ii) net of any amounts held back for the purposes of pending claims, shall be
distributed to the Stockholders in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. All
earnings and interest accrued on the Escrow Fund shall remain in the Escrow
Fund until

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

2  

  
 

 

  
termination of the escrow, and shall be released, subject to any pending
claims, to the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent shall manage and disburse the
contents of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement and this Section 1.4(b).

 

 

 

(c) Transaction Expenses. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Persons entitled thereto, the amount of all Transaction
Expenses.

 

 

 

1.5 MergerCo Common Stock. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Buyer, MergerCo,
Seller or any holder of any share of Seller Common Stock or Seller Preferred
Stock (each as defined in Section 1.7(a)), each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be converted into and become one fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock"). Such shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock will constitute all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time.

 

 

 

1.6 Dissenting Shares; Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any holder of shares of Seller Common Stock or
Seller Preferred Stock who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights
("Eligible Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7, but rather
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such appraisal rights as are
granted by the DGCL.

 

 

  

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of Eligible Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
its appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article I, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Seller Common
Stock or Seller Preferred Stock ("Certificate") in the manner provided in
Section 1.7.

 

  

 

 

1.7 Conversion of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred Stock; Designation
of Paying Agent; Distribution of Closing Date Cash Consideration.

 

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, automatically and by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Seller, Buyer or MergerCo, each
issued and outstanding share of (i) common stock, par value $0.001 per share
of Seller (the "Seller Common Stock"), and (ii) preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share of Seller, including the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock, and the Series B Preferred Stock (the "Seller Preferred
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Eligible Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.4(d)) and treasury
stock as provided in Section 1.8) shall be converted and exchanged for the
right to receive (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Closing Amount
(as defined below); plus (B) any cash disbursements required to be made from
the Escrow Fund with respect to such share of Seller Common Stock or Seller
Preferred

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

3  

  
 

 

Stock to the former holder thereof in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement (as and when such disbursements are required to be made). All
shares of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Closing Date Cash Consideration therefore upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7, without interest. The "Per
Share Closing Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the (1) Closing Date Cash Consideration by (2) the sum of the
aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall calculate and the amount
of consideration payable to each Stockholder and deliver a statement to Buyer
containing the following information (the "Closing Date Cash Consideration
Calculation"): (i) the aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses paid or
payable (including any Transaction Expenses that will become payable after the
Effective Time with respect to services performed or actions taken prior to
the Effective Time); and (ii) with respect to each Stockholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (A) the name and address of record of each
Stockholder, (B) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock and Seller
Preferred Stock of each class and series held by each such Stockholder, (C)
the consideration that each such stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant
to this Section 1.7, and (D) the cash amount to be contributed to the Escrow
Fund with respect to the shares of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred
Stock held by each such Stockholder.

 

 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer and Seller will (i) designate
Computershare or other commercial bank or trust company to act as the paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the benefit of Stockholders (other than the
Eligible Dissenting Shares) in the Merger, and Buyer (or MergerCo) will enter
into a Paying Agent Agreement acceptable to Seller with the Paying Agent (the
"Paying Agent Agreement"), pursuant to which, after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent will distribute the Closing Date Cash Consideration on a timely
basis, and (ii) irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent the Closing Date Cash Consideration pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the cash contemplated to be paid to Stockholders pursuant to Section
1.4(a) and Section 1.7 out of the funds held for such purpose, which funds
shall not be used for any other purpose. Buyer shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses of the Paying Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to receive
any and all interest on the funds held by Paying Agent pursuant to the Paying
Agent Agreement.

 

 

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller may provide the letter of transmittal,
substantially in the form of Exhibit C (the "Letter of Transmittal"), to
certain of its Stockholders. If a Letter of Transmittal is delivered and a
Certificate is properly surrendered to Buyer prior to the Closing, then Buyer
shall pay the portion of the Closing Date Cash Consideration to be paid to the
holder of such Certificate pursuant to Section 1.7 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds at the Closing. As promptly as reasonably
practicable (but in any event within three business days) after the Effective
Time, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record who did not deliver a completed Letter of
Transmittal to Buyer at the Closing: (i) a Letter of Transmittal and (ii)
instructions for use in

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

4  

  
 

effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the aggregate
Closing Date Cash Consideration previously represented by such Certificates,
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

 

(e) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation,
together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
its portion of the Closing Date Cash Consideration in accordance with Section
1.7 for each share of Seller Common Stock or Seller Preferred Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, to be distributed as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (after giving effect to any required tax withholding)
in each case without interest, and the Certificate so surrendered will
immediately be cancelled. Until surrendered and exchanged, each outstanding
Certificate which, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Seller
Common Stock or Seller Preferred Stock, shall be deemed to represent and

against it in accordance with its terms, subject, however, as to enforcement,
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and

acceleration of any obligation, or result in the creation of any mortgages,
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any

or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state or local
government or any court, administrative agency, commission or other

Entity"), is required by or with respect to Seller in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller or the consummation by
Seller of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (a) the

if applicable, and other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust
Laws, (b) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as contemplated by Section
1.1 and (c) such approvals as may be required under applicable federal, state

flows (together with the auditors' report thereon) for the year ended June 30,
2009, together with notes to such financial statements (the "Audited Financial
Statements"), and (b) unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied throughout the
periods covered thereby, present fairly in all material respects, as of their
respective dates, the financial condition and results of operations of
Seller (subject, in the case of Interim Financial Statements, to the
disclosures contained in any notes thereto and normal, recurring year-end
adjustments that may be required upon audit and the omission of footnote
disclosures) and are consistent with the books and records of Seller.

 

 

 

2.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.7,
between the date of the Audited Financial Statements and the date of this
Agreement, Seller has conducted its business only in the ordinary course and
(a) there has not occurred any events or changes that have had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect and (b) Seller has not taken any action that would
have been prohibited under subsections (c), (h), (i), (k), (l), (n), (o) or
(s) of Section 4.3 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, "Seller Material
Adverse Effect" means any event, change, effect, development, circumstance or
occurrence (each, an "Effect") that, individually, or together with any other
Effect (A) has or would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on the business, financial condition, results of operations or financial
performance of Seller, or (B) materially impairs the ability of Seller to
consummate the Merger contemplated by this Agreement; provided that "Seller
Material Adverse Effect" shall not be deemed to include the impact of, and
none of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or would be, a Seller Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Effects of
compliance with this Agreement, including such compliance as consented to by
Buyer (ii) Effects after the date of this Agreement resulting from changes in
general economic or industry conditions except to the extent that such changes
affect Seller in a manner disproportionate to the effect of companies in its

in supplier, distributor, partner or similar relationships) resulting from and
attributable to the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, (iv) Effects resulting from or arising out of any natural
disaster or any acts of terrorism, sabotage, military action or war or any
escalation or worsening thereof, (v) Effects directly resulting from any
event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances disclosed in or
incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Schedules, with respect to the
Seller, or (vi) Effects resulting from or arising out of changes in GAAP or
applicable laws.

 

 

 

2.8 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.8, Seller does
not have any material liability (whether known or unknown, whether asserted
or unasserted, whether absolute or contingent, whether accrued or unaccrued,
whether liquidated or unliquidated, and whether due or to become due,
including any liability for taxes), except for (a) liabilities set forth

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

8  

  
 

on the face of or reserved for in the Financial Statements (rather than in any
notes thereto), (b) liabilities that have arisen after the date of the Interim
Financial Statements in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, (c) those incurred by the Seller in connection with this Agreement
and (d) those not required to be reflected in the liabilities column of a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 

 

2.9 Compliance with Laws. Seller has complied in all material respects with
all applicable laws (including rules, regulations, codes, plans, injunctions,
judgments, orders, decrees, rulings and charges thereunder) of any
Governmental Entity. Schedule 2.9 sets forth a true and correct list of all
material licenses, permits (including environmental and occupancy permits),
certificates, registrations, approvals, franchises, consents and other
authorizations of Seller obtained from or filed with a Governmental Entity and
used in connection with Seller's business (the "Permits") necessary in
connection with the operation of Seller's business, and, except as set forth
on Schedule 2.9, Seller holds all such Permits in full force and effect.
Seller is not in violation of such Permits, and there is no pending or, to
Seller's Knowledge, threatened revocation, cancellation or suspension of any
such Permit.

 

 

 

2.10 Taxes.

 

 

(a) Seller duly and timely filed all tax returns, schedules, declarations, and
tax-related documents (collectively, "Tax Returns") that it was required to
file under applicable laws and regulations. All such Tax Returns were correct
and complete in all material respects and were prepared in material
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All Taxes (as defined in
Section 2.10) due and owing by Seller (whether or not shown on any Tax Return)
have been paid, other than any Taxes for which adequate reserves satisfying
the provisions of subsection (g) below and Section 4.9 have been established
on the Seller's balance sheet. Seller is not currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, other than income Tax
Returns for Seller's fiscal 2009 taxable year. No claim has ever been made by
an authority in a jurisdiction where Seller does not file Tax Returns that
Seller is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no
Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the
assets of Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" means any federal,
state, local, foreign, or other tax (whether income, sales, use, franchise,
transfer, withholding, excise, real or personal property, employment or other
kind of tax), assessment, levy, fee, impost, withholding, or other similar
governmental charge, and shall include all interest and penalties thereon.

 

  

 

(b) Seller has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party.

 

  

 

(c) No Seller or director or officer (or employee responsible for Tax matters)
of Seller expects any authority to assess any additional Taxes for any period
for which Tax Returns have been filed. No federal, state, local, or non-U.S.
tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are pending or being
conducted with respect to Seller. Seller has not received from any
Governmental Entity or other taxing authority (including jurisdictions where
Seller has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent to open
an audit or other

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

  
review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice
of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted,
or assessed by any Governmental Entity or other taxing authority against
Seller, that has not been resolved. Schedule 2.10(c) lists all federal, state,
local, and non-U.S. income Tax Returns filed with respect to Seller for
taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2005, indicates those Tax
Returns that have been audited, and indicates those Tax Returns that currently
are the subject of audit. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer
correct and complete copies of all income Tax Returns, examination reports,
and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by Seller filed
or received since December 31, 2005.

 

  

 

(d) Seller has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency
that is still in effect. Seller has not received any written ruling related to
Taxes or entered into any agreement with any Governmental Entity or other
taxing authority relating to Taxes.

 

  

 

(e) Seller is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that
has resulted or could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment
of (i) any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code § 280G (or
any corresponding provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law), other than
any such agreement, contract, arrangement or plan for which stockholder
approval satisfying the requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5) and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder will be obtained prior to the Closing, or (ii)
any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of Code §162(m) (or
any corresponding provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law). Seller has
not been a "United States real property holding corporation" within the
meaning of Code §897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code
§897(c)(1)(A)(ii). None of the assets of Seller are "tax exempt use property"
within the meaning of Code §168(h). Seller has disclosed on its federal income
Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code §6662. Seller
is not a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement.
Seller (A) has not been a member of any "affiliated group" within the meaning
of Code §1504(a) or any similar group defined under a similar provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. law filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Seller) and (B) does not
have any liability for the Taxes of any Person under Reg. §1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Person" means any natural person, corporation, limited liability company,
general partnership, limited partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, union,
association, Governmental Entity or other business organization.

 

  

 

(f) Seller has no deferred gains or losses arising out of any intercompany
transactions.

 

  

 

(g) The unpaid Taxes of Seller (i) did not, as of the most recent fiscal month
end, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the most recent balance sheet (rather than
in any notes thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of

  
 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

  
Seller in filing its Tax Returns. Since the date of the most recent balance
sheet, Seller has not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from
extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, other than any
items arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  

 

(h) Seller will not be required to include any item of income in, or exclude
any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date that would give rise to a liability for
Taxes for such taxable period or portion thereof as a result of any: (i)
change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code §7121 (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) "intercompany
transaction" or "excess loss account" described in Treasury Regulations under
Code §1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. income Tax law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction
disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; or (v) prepaid amount
received on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

  

 

(i) Seller has not distributed stock of another Person, and has not had its
stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code §355 or Code §361.

 

  

 

(j) Seller is not and has not been a party to any "reportable transaction," as
defined in Code §6707A(c)(1) and Reg. §1.6011-4(b).

disclosure of Confidential Information (as defined in Section 2.11(u)) or
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property rights in any
Seller-Owned IP Rights by any third party, including any employee or former
employee of Seller. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.11(n), Seller has not
brought any legal proceeding for infringement or misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property.

date of this Agreement, Seller has not received written notice of any charge,
complaint, demand, suit, claim, action, investigation, or proceeding which
involves a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any Third Party
Intellectual Property Right or which contests the validity, ownership or right
of Seller to exercise any Intellectual Property right or which involves a
claim

  
 

 

 

 

 

14  

  
 

  
that Seller has breached or is not in compliance with the terms of any
contract governing the use of Open Source Materials or that any Seller Product
(or any portion thereof) is required to be (i) disclosed or distributed in
source code form, (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or
(iii) redistributable at no charge, in each case pursuant to the terms of any
contract governing the use of Open Source Materials. Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.11(o), between January 1, 2008 and the date of this Agreement,
Seller has not received any written communication challenging the validity,
enforceability, or Seller's ownership of, any Seller-Owned IP Rights.

 

  

 

(p) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.11(p), to the Seller's Knowledge, the
operation of Seller's business, including (i) the design, development,
manufacturing, reproduction, marketing, licensing, sale, offer for sale,
importation, distribution, provision and/or use of any Seller Product and (ii)
Seller's use of any product, device or process used in Seller's business, does
not infringe or misappropriate any Third Party Intellectual Property Right and
does not constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the
laws of any jurisdiction in a manner reasonably expected to result in a Seller
Material Adverse Effect, and to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no
substantial basis for a claim that the design, development, manufacturing,
reproduction, marketing, licensing, sale, offer for sale, importation,
distribution, provision and/or use of any Seller Product or the operation of
Seller's business is infringing or has infringed on or misappropriated any
Third Party Intellectual Property Right.

 

  

 

(q) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Seller-Owned IP Rights, the
Seller Products, or Seller is subject to any proceeding (other than normal
prosecution of patent and trademark applications in any foreign or domestic
Patent and Trademark Office), outstanding order or stipulation (i)
restricting in any manner the use, transfer, or licensing by Seller of any
Seller-Owned IP Right or any Seller Product, or which would reasonably be
expected to affect the validity, use or enforceability of any such Seller-
Owned IP Right or Seller Product, or (ii) restricting the conduct of the
business of Seller in any respect in order to accommodate Third Party
Intellectual Property Rights.

 

  

 

(r) Seller has taken commercially reasonable efforts to secure valid written
assignments from all of Seller's current and former consultants, independent
contractors, and employees who were involved in, or who contributed to, the
creation or development of any Seller-Owned IP Rights, of the rights to such
contributions that may be owned by such persons or that Seller does not
already own by operation of law.

 

  

 

(s) To the Knowledge of Seller, no current or former employee, consultant or
independent contractor of Seller is in material violation of any term or
covenant of any contract relating to patent disclosure, invention disclosure,
invention assignment, non-disclosure or non-competition or any other contract
with any other party by virtue of such employee's, consultant's or independent
contractor's being employed by, or performing services for, Seller or using
trade secrets or proprietary information of others without permission. To the
Knowledge of Seller, no current or former employee, consultant or independent
contractor of Seller has developed any technology, software or other
copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for Seller that is
subject to any agreement under which such employee, consultant or independent

  
 

 

 

 

 

15  

  
 

  
contractor has assigned or otherwise granted to any third party any
Intellectual Property rights in or to such technology, software or other
copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work.

 

  

 

(t) To the Seller's Knowledge, the employment of any employee of Seller or the
use by Seller of the services of any consultant or independent contractor does
not subject Seller to any liability to any third party for improperly
soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor to work for
Seller.

 

  

 

(u) Seller has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect and preserve the
confidentiality of all material confidential or non-public information that it
intends to maintain as confidential and that is included in the Seller IP
Rights ("Confidential Information"). Without limiting the foregoing, Seller
has a policy requiring all employees and consultants of Seller having access
to Confidential Information of any of its respective customers or business
partners to execute and deliver to Seller an agreement regarding the
protection of such Confidential Information or proprietary information (in the
case of proprietary information of Seller's customers and business partners,
to the extent required by such customers and business partners).

 

  

 

(v) All Seller Products sold, licensed, leased or delivered by Seller to
customers and all services provided by or through Seller to customers on or
prior to the Closing Date conform in all material respects to applicable
contractual commitments including service level commitments and express
warranties (to the extent not subject to legally effective express exclusions
thereof), and conform in all material respects to all packaging, advertising
and marketing materials and to applicable product or service specifications or
documentation. Seller does not have any liability for replacement or repair
thereof or other damages in connection therewith.

 

  

 

(w) Seller's privacy policies comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), and with any contractual
obligations relating to the use, collection, storage, disclosure, processing
and transfer of any personally identifiable information collected or obtained
by Seller or by third parties having authorized access to the records of
Seller. To the Knowledge of Seller, Seller has not experienced any material
breach of security or other unauthorized access by third parties to the
Confidential Information, including personally identifiable information in
Seller's possession, custody or control. Seller has not received any complaint
regarding Seller's use, collection, storage, disclosure, processing and
transfer of personally identifiable information.

2.12, Seller has good and marketable title to or a valid leasehold interest
in all assets necessary for the operation of its business as currently
conducted, free and clear of all Liens. All of the machinery, equipment and
other tangible personal property and assets owned or used by Seller and
necessary for the operation of its business as currently conducted are in good
condition and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, and are usable in the

Seller's Knowledge, any other "disqualified person" (within the meaning of
Code §4975) or any "party in

  
 

 

 

20

 

   

  
 

  
interest" (within the meaning of ERISA §3(14)) has engaged in any non-exempt
Prohibited Transactions with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan that is
subject to tax or penalty imposed by either Code §4975 or ERISA §502(i). No
Fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan has any liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan.
No action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation with respect to the
administration or the investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to Seller's
Knowledge, threatened. Neither Seller nor the directors and officers (and
employees with responsibility for employee benefits matters) of Seller has any
Knowledge of any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or

commitment, whether legally binding or not, to establish any new Employee
Benefit Plan, or to modify or to terminate any Employee Benefit Plan (except

intention to do any of the foregoing been communicated to any employee of
Seller or any ERISA Affiliate.

 

  

 

(vii) None of the Employee Benefit Plans is subject to the requirements of
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither Seller
nor any ERISA Affiliate is or ever has been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan, nor has Seller or any ERISA Affiliate incurred any
liability (including withdrawal liability as defined in ERISA §4201) under or

contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability

benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA §3(35)). No asset of Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate is subject to any Lien under ERISA or the Code.

ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Sections 4980B or 4980D of
the Code.

an obligation to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to, any

insurance or other welfare-type benefits for current or future retired or
terminated directors, officers or employees (or any spouse

  
 

 

 

 

 

21  

  
 

  
or other dependent thereof) of Seller or of any other Person other than in
accordance with COBRA (and any similar state statute or foreign law with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is in a "group health plan" (as
defined in Section 5000(b)(i) of the Code or any similar state statute or
foreign law)).

by tax law changes, the vesting of accrued benefits under any Employee Benefit
Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code as a result of
termination of that plan or as disclosed on Schedule 2.16(c), the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not: (i)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of
compensation due to any employee, officer, former employee or former officer
of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate; or (ii) result in the triggering or
imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the right of Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate or the Buyer to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.
No amount that will be received (whether in cash or property or vesting of
property), or benefit provided to, any officer, director or employee of Seller
or any ERISA Affiliate who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or
termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or benefit plan
currently in effect as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and no such person is entitled to receive any
additional payment from Seller or any ERISA Affiliate in the event that the
excise tax of Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such person.

 

  

 

(d) Schedule 2.16(d) lists each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

December 31, 2008, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of (A)
Code Section 409A or (B) guidance issued by the IRS thereunder (including IRS

tax set forth under Code §409A(a)(1)(B).

legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, subject,
however, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,

to or affecting creditors' rights and to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in equity or at law;
(b) neither Seller nor, to Seller's Knowledge, any other party to the Lease is
in material breach or default under such Lease, and to Seller's Knowledge, no
event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the delivery of notice,
the passage of time or both, would constitute such a material breach or
default, or permit the termination, modification or acceleration of rent under
such Lease; (c) Seller has not subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any
Person the right to use or occupy such Leased Real Property or any portion
thereof; (d) Seller's possession and quiet enjoyment of the Leased Real

whether liquidated or unliquidated, and whether due or to become due) for
replacement or repair thereof or other damages in connection therewith. All of
the products manufactured, sold, leased, and delivered by Seller are subject

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER AND MERGERCO

 

 

 

Buyer (for purposes of this Article III, any reference to Buyer shall include
Buyer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis except where the context
indicates otherwise) represents and warrants to Seller that:

 

 

3.1 Organization and Qualifications. Each of Buyer and MergerCo is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and
authority: (a) to carry on its business as currently conducted; and (b) to own
and use the properties owned and used by it. Buyer and MergerCo are each duly
qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of their respective businesses or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case
may be, would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" means
any Effect that, individually, or together with any other Effect, has or would
be reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, results of operations or financial performance of Buyer
or on the ability of Buyer or MergerCo to consummate timely the transactions
contemplated hereby.

hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer
and MergerCo, and no further action is required by Buyer and MergerCo. This
Agreement has been duly executed by Buyer and MergerCo and this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Buyer and MergerCo enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject, however, as to
enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

25  

  
 

 

  
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in equity or at law.
Neither Buyer nor MergerCo is in violation of any of the provisions of their
respective Certificates of Incorporation, Bylaws or other organizational
documents.

 

 

 

3.3 No Breach. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the
Buyer and MergerCo do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement do not, conflict with, or result in any
material violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation, or result in the creation of any Liens upon
any of the properties or assets of Buyer or MergerCo, pursuant to any
provision of: (a) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Buyer or
MergerCo or any provision of the comparable organizational documents of Buyer
or MergerCo; (b) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, lease, license or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise or license applicable to Buyer or MergerCo or their
respective properties or assets; or (c) subject to the governmental filings
and other matters referred to in Section 3.4, any material constitution,
statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to Buyer
or MergerCo or their respective properties or assets.

 

 

 

3.4 Consents and Approvals. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required by or with respect to Buyer or MergerCo in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and MergerCo or the
consummation by Buyer and MergerCo of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for (a) the filing of a premerger notification and report
form by Buyer or MergerCo under the HSR Act, if applicable, and other filings
as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws, (b) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger as contemplated by Section 1.1 and (c) such approvals
as may be required under applicable federal, state or foreign securities
laws.

 

 

 

3.5 Litigation; Proceedings. There is no action, suit or proceeding,
governmental or otherwise, pending or, to Buyer's knowledge, overtly
threatened against Buyer, any of its subsidiaries (including MergerCo) or any
of their respective properties or business that questions the validity of this
Agreement, or the right of Buyer or MergerCo to enter into this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

3.6 Financial Ability. Buyer has cash or has existing borrowing facilities or
unconditional, binding firm commitments that are sufficient to enable it to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

3.7 Brokers, Finders or Financial Advisors. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person, other than Goldman Sachs, is entitled to
any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission from Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or MergerCo.

issue, cause or permit the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

4.6 Notice of Breach; Disclosure; Updating of Schedules.

 

 

(a) Each party shall promptly notify the other of (i) any event, condition or
circumstance of which such party becomes aware occurring from the date hereof
to the Closing Date that would constitute a violation or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement such that, if the same
were to continue to exist as of the Closing Date, would constitute the non-
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article VI or VII, as the
case may be, or (ii) any event, occurrence, transaction, or other item of
which such party becomes aware which would have been required to have been
disclosed on any schedule or statement delivered hereunder had such event,
occurrence, transaction or item existed as of the date hereof such that, if
the same were to continue to exist as of the Closing Date, would constitute
the non-satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article VI or VII,
as the case may be. The failure of one party to notify the other of any event,
condition or circumstances required to be disclosed pursuant to this Section
4.6(a) shall not constitute a material breach of a covenant for purposes of
Section 6.2 or 7.2, as applicable, unless such failure of a representation and
warranty to be true results in the condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 7.1,
as applicable, to not be satisfied. No such disclosure shall in any way be
deemed to amend, modify, or in any way affect the representations, warranties,
and covenants made by any party in or pursuant to this Agreement or be deemed
to constitute a waiver of any condition in favor of any party hereto.

 

 

(b) Seller may update Disclosure Schedules during the Pre-Closing Period to
reflect the occurrence of any event referred to in Section 4.6(a)(i) and (ii)
above after the date hereof in order to make such Disclosure Schedules true
and correct as of the Closing Date.

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

30  

  
 

  
Unless waived in writing by Buyer on or before the Closing Date, no such
updated disclosure shall in any way be deemed to amend, modify, or in any way
affect the representations, warranties, and covenants made by Seller in or
pursuant to this Agreement or be deemed to constitute a waiver of any
condition in favor of any such party hereto.

 

 

4.7 Non-Solicitation, Non-Negotiation.

 

  

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller
will not directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or
knowingly facilitate (by furnishing non-public information or otherwise) any
inquiry or the making of any proposal that is or may reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or discuss or negotiate any Acquisition
Proposal with any third party; nor will Seller authorize or permit any of its
respective officers, directors, employees, bankers, attorneys, accountants, or
other representatives (regardless of whether acting or purporting to act on
behalf of Seller or otherwise) to do any of these things. For the purposes
hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" means a proposal for any tender or exchange
offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase, or similar
transaction or series of transactions involving the sale or transfer of at
least a majority of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the
assets (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business) of
Seller; but does not include the Merger or other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

  

 

(b) Seller will as promptly as practicable, but in any event within one day,
notify Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
in connection with or that might reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (including any request for information), including
the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the
material terms and conditions thereof.

 

 

4.8 Notices. Seller shall give all notices and other information required to
be given to the employees of Seller, any collective bargaining unit
representing any group of employees of Seller, and any applicable government
authority under the WARN Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Code, the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, and other applicable law in
connection with the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

 

 

4.9 Preparation of Returns and Payment of Taxes. Seller shall prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns and any amendments thereto required to be filed by
it on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity
to review prior to filing all of Seller's income Tax Returns and amendments.
Seller and its subsidiaries shall pay and discharge all Taxes, assessments and
governmental charges upon or against it or any of its properties or assets,
and all liabilities at any time existing, before the same shall become
delinquent and before penalties accrue thereon, except to the extent and so
long as: (a) the same are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings pursued diligently and in such a manner as not to cause any
material adverse effect upon the condition (financial or otherwise) or
operations of Seller; and (b) Seller shall have set aside on its books
reserves (segregated to the extent required by sound accounting practice) in
the amount of the demanded principal imposition (together with interest and
penalties relating thereto, if any).

reasonably request. Seller agrees to provide to Buyer and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial statements
promptly upon request.

 

  

 

(b) Subject to Section 8.2(d), no information or knowledge obtained in any

5.3 Employee Matters.

 

  

 

(a) Obligations of Buyer; Comparability of Benefits. Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable best efforts to
assume all Employee Benefit Plans and other employment-related obligations
and agreements with respect to any current or former employees of Seller
("Seller Employees"), provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude
the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying, suspending or
terminating any or all Employee Benefit Plans or other employment-related
obligations or agreements with respect to any Seller Employees in its
discretion at any time, provided, further, that prior to December 31, 2011,
such amendment, modification, suspension or termination shall not materially
reduce in the aggregate the benefits provided to Seller Employees as of the
Effective Time.

 

  

 

(b) Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit. With respect to any Employee
Benefit Plans of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates
in which Seller Employees

  
 

 

 

 

 

32  

  
 

participate after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or such affiliates to: (i) waive all limitations as to
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to

service of Seller Employees with Seller and its current and former affiliates
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, form of payment and
calculation of the rate of benefits (if applicable) relating to service after
the Effective Time, but not (A) to the extent such recognition would result in
duplication of benefits or (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or equity plan, and only to the same extent such
service would be taken into account under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

  

 

5.4 Consents; Cooperation.

 

  

 

(a) Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek, and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals
required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including those required under the HSR Act
and any foreign antitrust laws, including submitting any such required filings
or other request for approvals related to Antitrust Laws (as defined in 5.4(b)
below) no later than four (4) business days after execution of this Agreement.
The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other antitrust or
fair trade law.

 

  

 

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any governmental entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith,
if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent (each an "Order"), that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, unless by mutual agreement Buyer and Seller decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is expressly understood
and agreed that neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any obligation to litigate
or contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any Order
beyond the earlier of (i) the six-month anniversary of the date hereof or (ii)
the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Each of Buyer and Seller shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of

  
 

 

 

 

 

33  

  
 

the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to
such transactions as promptly as possible after filing the notification and
report form under the HSR Act.

 

  

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Buyer
shall not be required to divest any of its businesses, product lines or
assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any
limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect after the Closing Date or a material adverse effect on Buyer,
and (ii) Seller shall not be required to divest any of its businesses, product
lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any
limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect.

 

  

 

5.5 Exercise of Stock Options; Payment of One Time Bonus and Dividend. Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, which shall include
accelerating the vesting provisions in the Seller Stock Options if necessary,
to cause the Stockholders to exercise any and all outstanding Seller Stock
Options prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall be permitted to pay a one-time
bonus (the "One Time Bonus") to certain of its selected employees prior to
Closing out of the proceeds of the exercise of the Seller Stock Options. Prior
to the payment of the One Time Bonus, Seller shall provide written notice to
Buyer of the aggregate amount of the One Time Bonus, the intended recipients
and the individual amounts to be paid to the recipients. Seller shall cause
the One Time Bonus to be treated as compensation for accounting and tax
purposes. In the event that the proceeds of the exercise of the Stock Options
exceed the One Time Bonus (the "Stock Option Excess"), Seller may issue a
dividend to the Stockholders for any or all of the amount of such excess in
accordance with Section 4.3(c).

 

 

5.6 Director and Officer Indemnification; Insurance.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Seller
pursuant to any agreement of the Seller providing for the indemnification of
its officers or directors (the current and former officers and directors of
the Seller, and all other persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such
agreements being referred to collectively as the "Seller Indemnified
Parties"). From and after the Effective Time, except to the extent otherwise
required to comply with applicable law, Buyer shall cause the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to contain the provisions with
respect to exculpation from liability no less favorable to the beneficiaries
thereof than those set forth in the Seller's certificate of incorporation
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.6(a), during the period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless each Seller
Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (i) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Seller Indemnified Party's
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission,

 

  
 

 

 

34

 

   

  
 

or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, on or after the Closing
Date) or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Seller Indemnified Party delivers to Buyer a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.6(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i)
Buyer will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective
Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof,
Buyer will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Seller
Indemnified Parties' entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto), (ii) any counsel retained by the Seller Indemnified Parties with
respect to the defense thereof for any period after the Effective Time must be
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and (iii) after the Effective Time, Buyer
will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after
statements therefor are received (provided that in the event of a final non-
appealable judicial determination that any Seller Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder, any amounts advanced on his or her
behalf shall be remitted to the Surviving Corporation); provided, however,
that neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation, nor any Seller Indemnified
Party, will be liable for any settlement effected without its, his or her
express written consent. The Seller Indemnified Parties as a group may retain
only one law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with
respect to any single action unless counsel for any Seller Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict exists or is reasonably likely to arise on any material
issue between the positions of any two or more Seller Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer shall not settle or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification
may be sought under this Section 5.6 unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Seller
Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

 

(c) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Buyer shall cause to be maintained in effect, for the benefit of the
Seller Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage as set forth in the Seller's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

 

 

(d) This Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Seller
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

5.7 Certain Employment and Other Agreements. Buyer and certain employees of
Seller are entering into certain employment and other related agreements
concurrently with this Agreement, which agreements shall be held in escrow by
Buyer until the Closing Date, at which time they will be released and become
effective. In the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason prior
to Closing, any and all such agreements with Seller's employees shall be void
and without further force or effect.

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

35  

  
 

5.8 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will, from
time to time after the date of this Agreement, execute and deliver such other
certificates, documents and instruments and take such other action as may be
reasonably requested by any of the other parties to carry out the actions and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII.  

 

 

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

8.1 Survival.

 

 

(a) All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Seller
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, the supplements to the Disclosure
Schedule shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Merger until
the Escrow Termination Date, except that the representations and warranties in
Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.10, 2.16, 3.1 and 3.2 (the "Specified Representations")
shall survive until thirty (30) days beyond the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and no claims for breach of representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations may be brought after the Escrow
Termination Date, or with respect to the Specified Representations, thirty
(30) days beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. It
is the express intent of the parties that, if the applicable survival period
for an item as contemplated by this Section 8.1 is shorter than the statute of
limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by
contract, the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item
shall be reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby. The
parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section
8.1 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of arms-
length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time periods
to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

 

 

(b) The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon
such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be
affected by any investigation (including any environmental investigation
or assessment) conducted with respect to or any knowledge acquired at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy, inaccuracy of or compliance
with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of
any condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not
affect the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon
such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

 

 

8.2 Indemnification.

 

 

(a) After the Closing Date, the Stockholders thereafter shall indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer, MergerCo and the Surviving Corporation and each of its
respective agents, representatives, employees, officers, directors,
stockholders, controlling persons and affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees"), and shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any loss,
liability, claim, damage, expense (including, but not limited to, costs of
investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees), whether or not
involving a third-party claim (collectively, "Damages") actually paid or
suffered as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and
warranties of Seller in Article II of this Agreement or the Seller Closing
Certificate, and (ii) any failure of Seller to perform or comply with any
agreement to be performed or complied with by it in this Agreement. Each
Stockholder shall be severally, and not jointly, liable on a pro rata basis
for its respective indemnification obligations under this

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

39  

  
 

  
Section 8.2(a), which shall be determined based on the quotient obtained by
dividing the aggregate consideration payable to such Stockholder pursuant to
Section 1.7 by the aggregate Closing Date Cash Consideration (the "Pro Rata
Portion").

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled
to indemnification under this Section 8.2 until the aggregate amount of all
Damages under this Section 8.2 incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees
(collectively) exceeds $1,250,000 (the "Seller Threshold"); provided,
however, that all claims of Buyer Indemnitees under Section 8.2 shall accrue
in the aggregate until the Damages of Buyer Indemnitees exceed the Seller
Threshold, and thereupon the Buyer Indemnitees shall become entitled to be to
indemnified for only such Damages that exceed $500,000.

 

 

(c) Subject to the following sentence, but notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, recourse to the Escrow Fund
shall be the Buyer Indemnitees' sole and exclusive remedy following the
Closing for claims pursuant to Article VIII. After the funds in the Escrow
Fund have been exhausted, the Buyer Indemnitees may seek recourse directly
from the Stockholders for claims for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(i)
for Damages resulting from a failure of the Specified Representations to be
true, provided that the maximum amount the Buyer Indemnitees may recover
directly from any Stockholder for all such claims shall be limited in the
aggregate to the portion of the proceeds actually received by such
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that any amounts
held on behalf of a Stockholder in the Escrow Fund shall not be deemed to have
been "actually received" for purposes of this Section 8.2(c) unless and until
such amounts have been actually distributed to such Stockholder). Except as
otherwise provided herein, no current or former stockholder, director,
officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of the Seller shall have any personal
or individual liability of any nature to the Buyer Indemnitees with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation set
forth in, or any other breach of, this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent Buyer from bringing a common law action for actual fraud with
intent to deceive against any Person whose own such fraud has caused Buyer to
incur Damages or limit the Damages recoverable by Buyer in such common law
action, provided that no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover
more than once for the same Damages.

 

 

(d) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
Article VIII, for purposes of this Agreement, none of the representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to be or
to have been inaccurate if, during the period from the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the Effective Time, (i) the Seller
delivers written notice of the inaccuracy to Buyer or MergerCo and (ii) Buyer
and MergerCo nonetheless elect to proceed with the Closing.

 

 

(e) The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII shall be calculated net of: (i) any tax benefit received or
receivable by the Buyer Indemnitees in connection with such Damages or any of
the events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Damages;
and (ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements received or receivable by the Buyer
Indemnitees in connection with such Damages or any of the events or
circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Damages. The Buyer
Indemnitees shall seek full

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

40  

  
 

  
recovery under all insurance policies covering any Damages to the same extent
as they would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 

 

(f) To the extent the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this Article VIII, the Stockholders' Agent shall be entitled to
exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including
rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery)
that the Buyer Indemnitees may have against any other Person with respect to
any Damages, circumstances or matter to which such indemnification payment is
directly or indirectly related. The Buyer Indemnitees shall permit the
Stockholders' Agent to use the name of any of the Buyer Indemnitees in any
transaction or in any action or proceeding or other matter involving any of
such rights or remedies, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall take such actions as
the Stockholders' Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling
the Stockholders' Agent to perfect or exercise the right of subrogation of the
Stockholders' Agent hereunder.

 

 

(g) Promptly after any of the Buyer Indemnitees becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute or give rise to
any indemnification claim by a Buyer Indemnitee under this Article VIII, such
Buyer Indemnitee shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate and
minimize all Damages that may result from such event or circumstance.

 

 

8.3 Indemnification Payment.

 

 

(a) Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.3
unless it has duly delivered a written notice to the Stockholders' Agent and
the Escrow Agent (any such notice being referred to as a "Notice of
Indemnification Claim," and the claim for indemnification described in such
Notice of Indemnification Claim being referred to as an "indemnification
claim"), setting forth: (i) the specific representation and warranty alleged
to have been breached by the Company; (ii) a detailed description of the facts
and circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach of such representation and
warranty; and (iii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Damages being claimed
with respect to the breach referred to in such notice (the aggregate amount
of such estimate being referred to as the "Claimed Amount").

 

 

(b) During the 45-day period commencing upon the receipt by the Stockholders'
Agent of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the Stockholders' Agent shall
deliver to Buyer and the Escrow Agent a written response (the "Response
Notice") in which the Stockholders' Agent: (i) agrees that the full Claimed
Amount is owed to Buyer; (ii) agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed
Amount (the "Agreed Amount") is owed to Buyer; or (iii) asserts that no part
of the Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is
not agreed by the Stockholders' Agent to be owed to Buyer pursuant to the
Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Stockholders' Agent
asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to
Buyer) shall be referred to as the "Contested Amount." If the Stockholders'
Agent does not deliver a Response Notice within the aforementioned 45-day
period, it shall be deemed to have submitted a Response Notice in which the
Agreed Amount was equal to the Claimed Amount.

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

(c) If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice to Buyer agreeing
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer, then, within three days
following the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer, Buyer and the
Stockholders' Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full Claimed Amount
(or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the
Escrow Fund.

 

 

(d) If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice to Buyer agreeing
that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer, then, within three
days following the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer, Buyer and the
Stockholders' Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Agreed Amount (or
such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the Escrow
Fund.

 

 

(e) If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice to Buyer indicating
that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders' Agent and Buyer shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount.
If Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent resolve such dispute in writing, then a
settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to Buyer (the "Stipulated
Amount") shall be signed by Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent. Within three
days after the execution of such settlement agreement, Buyer and the
Stockholders' Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Stipulated Amount
(or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer from the
Escrow Fund.

 

 

(f) If the Stockholders' Agent and Buyer are unable to resolve the dispute
relating to any Contested Amount during the 30-day period commencing upon the
receipt of the Response Notice by Buyer, then either Buyer or the
Stockholders' Agent may submit the contested portion of the indemnification
claim to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 8.3. The final
decision of the arbitrator shall include the dollar amount of the award to
Buyer, if any (the "Award Amount"), and shall be furnished to the
Stockholders' Agent and Buyer in writing. Within three days following the
receipt of the final award of the arbitrator setting forth the Award Amount,
Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent shall jointly execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
Award Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Buyer
from the Escrow Fund.

 

 

(g) If the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund as of the Escrow
Termination Date (the "Aggregate Escrow Balance") exceeds the aggregate dollar
amount, as of the Escrow Termination Date, of (i) the Contested Amounts
associated with all indemnification claims that have not been finally
resolved and paid prior to the Termination Date in accordance with this
Section 8.3, and (ii) any Claimed Amounts for which Stockholders' Agent has
not yet delivered a Response Notice (each, an "Unresolved Escrow Claim," and
the aggregate dollar amount of such Contested Amounts as of the Escrow
Termination Date being referred to as the "Aggregate Pending Claim Amount"),
then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Fund, either (x) the
Aggregate Distribution Amount to the Paying Agent, or (y) to each
Participant, an amount determined by multiplying such Participant's Pro Rata
Portion by the Aggregate Distribution Amount, as shall be determined by Buyer
and Stockholders' Agent. For

 

 

 

 

 

 

42

 

   

 

 

 

  
purposes of this Section 8.3(g), the "Aggregate Distribution Amount" shall be
the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of the Termination Date minus the Aggregate
Pending Claim Amount.

 

 

(h) Following the Escrow Termination Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is
finally resolved, Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent shall jointly execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days after the final resolution of
such Unresolved Escrow Claim, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent
to release from the Escrow Fund, either (i) the Excess Escrow Amount to the
Paying Agent, or (ii) to each Participant an amount determined by multiplying
such Participant's Pro Rata Portion by the Excess Escrow Amount, as shall be
determined by Buyer and Stockholders' Agent. For purposes of this Section
8.3(h), the "Excess Escrow Amount" shall mean the amount (if any) by which
the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund as of the date of resolution
of such Unresolved Escrow Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the Contested
Amounts associated with all other remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims.

 

 

(i) The parties agree that any amounts released to Buyer from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be treated as a reduction in the aggregate
consideration paid in connection with the Merger for all income tax purposes.

 

 

8.4 Procedure for Indemnification--Third Party Claims. The Buyer shall with
reasonable promptness give to the Stockholders' Agent written notice if it or
any of the other Buyer Indemnitees becomes aware of any liability, loss,
damage, claim, cost and expense with respect to which indemnity under Section
8.2 may be asserted. If any claim is made by a third person or an action or
proceeding commenced for which the any of the Buyer Indemnitees shall seek
indemnity from the Stockholders, Buyer party shall give to the Stockholders'
Agent prompt written notice of the claim stating the nature and basis of such
claim and, to the extent known, the amount of and remedy sought by such third
person, and request the Stockholders' Agent, on behalf of the Stockholders,
to defend the same; provided, that the failure of the Buyer to deliver prompt
written notice shall not result in any liability on the part of the Buyer (or
result in the reduction of any right to indemnification) except to the extent
of actual prejudice which results from such failure. The Stockholders' Agent
shall have the right to defend against such liability at its expense, and
shall give written notice to the Buyer of the commencement of such defense
with reasonable promptness after the giving of the written notice of the claim
by the Buyer. The Buyer shall be entitled to participate with the
Stockholders' Agent in such defense (at the Buyer's expense except with
respect to defenses which are not available to the Stockholders' Agent), but
shall not be entitled in any way to release, waive, settle, modify or pay such
claim without the written consent of the Stockholders' Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if the Stockholders'
Agent has assumed such defense. In the event the Stockholders' Agent does not
accept the defense of the matter as provided above, or does not notify the
Buyer of its election to defend such a matter within 30 days after written
notice from the Buyer, the Buyer shall have the full right to defend against
such liability and consent to the entry of any judgment or settlement of the
matter in such manner as it may deem appropriate. In the event the
Stockholders' Agent shall assume the defense, the Buyer shall cooperate in the
defense of such action, and the records of the Buyer shall be available to the
Stockholders' Agent with respect to such defense, provided, however, that the
Stockholders' Agent shall not, in the defense of any such action, consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement where such entry of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

  
judgment or settlement does not include a provision releasing the Buyer
Indemnitees from all liability with respect to such action, except with the
written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except with the consent
of the Stockholders' Agent, no consent or settlement of any third party claim
shall be determinative of the amount of Damages relating to such claim.

 

 

8.5 Stockholders' Agent.

 

  

 

(a) Pete Chung shall be constituted and appointed as agent ("Stockholders'
Agent") for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Buyer of the cash or other property
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Buyer, to object to such
deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, to consent or agree to any amendment
to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment
of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent
of any other Person. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority
in interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon not less than ten days'
prior written notice to Buyer. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders'
Agent, [and the Stockholders' Agent shall receive no compensation for his
services]. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders' Agent shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders.

 

  

 

(b) The Stockholders' Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Stockholders' Agent while acting in good faith, without gross
negligence and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith. The Stockholders shall severally (on a pro rata basis according to
their respective interests in the Escrow Fund) indemnify the Stockholders'
Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders' Agent
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
his duties hereunder.

 

  

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Stockholders' Agent with reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the officers and employees of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation for purposes
of performing his duties and exercising his rights under this Agreement,
provided that the Stockholders' Agent shall treat confidentially any nonpublic
information he receives from Buyer regarding the Surviving Corporation (except
in connection with the performance by the Stockholders' Agent of his duties or
the exercise of his rights under this Agreement).

 

  

 

8.6 Actions of the Stockholders' Agent. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all

The Escrow Agent may employ such counsel, accountants, engineers, appraisers,
other experts, agents, agencies and advisors as it may reasonably require for

hereunder. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(c)

liable for refusing to act unless it has received clear and reasonable
documentation which complies with the terms of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(d)

 |  

No provision of this Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance
of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights or powers unless
indemnified as provided for herein, other than as a result of its own gross
negligence or bad faith. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(e)

 |  

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any act

The forwarding of a check by the Escrow Agent will satisfy and discharge the
liability for any cash amounts due to the extent of the sum or sums
represented thereby (plus the amount of any tax deducted or withheld as
required by law) unless such check is not honored on presentation; provided
that in the event of non-receipt of such check by the payee, or loss or
destruction thereof, the Escrow Agent upon being furnished with reasonable
evidence of such non-receipt, loss or destruction and indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to it, will issue to such payee a replacement check for the
amount of such check. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(h)

 |  

The Buyer shall pay the costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent\'s services
hereunder, and the costs and expense reasonably incurred by the Escrow Agent
in connection with the administration of the escrow created hereby or the
performance or observance of its duties hereunder which are in excess of its
compensation for normal services hereunder and covered by the remuneration,
including without limitation, all out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements
incurred or made by the Escrow Agent in the administration of its services and
duties created hereby (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its
outside counsel and other outside advisors required for discharge of its
duties hereunder). Any amount owing under this Section and unpaid thirty (30)
days after request for such payment will bear interest from the expiration of
such thirty (30) days at a rate per annum equal to the then current rate
charged by the Escrow Agent, payable on demand. If payment is not received
when due, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to draw down on the Escrow Amount
in order to effect such payment and may sell, liquidate, convey or otherwise
dispose of any investment for such purpose. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(i)

 |  

The Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent shall jointly and severally indemnify
the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates,
successors and assigns and hold it and them harmless from and against any
loss, fee, claim, demand, penalty, liability, damage, cost and expense of any
nature incurred by the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, affiliates, successors and assigns arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or with the administration of its duties hereunder,
including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees and other costs and
expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim of liability,
unless and except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost and expense
shall be caused by the Escrow Agent\'s or its officers', directors',
employees', agents', affiliates', successors' or assigns' gross negligence or
bad faith. Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees, agents,
affiliates, successors and assigns shall not be liable for any incidental,
indirect, special or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever,
including, but not limited to, loss of anticipated profits, occasioned by a
breach of any provision of this Agreement even if 

---|--- 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

  

 

 

    

 |  

apprised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing indemnification and
agreement to hold harmless shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

  

 

 

    

(j)

 |  

The Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Amount but is
serving as escrow agent only and having only possession thereof. This Section
7 shall survive notwithstanding any termination of the Agreement or the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(k)

 |  

The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those which are expressly set
forth herein, and it shall not be bound by any notice of a claim or demand
with respect to, or any waiver, modification, amendment, termination or
rescission of this Agreement, unless received by it in writing, and signed by
the parties hereto and if its duties herein are affected, unless it shall
have given its prior written consent thereto. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(l)

 |  

The Escrow Agent accepts the duties and responsibilities under this Agreement
as agent, and no trust is intended to be, or is or will be, created hereby and

document, including the representative capacity in which a party purports to
act, that the Escrow Agent receives as a condition to a release from escrow
under this Agreement.

8. Resignation of Escrow Agent; Successor by Merger

 

 

    

(a)

 |  

Resignation and delivery. The Escrow Agent may at any time resign as such,
subject to this Section 8, by delivering written notice of resignation to the
other parties to this Agreement and by delivering the Escrow Amount (less any
portion thereof previously distributed in accordance with this Agreement) to
any successor escrow agent designated by the Buyer and the Stockholders'
Agent, or by a court of competent jurisdiction, whereupon the Escrow Agent
shall be discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in
connection with this Agreement. The resignation of the Escrow Agent will take
effect on the earlier to occur of (the "Resignation Date"): (i) the
appointment of a successor escrow agent as aforesaid or by a court of
competent jurisdiction; or (ii) the day which is 30 days after the date of
delivery of the Escrow Agent\'s written notice of resignation to the other
parties hereto, or such shorter notice as the parties accept as sufficient. If
the Escrow Agent has not received written notice of the designation of a
successor escrow agent by the Resignation Date, the Escrow Agent\'s sole
responsibility after such time shall be to 

---|--- 

 

  

 

 

 

 

7

 

   

 

  

 

    

 |  

retain and safeguard the Escrow Amount until receipt of written notice of the
designation of a successor escrow agent hereunder or pursuant to a final non-
appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If a successor escrow
agent has not been appointed within 90 days of the date of the delivery of its
written notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow
Amount (less any portion thereof previously distributed in accordance with
this Agreement) to the legal counsel designated by the Buyer and the
Stockholders' Agent and all of the Escrow Agent\'s duties and obligations
under this Agreement shall thereupon cease immediately. Failing such
designation by the Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver such Escrow Amount to [ ] whereupon this Agreement shall terminate
and the Escrow Agent shall have no further duties and obligations under this
Agreement. Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent, acting together, shall have
power at any time to remove the existing Escrow Agent and to appoint a
successor escrow agent. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(b)

 |  

Deduction of Fees. If the Escrow Agent resigns or is removed pursuant to this
Section 8, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled, prior to delivery to any party
of the Escrow Amount, to deduct any amounts owing to it in respect to
outstanding and unpaid fees, disbursements and interest thereon whereupon this
Agreement shall terminate and the Escrow Agent shall have no further duties
and obligations under this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 

 

 

    

(c)

 |  

Incapacity of Escrow Agent. In the event of the Escrow Agent resigning or
being removed as aforesaid or being dissolved, becoming bankrupt, going into
liquidation or otherwise becoming incapable of acting hereunder, the Buyer and
the Stockholders' Agent acting together, shall forthwith appoint a successor
escrow agent; failing such appointment by the Buyer and the Stockholders'
Agent, the retiring Escrow Agent, acting alone, may apply, at the expense of
the Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent, to a court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor escrow agent; but any successor escrow
agent so appointed by the Court shall be subject to removal as aforesaid by
the Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent, acting together. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(d)

 |  

Transfer and Delivery; Fees. At the request of the Buyer and the Stockholders'
Agent or the successor escrow agent, the retiring Escrow Agent, upon payment
of the amounts, if any, due to it pursuant to this Agreement, including any
amounts owing to it in respect to outstanding and unpaid fees, disbursements
and interest thereon, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to the successor
escrow agent all property and money held, and all records kept, by the
retiring Escrow Agent hereunder or in connection herewith. 

---|--- 

 

 

    (e)  |  

Succession. Any corporation into or with which the Escrow Agent may 

---|--- 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

  

 

     |  

be merged or consolidated or amalgamated, or any corporation resulting
therefrom to which the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any corporation
succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Escrow Agent shall be the successor to the Escrow Agent hereunder without any
further act on its part or any of the parties hereto, provided that such
corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor escrow agent
hereunder. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

 |  

9.

 |  

Tax Reporting. The Buyer and the Stockholders' Agent agree to provide all
necessary and appropriate tax information and documentation required by the
Escrow Agent or applicable taxing authorities in a timely manner as to
facilitate proper tax reporting hereunder. Consistent with applicable law, the
sole obligation of the Escrow Agent with regard to tax reporting under this
Section 13 shall be to the report amounts released from the Escrow Amount on
the appropriate IRS form or forms. 

---|---|--- 

 

 

    

10\.

 |  

Anti-Money Laundering. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(a)

 |  

Each Party to this Agreement (other than the Escrow Agent) hereby represents
to the Escrow Agent that any account to be opened by, or interest to be held
by, the Escrow Agent in connection with this Agreement, for or to the credit
of such Party, either (i) is not intended to be used by or on behalf of any
third party; or (ii) is intended to be used by or on behalf of a third party,
in which case such Party hereto agrees to complete and execute forthwith a
declaration in the Escrow Agent\'s prescribed form as to the particulars of
such third party. 

---|--- 

 

 

    

(b)

 |  

The Escrow Agent shall retain the right not to act and shall not be liable for
refusing to act if, due to a lack of information or for any other reason
whatsoever, the Escrow Agent, in its sole judgment, determines that such act
might cause it to be in non-compliance with any applicable anti-money
laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation or guideline. Further,
should the Escrow Agent, in its sole judgment, determine at any time that its
acting under this Agreement has resulted in its being in non-compliance with
any applicable anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation
or guideline, then it shall have the right to resign on ten (10) days written
notice to the other parties to this Agreement, provided (i) that the Escrow
Agent\'s written notice shall describe the circumstances of such non-
compliance; and (ii) that if such circumstances are rectified to the Escrow
Agent\'s satisfaction within such ten (10) day period, then such resignation
shall not be effective. 

---|--- 

 

 

11. Privacy.

 

 

    (a)  |  

Definition. Each party acknowledges and understands that any and all
technical, trade secret, or business information, including, without
limitation, financial information, business or marketing strategies or 

---|--- 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

  

 

     |  

plans, product development, Buyer or Stockholders' Agent information,
(including any non-public information of such Buyer or Stockholders' Agent),
proprietary information, or proprietary software (including methods or
concepts used therein, sources code, object code, or related technical
information) which has been or is disclosed to the other or has been or is
otherwise obtained by the other, its affiliates, agents or representatives
before or during the term of this Agreement (the "Confidential Information")
is confidential and proprietary, constitutes trade secrets of the owner (or
its affiliates), and is of great value and importance to the success of the
owner's (or its affiliates') business. The parties shall treat the terms and
conditions (but not the existence) of this Agreement as the Confidential
Information of the other party. Confidential Information shall not include
any information that is: (i) already known to the other party or its
affiliates at the time of the disclosure; (ii) publicly known at the time of
the disclosure or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or failure of
the other party; (iii) subsequently disclosed to the other party or its
affiliates on a non-confidential basis by a third party not having a
confidential relationship with the owner and which rightfully acquired
such information; or (iv) independently developed by one party without access
to the Confidential Information of the other.

  

---|--- 

 

    (b)  |  

Use and Disclosure. All Confidential Information relating to a party will be
held in confidence by the other party to the same extent and with at least the
same degree of care as such party protects its own confidential or
proprietary information of like kind and import, but in no event using less
than a reasonable degree of care. Neither party will disclose, duplicate,
publish, release, transfer or otherwise make available Confidential
Information of the other party in any form to, or for the use or benefit of,
any person or entity without the other party\'s consent. Each party will,
however, be permitted to disclose relevant aspects of the other party\'s
Confidential Information to its officers, affiliates, agents, subcontractors
and employees to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for
the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and such
disclosure is not prohibited by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (15 U.S.C.
6801 et seq.), as it may be amended from time to time (the "GLB Act"), the
regulations promulgated thereunder or other applicable law. Each party will
establish commercially reasonable controls to ensure the confidentiality of
the Confidential Information and to ensure that the Confidential Information
is not disclosed contrary to the provisions of this Agreement, the GLB Act or
any other applicable privacy law. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
will implement such physical and other security measures as are necessary to
(i) ensure the security and confidentiality of the Confidential Information;
(ii) protect against any threats or hazards to the security and integrity of
the Confidential Information; and (iii) protect against any unauthorized
access to or use of the Confidential Information. To the 

---|--- 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

  

 

     |  

extent that any duties and responsibilities under this Agreement are delegated
to an agent or other subcontractor, the party ensures that such agent and
subcontractor are contractually bound to confidentiality terms consistent with
the terms of this Section 11.

  

---|--- 

 

    (c)  |  

Required or Permitted Disclosure. In the event that any requests or demands
are made for the disclosure of Confidential Information, the party receiving
such request will notify the other party to secure instructions from an
authorized officer of such party as to such request and to enable the other
party the opportunity to obtain a protective order or other confidential
treatment, unless such notification is otherwise prohibited by law or court
order. Each party expressly reserves the right, however, to disclose
Confidential Information to any person whenever it is advised by counsel that
it may be held liable for the failure to disclose such Confidential
Information or if required by law or court order. 

---|--- 

 

  

 

    (d)  |  

Unauthorized Disclosure. As may be required by law and without limiting either
party\'s rights in respect of a breach of this Section, each party will (i)
promptly notify the other party in writing of any unauthorized possession,
use or disclosure of the other party\'s Confidential Information by any person
or entity that may become known to such party; (ii) promptly furnish to the
other party full details of the unauthorized possession, use or disclosure;
and (iii) promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent a recurrence
of any such unauthorized possession, use or disclosure of Confidential
Information. 

---|--- 

 

  

 

    (e)  |  

Costs. Each party will bear the costs it incurs as a result of compliance with
this Section 11.
