Agreement provides that the directors of Pacific Premier immediately after
the Bank Merger shall be the directors of Pacific Premier immediately prior to

PROCEDURES 3.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of a holder of shares of HEOP
Common Stock: (a) PPBI Common Stock. Each share of PPBI Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger. (b) HEOP Common
Stock. Subject to Sections 3.02, 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07, each share of HEOP
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any shares that were issued as restricted stock and for which the
vesting conditions have been satisfied) shall be converted into, and shall be
canceled in exchange for, the right to receive 0.3471 shares of PPBI Common
Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"). 3.02 Exchange Procedures. (a) Mailing of
Transmittal Material. Provided that HEOP has delivered, or caused to be
delivered, to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "Exchange Agent")
all information which is reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to
perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall,
promptly following the Effective Date (but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Date), mail and otherwise make available to
each holder of record of HEOP Common Stock, a notice and a form of letter of
transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to HEOP (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s)
theretofore representing shares of HEOP Common Stock shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent or transfer of
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent), advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre016.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 12 Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section
3.01(b) hereof. A letter of transmittal will be properly completed only if
accompanied by Certificate or Certificates or instructions to transfer Book-
Entry Shares representing all shares of HEOP Common Stock covered thereby,
subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section 3.02. (b) PPBI
Deliveries. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, PPBI shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent certificates, or at PPBI's option, evidence of shares in book entry
form, representing the number of shares of PPBI Common Stock issuable to the
holders of HEOP Common Stock as the Merger Consideration, to be given to the
holders of HEOP Common Stock in exchange for their Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares as provided for in this Article III. The Exchange Agent shall
not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to
the shares of PPBI Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder,
except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions
paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the
Persons entitled thereto. (c) Exchange Agent Deliveries. (i) Each holder of
an outstanding Certificate or Certificates or Book- Entry Shares who has
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon
acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to evidence of issuance
in book entry form, or upon written request of such holder, a certificate or
certificates representing, the number of whole shares of PPBI Common Stock
into which the aggregate number of shares of HEOP Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any other
distribution theretofore paid with respect to PPBI Common Stock issuable in
the Merger, in each case, without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose consistent with the
notice and form of letter of transmittal to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. (ii) Each outstanding
Certificate or Book-Entry Share which prior to the Effective Time represented
HEOP Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise
herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to
evidence ownership of the number of shares of PPBI Common Stock into which
such HEOP Common Stock shall have been converted. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further transfer on the records of HEOP of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing shares of HEOP Common Stock and, if such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to HEOP for transfer, they
shall be cancelled against delivery of certificates for PPBI Common Stock as
hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared will be remitted
to any Person entitled to receive shares of PPBI Common Stock under Section
3.01 until such Person surrenders the Certificate or Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares representing HEOP Common Stock, at which time such dividends
shall be remitted to such Person, without interest.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre017.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 13 (d) Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of PPBI Common
Stock in New Names. The Exchange Agent and PPBI, as the case may be, shall
not be obligated to deliver a certificate or certificates representing shares
of PPBI Common Stock to which a holder of HEOP Common Stock would otherwise
be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of HEOP Common Stock for
exchange as provided in this Section 3.02, or, in default thereof, an
appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an
amount as may be reasonably required in each case by PPBI. If any
certificates evidencing shares of PPBI Common Stock are to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate evidencing HEOP Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of PPBI Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. (e) Unclaimed Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the shares of PPBI Common Stock delivered to
the Exchange Agent by PPBI pursuant to Section 3.02(b) that remains unclaimed
by the shareholders of HEOP for six months after the Effective Time (as well
as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to PPBI. Any shareholders of HEOP who have not theretofore
complied with Section 3.02(c) shall thereafter look only to PPBI for the
consideration deliverable in respect of each share of HEOP Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any
interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are not
surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which
such shares of PPBI Common Stock would otherwise escheat to any governmental
unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by
abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of PPBI
(and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such
property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be
liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. PPBI and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of HEOP to establish the
identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in
this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive (absent manifest error) with
respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, PPBI and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with
respect to any claims thereto. 3.03 Rights as Shareholders. At the Effective
Time, holders of HEOP Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no
rights as, shareholders of HEOP other than to receive the consideration
provided for under this Article III. 3.04 No Fractional Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates
nor scrip for fractional shares of PPBI Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger. Each holder of HEOP Common Stock who otherwise would have been
entitled to a  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre018.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 14 fraction of a share of PPBI Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates or Book- Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the PPBI Average Share Price, rounded to the nearest
whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 3.05 Intentionally
Omitted. 3.06 Anti-Dilution Provisions. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the shares of PPBI Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment,
or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Merger Consideration and Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
accordingly; provided that a bona fide offering or sale of PPBI Common Stock
for fair value received shall not be deemed a reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment of
the PPBI Common Stock. 3.07 Withholding Rights. PPBI (through the Exchange
Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
of HEOP Common Stock such amounts as PPBI is required under the Code or any
state, local or foreign Tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment. In the event PPBI
reasonably determines that it is so required to deduct or withhold an amount
for or on account of any Tax from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, PPBI shall notify HEOP of its
determination and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize to the
extent permissible the amount of any such deduction or withholding, including
providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested to
establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any deduction or withholding.
Any amounts so withheld shall be timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of HEOP Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by PPBI. 3.08 HEOP Options,
HEOP Restricted Stock and HEOP Restricted Stock Units. (a) At the Effective
Time, each HEOP Option which is then outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of HEOP Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into
an option to purchase shares of PPBI Common Stock ("Converted HEOP Option"),
and PPBI shall assume each such Converted HEOP Option, in accordance with the
terms of the HEOP Stock-Based Plans and stock option or other agreement by
which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)
PPBI and the Compensation Committee of the PPBI Board shall be substituted for
HEOP and the committee of the HEOP Board (including, if applicable, the entire
HEOP Board) administering such HEOP Stock-Based Plans, (ii) each Converted
HEOP Option assumed by PPBI may be exercised solely for shares of PPBI Common
Stock, (iii) the number of shares of PPBI Common Stock subject to such
Converted HEOP Option shall be equal to the number of shares of HEOP Common
Stock subject to such HEOP Option immediately prior to the Effective  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre019.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 15 Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any
fractional shares of PPBI Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the per share exercise
price under each such Converted HEOP Option shall be adjusted by dividing the
per share exercise price under each such HEOP Option by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.
The parties hereto acknowledge that the assumption of the Converted HEOP
Options pursuant to this Section 3.08(a) is intended to comply with the
requirements of Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) of the Treasury Regulations for
not treating such assumed option as the grant of a new stock right or a change
in the form of payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. PPBI shall cause the registration of shares
of PPBI Common Stock subject to Converted HEOP Options to become effective as
part of a registration statement on Form S-8, or any successor or other
appropriate forms, with respect to the shares of PPBI Common Stock subject to
such Converted HEOP Options no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
Effective Time; and thereafter, PPBI shall deliver to holders of Converted
HEOP Options any applicable prospectus and shall maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or registration statements, including the
current status of any related prospectus, for so long as the Converted HEOP
Options remain outstanding. (b) At the Effective Time, each cash-settled
restricted stock unit issued under a HEOP Stock-Based Plan (a "HEOP
Restricted Stock Unit") which is vested and is then outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, shall be entitled to receive a single
lump sum cash payment, equal to the sum of (i) the product of (A) and (B)
where (A) equals the product of the number of HEOP Restricted Stock Units and
the Exchange Ratio and (B) equals the PPBI Average Share Price, plus (ii) any
dividends previously accrued under the HEOP Stock-Based Plans, provided that,
with respect to any fractional HEOP Restricted Stock Units remaining, each
holder of such fractional HEOP Restricted Stock Units shall receive an amount
determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled by the PPBI Average Share Price, rounded to the
nearest whole cent (the "HEOP Restricted Stock Unit Merger Consideration").
(c) At the Effective Time, each unvested cash-settled HEOP Restricted Stock
Unit which is then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing Date,
shall be converted into a right to receive cash payments based upon the value
of shares of PPBI Common Stock, and PPBI shall assume each such unvested
cash-settled HEOP Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with the terms of the
HEOP Stock-Based Plans and the restricted stock unit award or other agreement
by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)
PPBI and the Compensation Committee of the PPBI Board shall be substituted
for HEOP and the committee of the HEOP Board (including, if applicable, the
entire HEOP Board) administering such HEOP Stock-Based Plans, (ii) each
unvested cash-settled HEOP Restricted Stock Unit assumed by PPBI will
represent the right to receive cash payments based upon the value of shares
of PPBI Common Stock and (iii) the number of shares of PPBI Common Stock
referenced in each cash-settled HEOP Restricted Stock Unit shall be equal to
the number of shares of HEOP Common Stock subject to such cash-settled HEOP
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, including any fractional shares of PPBI Common Stock,
provided that for purposes of clarity, any dividends accrued under the HEOP
Stock-Based Plans with respect to cash-settled HEOP Restricted Stock Units
shall continue to be accrued and deferred until such time as the award vests
and is paid.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre020.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 16 (d) At the Effective Time, each unvested award of restricted
shares of HEOP Common Stock granted under a HEOP Stock-Based Plan (the "HEOP
Restricted Stock"), which is then outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date shall be converted into shares of PPBI Common Stock, and PPBI
shall assume each such unvested award of HEOP Restricted Stock, in accordance
with the terms of the HEOP Stock-Based Plans and restricted stock award or
other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the
Effective Time, (i) PPBI and the Compensation Committee of the PPBI Board
shall be substituted for HEOP and the committee of the HEOP Board (including,
if applicable, the entire HEOP Board) administering such HEOP Stock-Based
Plans, (ii) each unvested award of HEOP Restricted Stock assumed by PPBI will
represent shares of PPBI Common Stock and (iii) the number of shares of PPBI
Common Stock subject to each award of HEOP Restricted Stock shall be equal to
the number of shares of HEOP Common Stock subject to such award of HEOP
Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of PPBI Common Stock
shall be treated as set forth in Section 3.04. (e) The performance-based
restricted stock units issued for the performance period extending from
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, under a HEOP Stock-Based Plan (the
"HEOP Performance Restricted Stock Units") shall not be assumed by PPBI, but
rather shall become vested immediately prior to the Closing Date, and each of
the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive a single lump sum cash
payment at the Effective Time, equal to the product of (A), (B) and (C),
where (A) equals 100% of the target number of shares of HEOP Common Stock
subject to the HEOP Performance Restricted Stock Units, (B) equals the
Exchange Ratio, and (C) equals the PPBI Average Share Price. (f) Prior to
the Effective Time, HEOP may amend the HEOP Stock-Based Plans and any and all
award agreements under the HEOP Stock-Based Plans, and may take any other
action as may be necessary or appropriate, to provide (effective upon
termination of service) for the full acceleration of vesting and
exercisability of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units
held by employees, directors and other service providers of HEOP and its
Subsidiaries who either are not being retained by PPBI or its Subsidiaries
following consummation of the Transaction or whose services are terminated by
PPBI or its Subsidiaries without "Cause" (as defined in the Heritage Oaks
Bancorp 2015 Equity Incentive Plan) within one (1) year following
consummation of the Transaction. 3.09 Reservation of Shares. Prior to the
Closing, the PPBI Board shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of PPBI Common Stock (i) for the purpose of issuing its shares in
exchange for shares of HEOP Common Stock in the Merger, (ii) for the purpose
of issuing its shares upon the exercise of Converted HEOP Options, and (iii)
to convert the unvested restricted shares of HEOP Common Stock into shares of
PPBI Common Stock.

#48295864_v10 22 ARTICLE V REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 5.01 Disclosure
Schedules. On or prior to the date hereof, PPBI has delivered to HEOP a
schedule and HEOP has delivered to PPBI a schedule (each respectively, its
"Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Section
5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained in Articles IV or
VI; provided, however, that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure
Schedule, such item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. 5.02 Standard. Solely for the purposes of determining whether
the conditions set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as the case may be,

warranty made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of HEOP on
the one hand or PPBI on the other hand contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04,
respectively, other than the representations of HEOP contained in Section
5.03(b), which shall be true in all respects, except to a de minimis extent
(relative to Section 5.03(b) taken as a whole), and other than the
representations of HEOP contained in Section 5.03(m)(v), which shall be true
in all material respects, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of
Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), and no party hereto shall be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty for purposes of such Sections, as a
consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04, has had or is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making such representation or
warranty. 5.03 Representations and Warranties of HEOP. Subject to Sections

health maintenance organization, or similar organization unrelated to HEOP or
any ERISA Affiliate, the premiums for which are paid directly by HEOP or an
ERISA Affiliate thereof, from its general assets or partly from its general
assets and partly from contributions by its employees. No insurance policy or
contract relating to a Benefit Plan requires or permits a retroactive
increase to premiums or payments due thereunder. (v) Except as set forth in
Section 5.03(m)(v)(a) of HEOP's Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution of

meaning of Section 409A of the Code) (hereinafter referred to as an "HEOP

respect to the Transaction, other than a fee payable by PPBI to D.A. Davidson
and Co. (j) Regulatory Matters. (i) Since January 1, 2013, PPBI and each of
its Subsidiaries has duly filed with the appropriate bank regulatory
authorities in substantially correct form the monthly, quarterly and annual
reports required to be filed under applicable laws and regulations, and such
reports were in all material respects complete and accurate and in compliance
with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. In connection with
the most recent examination of PPBI and each of its Subsidiaries by the
appropriate regulatory authorities, neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries
was required to correct or change any action, procedure or proceeding which
PPBI believes in good faith has not now been corrected or changed, other than
corrections or changes which, if not made, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on PPBI. The most recent
regulatory rating given to Pacific  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre052.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 48 Premier as to compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act
is "satisfactory." To the Knowledge of PPBI, since Pacific Premier's last
regulatory examination of Community Reinvestment Act compliance, Pacific
Premier has not received any complaints as to Community Reinvestment Act
compliance. (ii) Neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of any of
their respective properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree,
directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement
with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary
supervisory letter from, nor has PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries adopted any
policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any
Governmental Authority. PPBI and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments
made or imposed by any Governmental Authority. (iii) Neither PPBI nor any
its Subsidiaries has been advised by, and does not have any Knowledge of
facts which would reasonably be expected to give rise to an advisory notice
by, any Governmental Authority that such Governmental Authority is

issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, directive, agreement,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure or board
resolution. (iv) (A) No Governmental Authority has initiated since December
31, 2012 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to PPBI's

normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Authority in the ordinary
course of the business of PPBI or the applicable Subsidiary), or, to PPBI's
Knowledge, threatened any of the foregoing, and (B) there is no unresolved
violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Governmental Authority with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of PPBI or its Subsidiaries, except in each case in subparagraphs
(A) and (B), that did not have a Material Adverse Effect. (v) PPBI and
Pacific Premier are "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined at 12 CFR
§225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of its primary federal bank regulator)
and the rating of Pacific Premier under the CRA is no less than
"satisfactory." Neither PPBI nor Pacific Premier has received any
notification from a Governmental Authority that their status as "well-
capitalized" or "satisfactory" for CRA purposes will change within one year,
nor does PPBI have Knowledge of any conditions or circumstances that would
result in a CRA rating of less than "satisfactory" or material criticism from
regulators with respect to discriminatory lending practices. (k) Compliance
With Laws. Each of PPBI and its Subsidiaries: (i) is, and at all times since
December 31, 2012 has been in material compliance with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, codes, regulations,
ordinances, rules, judgments, injunctions, orders, decrees or policies and/or
guidelines of a Governmental Authority applicable thereto or to the employees
conducting such businesses, including, without limitation, Section 23A and

Governmental Authority (A) asserting that PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries is
not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which

limitation, as a result of being deemed a single employer with any entity
under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (collectively,

parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Registration

attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it) (all of the
foregoing, collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be ongoing with

similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including by
requesting the other party to promptly return or destroy any confidential

may, in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not solicited
in violation of this Section 6.07(a) that the HEOP Board determines in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, subject to providing two (2) Business
Days prior written notice of its decision to take such action to PPBI and

with respect to itself to any Person making such a Superior Proposal pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by HEOP after
consultation with its outside counsel) on terms no more favorable to such
Person than the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to PPBI,

person beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of Equity Securities of
HEOP or Heritage Oaks Bank or (z) merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving HEOP or Heritage Oaks Bank, other than the Transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made by a third party
to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the shares of HEOP Common Stock then outstanding or
all or substantially all of HEOP's consolidated assets, which the HEOP Board
determines in good faith, after taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), and after consulting with HEOP's financial
advisor (which shall be a recognized investment banking firm) and outside
counsel, (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on
the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required,
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the HEOP Board, is
reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party. (b) In addition to the
obligations of HEOP set forth in Section 6.07(a), HEOP shall promptly (within
24 hours) advise PPBI orally and in writing of its receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal and keep PPBI reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the
continuing status thereof, including the material terms and conditions
thereof and any material changes thereto, and shall contemporaneously provide
to PPBI all materials provided to or made available to any third party
pursuant to this Section 6.07 which were not previously provided to PPBI. (c)
HEOP agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.07 by any Representative of HEOP or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a
breach of this Section 6.07 by HEOP. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent HEOP or its Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

#48295864_v10 58 (e) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.07(a) were
violated by HEOP, its Subsidiaries or any Representative of HEOP or its
Subsidiaries. It is accordingly agreed that PPBI shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of Section 6.07 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which PPBI is entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys'
fees or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the
obligations herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach
thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of
prosecution or defense, PPBI shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein. 6.08 Certain Policies. Prior to
the Effective Date, upon the request of PPBI, HEOP shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and
regulations, use their commercially reasonable best efforts to modify or
change their Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
PPBI; provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made
prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and
further provided that in any event, no such modification or change made by
HEOP or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of
previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of HEOP or its management with any such adjustments.
6.09 Nasdaq Listing. PPBI shall, as promptly as practicable, file all
documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq
the shares of PPBI Common Stock to be issued to the HEOP shareholders (i) as
the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, (ii) upon the
exercise of Converted HEOP Options, and (iii) in connection with the
conversion of the unvested restricted shares of HEOP Common Stock into shares
of PPBI Common Stock. 6.10 Indemnification. (a) From and after the Effective
Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, PPBI and the
Surviving Corporation (each an "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of HEOP or a
HEOP Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she
was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of HEOP or any HEOP
Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of HEOP or any HEOP Subsidiary
as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre063.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 59 other enterprise, including, without limitation, matters
related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or
consummation of the Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified
Parties would be entitled under the HEOP Articles and the HEOP Bylaws or any
agreement, arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in Section
6.10 of HEOP's Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof. PPBI shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses
as incurred by such Indemnified Parties to the same extent as such persons
are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by
HEOP pursuant to the HEOP Articles and the HEOP Bylaws or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in Section 6.10 of
HEOP's Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice
the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless the Indemnified Parties have conflicts of interest), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine by final, non-appealable written order that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations. (c) PPBI (and the Surviving
Corporation) shall maintain HEOP's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy (or provide a policy providing comparable coverage
and amounts on terms no less favorable to the persons currently covered by
HEOP's existing policy, including PPBI's existing policy if it meets the
foregoing standard) covering persons who are currently covered by such
insurance for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that in no event shall PPBI be obligated to expend, in order to
maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), an
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums paid by HEOP as of the date
hereof for such insurance ("Maximum Insurance Amount"); provided further,
that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure
such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Insurance Amount, PPBI shall
obtain the most advantageous coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Insurance Amount. PPBI shall provide proof of such coverage to
HEOP no later than 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Time.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre064.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 60 (d) The obligations of PPBI and the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties
in a manner adverse to any Indemnified Party or any other Person entitled to
the benefits of this Section 6.10, or to whom this Section 6.10 applies,
without the written consent of the effected Indemnified Party or Parties
and/or such other Person, as the case may be. If PPBI or any of its
successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other
entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of PPBI shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.10. (e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and his or her representatives, as set forth in Section 9.07
herein, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise. 6.11 Benefit Plans. (a) As soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Time, PPBI shall take all reasonable action
so that employees of HEOP and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
participate in each PPBI Benefit Plan of general applicability to the same
extent as similarly- situated employees of PPBI and its Subsidiaries (it being
understood that inclusion of the employees of HEOP and its Subsidiaries in
the PPBI Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different
plans), provided that coverage shall be continued under the corresponding
Benefit Plans of HEOP and its Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted
to participate in the PPBI Benefit Plans and provided further, however, that
nothing contained herein shall require PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries to
make any grants to any former employee of HEOP and its Subsidiaries under any
discretionary equity compensation plan of PPBI. PPBI shall cause each PPBI
Benefit Plan in which employees of HEOP and its Subsidiaries are eligible to
participate to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate in, the vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not
for accrual of pension benefits) under the PPBI Benefit Plans, the service of
such employees with HEOP and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such
service was credited for such purpose by HEOP and its Subsidiaries, provided,
however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent not
otherwise permissible under the terms of a PPBI Benefit Plan. Nothing herein
shall limit the ability of PPBI to amend or terminate any of the PPBI Benefit
Plans or the HEOP Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.
(b) At and following the Effective Time, PPBI shall honor, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with
their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current
and former employees of HEOP and its Subsidiaries and current and former
directors of HEOP and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as
well as all bonus, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement plan, salary
continuation, severance, termination, change in control and other existing
plans and policies of HEOP and its Subsidiaries to the extent that each of
the foregoing are Previously Disclosed.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre065.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 61 (c) At such time as employees of HEOP and its Subsidiaries
become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, health, life or
disability plan of PPBI or its Subsidiaries, PPBI shall cause each such plan
to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such
conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of
PPBI, (ii) provide full credit under medical, health and dental plans for any
deductibles, co-payment and out-of- pocket expenses incurred by the employees
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under a corresponding HEOP Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that such waiver shall not be
required to the extent that such waiver would result in a duplication of
benefits or to the extent not otherwise permissible under the terms of a
contract insuring benefits under the PPBI Benefit Plans. (d) Those employees
of HEOP and its Subsidiaries who are not offered employment by PPBI or its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, who are not a party to an
employment agreement or otherwise entitled to an existing severance package
and who sign and deliver the termination and release agreement accompanying
the severance policy adopted by HEOP and set forth in Section 6.11(d) of
HEOP's Disclosure Schedule, within 30 days of the Effective Time, shall be
entitled to receive a single lump sum payment of severance in an amount and
in accordance with the terms of the severance policy adopted by HEOP and set
forth in Section 6.11(d) of HEOP's Disclosure Schedule. If HEOP or any of its
Subsidiaries has any other severance pay plan or arrangement, then any
amounts paid pursuant to that plan or arrangement shall reduce the amount
that the employee will receive under this Section 6.11(d) and in no event
shall there be any duplication of severance pay. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.11(d) hereof shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in
any way PPBI's or its Subsidiaries at will employment policy or provide any
third party beneficiary rights to employees of HEOP or any of its
Subsidiaries. In no event shall severance pay be taken into account in
determining the amount of any other benefit (including but not limited to, an
individual's benefit under any retirement plan or policy). (e) Prior to the
Closing, HEOP shall have paid into the Heritage Oaks Bank Retirement Plan
(the "HEOP Retirement Plan") all discretionary employer contributions,
including any employer matching contributions, profit sharing contributions or
other non- elective contributions. Prior to the Closing, HEOP shall (i) adopt
written resolutions (or take such other necessary or appropriate action), in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to PPBI, to terminate the HEOP
Retirement Plan in compliance with its terms and requirements of applicable
law, effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date and
(ii) provide for full vesting of all non-elective contributions under the
HEOP Retirement Plan for all participants who currently maintain an account
under the HEOP Retirement Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective
no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date. HEOP shall provide
PPBI with evidence of the termination of the HEOP Retirement Plan. (f) Each
of HEOP and PPBI acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained within
this Section 6.11 with respect to Employees are included for the sole benefit
of HEOP and nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.11. Nothing contained  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre066.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 62 herein (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify
any benefit plan, program or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability
of PPBI to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program or
arrangement at any time established, sponsored or maintained by PPBI or any
of its Subsidiaries. Each of HEOP and PPBI agrees that the terms of this
Section 6.11 do not and shall not create any right in any Person to continued
employment with HEOP, PPBI or any of their respective Subsidiaries or to any
compensation or benefit. 6.12 Employment Agreements. As of the date of this
Agreement, Rob Osterbauer and Brooks Wise shall have entered into employment
agreements ("Employment Agreements") with Pacific Premier Bank, which shall
be effective as of the Closing Date and with the terms and in the form which
are set forth in Section 6.12 of PPBI's Disclosure Schedule (and such
Employment Agreements shall supersede and replace Messrs. Osterbauer's and
Wise's current salary protection agreements with Heritage Oaks Bank, which
shall be cancelled and have no further force and effect). 6.13 Appointment
of Directors; Establishment of Community Advisory Board. (a) PPBI agrees to
take all action necessary to appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective
Time, three individuals, each of whom shall be mutually agreeable to PPBI and
HEOP and one of whom shall be Simone F. Lagomarsino, as directors of PPBI and
Pacific Premier. Each individual shall serve until the first annual meeting
of stockholders of PPBI following the Effective Time and until his or her
successor is elected and qualified. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the
PPBI Board, PPBI shall include such individuals on the list of nominees for
director presented by the PPBI Board and for which the PPBI Board shall
solicit proxies at the first annual meeting of stockholders of PPBI following
the Effective Time. (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, PPBI shall
establish a Community Advisory Board for the Central Coast Region, which
shall be comprised of all members of the HEOP Board as of the Effective Time
who are willing to so serve. PPBI expects that the Community Advisory Board
shall hold regular meetings in accordance with and pursuant to such terms and
rules of procedure as shall be adopted. 6.14 Notification of Certain Matters.
Each of HEOP and PPBI shall give prompt written notice to the other of any
fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances
known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or
(b) would cause or constitute a failure of any of the conditions provided for
in Article VII. 6.15 Estoppel Letters. HEOP shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to PPBI at the Closing with respect
to the real estate leased by HEOP or a HEOP Subsidiary, an estoppel letter
dated as of the Closing in substantially the form of Annex D attached hereto
from its lessor. 6.16 Assumption of Indenture Obligations. As of the
Effective Time, PPBI shall have assumed or caused one of its Subsidiaries to
assume the obligations under the Indentures and such assumptions shall have
been expressly agreed to by the Trustee under each such Indenture.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre067.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 63 In connection therewith, PPBI and HEOP shall execute and
deliver any supplemental indentures or other documents reasonably required by
the Trustee to make such assumptions effective. 6.17 Antitakeover Statutes.
Each of PPBI and HEOP and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any
state antitakeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement and the Transaction, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure
that the Transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement and the Transaction. 6.18 Consents.
HEOP shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals, waivers, non-
objections and to deliver any notices required pursuant to the terms of the
Material Contracts as a result of the Transaction. 6.19 Exemption from
Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective Time, each of PPBI and
HEOP shall take all steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of HEOP Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of such shares of HEOP Common Stock in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. ARTICLE VII

contain any conditions, restrictions or requirements (other than conditions

reduce the economic benefits of the Transaction to such a degree that PPBI,
in its reasonable discretion, would not have entered into this Agreement had

of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein,
which breach (i) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the
giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach and (ii) would
entitle the non- breaching party not to consummate the Transaction

case may be. (c) Delay. By PPBI or HEOP in the event the Merger is not
consummated by August 30, 2017, except to the extent that the failure of the

Agreement or (ii) the failure of any of the Shareholders (if HEOP is the party
seeking to terminate) to perform or observe their respective covenants and

Approval. By PPBI or HEOP in the event the approval of any Governmental
Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by final non-appealable
action of such Governmental Authority, or any Governmental Authority shall

otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or an application therefor shall
have been permanently withdrawn at the formal or informal request of a
Governmental Authority, provided, however, that no party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if such denial
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants of such party set forth herein. (e) No
HEOP Shareholder Approval. By PPBI if the approval of the shareholders of
HEOP contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of

No PPBI Shareholder Approval. By HEOP if the approval of the shareholders of
PPBI contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of

offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of HEOP
Common Stock is commenced (other than by PPBI or a Subsidiary thereof), and
the HEOP Board recommends that the shareholders of HEOP tender their shares
in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such
shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10)
Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act. (i)
Change in Recommendation. Provided that HEOP is not then in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, including
without limitation Section 6.02 and 6.07, by HEOP, if the HEOP Board effects
a permissible Change in Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.02(b),
provided further, that such termination shall not be effective until HEOP has
paid the Termination Fee required by Section 8.02(b) to PPBI. 8.02 Effect of
Termination and Abandonment. (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no
party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any
other party hereunder except that (i) this Section 8.02, Section 6.06(c) and
Article IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither PPBI nor HEOP shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud
or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement. (b) The parties hereto
agree that HEOP shall pay PPBI the sum of $15.0 million (the "Termination
Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows: (i) if this Agreement is
terminated by PPBI pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or (h), or by HEOP pursuant to
Section 8.01(i), HEOP shall pay the entire Termination Fee to PPBI on the
second Business Day following the termination of this Agreement; or (ii) if
this Agreement is terminated by (A) PPBI pursuant to Section 8.01(b), (B) by
either PPBI or HEOP pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and at the time of such
termination no vote of the HEOP shareholders contemplated by this Agreement at
the HEOP Meeting shall have occurred, or (C) by PPBI pursuant to Section
8.01(e), and in the case of any termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or
(C), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and
communicated or made known to the executive officers of HEOP or the HEOP
Board (or any Person shall have publicly announced and communicated or made
known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
Proposal, or reiterated a previously expressed plan or intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the taking of the vote of the shareholders of HEOP contemplated by this
Agreement at the HEOP Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or the date of
termination, in the case of clause (A) or (B), then (1) if within 9 months
after such termination HEOP enters into an agreement with respect to a
Control Transaction, which was the subject of such Acquisition Proposal, then
HEOP shall pay to PPBI an amount equal to $11.25 million on the date of
execution of such agreement and upon consummation of such Control Transaction
at any time thereafter, HEOP shall pay to PPBI the remainder of the
Termination Fee on the date of such consummation and (2) if a Control
Transaction is consummated otherwise than pursuant  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre072.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 68 to an agreement with HEOP within 12 months after such
termination, then HEOP shall pay to PPBI the Termination Fee (less any amount
previously paid by HEOP pursuant to clause (1) above) on the date of such
consummation of such Control Transaction. As used in this Section 8.02(b), a
"Control Transaction" means (i) the acquisition by any Person whether by
purchase, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer or otherwise, in one
transaction or any series of transactions, of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding securities of HEOP or Heritage Oaks Bank or a majority of
the assets of HEOP or Heritage Oaks Bank, (ii) any issuance of securities
resulting in the ownership by any Person of more than 50% of the voting power
of HEOP or by any Person other than HEOP or its Subsidiaries of more than 50%
of the voting power of Heritage Oaks Bank or (iii) any merger, consolidation
or other business combination transaction involving HEOP or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of which the shareholders of HEOP cease to own, in
the aggregate, at least 50% of the total voting power of the entity surviving
or resulting from such transaction. Any amount that becomes payable pursuant
to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by PPBI. Under no circumstances
shall HEOP be obligated to pay the entire Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, and the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event the
entire Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by HEOP pursuant to this
Section 8.02, the Termination Fee shall be PPBI's sole and exclusive remedy
under this Agreement. (c) HEOP and PPBI agree that the agreement contained in
paragraph (b) above is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that without such agreement PPBI would not have entered into
this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty or
liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by HEOP. If
HEOP fails to pay PPBI the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the
time periods specified in such paragraph (b), HEOP shall pay the costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by PPBI in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to
collect payment of such amounts, provided PPBI prevails on the merits,
together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street
Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required
to be paid until the date of actual payment. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS 9.01
Survival. No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained
in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than agreements or
covenants contained herein that by their express terms are to be performed
after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections
6.06(c), 8.02 and this Article IX, which shall survive any such termination).
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations,
warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive a party hereto or
any of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity which otherwise
would be available against the claims of any Person, including without
limitation any shareholder or former shareholder.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre073.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 69 9.02 Waiver; Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, any
provision of this Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the
provision or (ii) amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing
among the parties hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement,
except that after the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by
the HEOP shareholders, no amendment shall be made which by law requires
further approval by the shareholders of HEOP without obtaining such approval.
For purposes of clarification, an amendment of any date in Section 8.01(c)
shall not require further approval by any shareholders and if such amendment
were deemed by law to require further approval by the shareholders of HEOP,
the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by the HEOP shareholders
will be deemed to have granted HEOP the authority to amend such dates without
such further approval. 9.03 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be deemed to constitute one and
the same original agreement. 9.04 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within
such State. 9.05 Expenses. Each party hereto will bear all expenses incurred
by it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants,
accountants and counsel; provided that nothing contained herein shall limit
either party's rights to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the
other party's fraud or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.
9.06 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a
party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,
telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) or delivered by an overnight courier (with
confirmation) to such party at its address set forth below or such other
address as such party may specify by notice to the parties hereto. If to HEOP

Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, and the Confidentiality
Agreement supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore
made. Except for the Indemnified Parties' right to enforce PPBI's obligation
under Section 6.10, which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto
or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 9.08 Severability. Except
to the extent that application of this Section 9.08 would have a Material
Adverse Effect on HEOP or PPBI, any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar
as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this
Agreement. 9.09 Enforcement of the Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Except as provided in Section 8.02(b), it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to

#48295864_v10 71 prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys'
fees or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the
obligations herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach
thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of
prosecution or defense, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein. 9.10 Interpretation.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or
Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or Schedule to,
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date hereof" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year first above
written. 9.11 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 9.12
Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, PPBI may at any time modify the structure of the acquisition of HEOP
set forth herein, provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to
the holders of HEOP Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in
amount as a result of such modification, (ii) such modifications will not
adversely affect the tax treatment to HEOP's shareholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration and (iii) such modification will not
jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities or
delay consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

#48295864_v10 A-1 ANNEX A SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement"), dated as of December , 2016, among __________________, a
shareholder ("Shareholder") of Heritage Oaks Bancorp, a California
corporation ("HEOP"), Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("PPBI"), and, solely for purposes of the last sentence of Section 9, HEOP.
All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned
thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below). WHEREAS, HEOP and PPBI are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of the date
hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which HEOP will merge with and
into PPBI on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger") and,
in connection therewith, outstanding shares of HEOP Common Stock will be
converted into shares of PPBI Common Stock in the manner set forth therein;
and WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of HEOP Common Stock identified on
Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of HEOP Common Stock
subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being
referred to as the "Shares"); and WHEREAS, in order to induce PPBI to enter
into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such Shareholder's capacity
as a shareholder of HEOP and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter
into and perform this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1\. Agreement to Vote
Shares. Shareholder agrees while this Agreement is in effect, that at any
meeting of the shareholders of HEOP, or in connection with any written consent
of the shareholders of HEOP, Shareholder shall: (a) appear at each such
meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present thereat for
purposes of calculating a quorum; and (b) vote (or cause to be voted), in
person or by proxy, or deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be
delivered) covering, all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or
hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which
Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the
voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (y) against any action
or agreement that to the knowledge of the Shareholder would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or
any other obligation or agreement of HEOP contained in the Merger Agreement
or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any
Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is
intended, or to the knowledge of the Shareholder would reasonably be
expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay,
postpone, discourage or materially and adversely

Transfer of Shares. (a) Prohibition on Transfers of Shares; Other Actions.
Shareholder hereby agrees that while this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder
shall not, (i) sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, distribute by gift or
donation, or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) or any interest
therein, whether by actual disposition, physical settlement or effective
economic disposition through hedging transactions, derivative instruments or
other means, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
any Person, or take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or
could reasonably be expected to violate or conflict with Shareholder's
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement,
or (iii) take any other action that could reasonably be expected to impair or
otherwise adversely affect, in any material respect, Shareholder's power,
authority and ability to comply with and perform his, her or its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that once the Shares have
been voted at the HEOP Meeting as provided for in Section 1(b)(x) hereof, and
provided that at least a majority of all of the issued and outstanding shares
of HEOP Common Stock have been irrevocably voted in favor of the Merger, the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the HEOP
Meeting as provided for in Section 1(b)(x) hereof, then the prohibitions
provided for in this Section 2 shall no longer apply to Shareholder. (b)
Transfer of Voting Rights. Shareholder hereby agrees that Shareholder shall
not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into any
voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to any of
the Shares. 3\. Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder
represents and warrants to and agrees with PPBI as follows: (a) Capacity.
Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. (b) Binding
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder
and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles. (c) Non-Contravention.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the
performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation

#48295864_v10 A-3 to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that
Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder. (d)
Ownership. Shareholder's Shares are, and, except as otherwise provided for in
Section 2(a) hereof, through the term of this Agreement will be, owned
beneficially and of record solely by Shareholder, except as otherwise
disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. Shareholder has title to the Shares, free and
clear of any lien, pledge, mortgage, security interest or other encumbrance,
except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. As of the date hereof, the
Shares identified on Exhibit I hereto constitute all of the shares of HEOP
Common Stock owned beneficially or of record by Shareholder. Shareholder has
and, except as otherwise provided for in Section 2(a) above, will have at all
times during the term of this Agreement (i) sole voting power and sole power
to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth in Section 1
hereof, (ii) sole power of disposition and (iii) sole power to agree to all
of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to all
of the Shares owned by Shareholder on the date of this Agreement and all of
the Shares hereafter acquired by Shareholder and owned beneficially or of
record by him, her or it during the term of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, provided that a Person
shall be deemed to beneficially own any securities which may be acquired by
such Person pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon
the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or
otherwise (irrespective of whether the right to acquire such securities is
exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, including the
passage of time within 60 days, the satisfaction of any conditions, the
occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing). (e) Consents
and Approvals. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder
does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations
under this Agreement and the consummation by him, her or it of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, require Shareholder to obtain any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority. (f) Absence of Litigation.
There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Shareholder, threatened against or affecting Shareholder or any
of his, her or its affiliates before or by any Governmental Authority that
could reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Shareholder
to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis. 4\. No Solicitation.
Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement he, she or
it shall not, and shall not permit any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it to,
directly or indirectly, (a) take any of the actions specified in clauses
(i)-(vi) of Section 6.07(a) of the Merger Agreement, (b) agree to release, or
release, any Person from any obligation under any existing standstill
agreement or arrangement relating to HEOP, or (c) participate in, directly or
indirectly, a  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre080.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 A-4 "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the
rules of the SEC) or powers of attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to
advise or influence any Person with respect to the voting of, any shares of
HEOP Common Stock in connection with any vote or other action on any matter of
a type described in Section 1(b), other than to recommend that shareholders of
HEOP vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and
the Merger and as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement.
Shareholder agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than PPBI with respect to any possible
Acquisition Proposal and will take all necessary steps to inform any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by him, her or it of the obligations undertaken by
Shareholder pursuant to this Section 4. Nothing contained in this Section 4
shall prevent a Shareholder who is an officer or a member of the HEOP Board
from discharging his or her fiduciary duties solely in his or her capacity as
such an officer or director. 5\. Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding
Prohibited Transactions. Shareholder hereby agrees to notify PPBI promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of
any additional shares of HEOP Common Stock or other securities of HEOP of
which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the
date hereof. Shareholder will comply with the provisions of Section 6.07(b) of
the Merger Agreement as if he, she or it were HEOP. 6\. Non-Solicitation.
(a) The Shareholder agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing Date, the Shareholder will not directly or indirectly: (i) solicit
(other than general solicitations through newspapers or other media of
general circulation, or the engagement of professional search firms, not
targeted at such employees) any employees of HEOP or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing ("HEOP Employees"); provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not apply to any HEOP Employee (Y) who does not become an employee of PPBI or
any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date; or (Z) whose employment
terminated more than six months prior to the time that such HEOP Employee is
first solicited for employment following the Closing Date; or (ii) knowingly
(A) induce, persuade, encourage or influence or attempt to induce, persuade,
encourage or influence any Person having a business relationship with PPBI,
HEOP or their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates prior to the Closing
Date, to discontinue, reduce or restrict such relationship after the Closing
Date or (B) solicit or target the deposits, loans or other products and
services from or to Persons who were depositors, borrowers or customers of
HEOP or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and/or as of the
Closing Date, whether by personal contact, by telephone, by facsimile, by
mail or other form of solicitation or communication, or in any other way
except for general solicitations that are directed to the general public and
not directed specifically to Persons who were depositors, borrowers or
customers of HEOP or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, or as of
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre081.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 A-5 foregoing and for purposes of clarity, nothing herein shall
prohibit the Shareholder from exercising Shareholder's discretion relating to
Shareholder's personal and business banking relationships. (b) The
Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by HEOP and
its Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants made by the
Shareholder in this Section 6 are made as a necessary inducement for PPBI to
enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of this Section 6 shall be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is expressly understood and
agreed that although the Shareholder and PPBI each consider the restrictions
contained in this Section 6 to be reasonable, if a final determination is
made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or
territory or any other restriction contained in this Section 6 is
unenforceable against any party, the provisions of this Section 6 shall be
deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such
maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable. (c) The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions
of this Agreement are necessary to protect PPBI's legitimate business
interests and to protect the value of PPBI's acquisition of HEOP. The
Shareholder warrants that these provisions will not unreasonably interfere
with his or her ability to earn a living or to pursue his or her occupation
and the Shareholder has the means to support himself or herself and his or
her dependents and the provisions of this Section 6 will not impair such
ability in any manner whatsoever. (d) The Shareholder will not, at any time
during the two-year period referred to in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement,
disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, or the business
conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, or any
stockholder, member, director, manager, officer, employee or agent of PPBI,
its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates. 7\. Specific Performance and
Remedies. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in
money the damage to PPBI if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations
imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, PPBI
will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law
or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not
oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that PPBI may have an
adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and
agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with PPBI's seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. 8\. Term
of Agreement; Termination. (a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on
the date hereof.  

  

 ![](ppbiex21heritageoaksagre082.jpg) 

#48295864_v10 A-6 (b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to
occur of (i) the date, if any, of termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, or (ii) the Effective Time of the Merger. Upon
such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is
terminated upon the Effective Time of the Merger, the provisions in Section 6
shall survive for a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date. 9\. Stop
Transfer Order. In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder hereby
authorizes and instructs HEOP to enter a stop transfer order with respect to
all of Shareholder's Shares for the period from the date hereof through the
date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8, except as
otherwise provided for in Section 2(a) hereof. HEOP agrees that it shall
comply with such stop transfer instructions. 10\. Entire Agreement. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions
hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed
by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party shall
be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor
shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by
such party. 11\. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when
delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by
telecopy or like transmission and on the next Business Day when sent by a
reputable overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):
