The Exchange Agent and PPBI, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver a &#13;&#10;certificate or certificates representing shares of PPBI Common Stock to which a holder of HEOP &#13;&#10;Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders &#13;&#10;the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of HEOP Common Stock for exchange as &#13;&#10;provided in this Section 3.02, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and &#13;&#10;indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably required in each case by &#13;&#10;PPBI. If any certificates evidencing shares of PPBI Common Stock are to be issued in a name &#13;&#10;other than that in which the Certificate evidencing HEOP Common Stock surrendered in &#13;&#10;exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate &#13;&#10;so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment &#13;&#10;separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person &#13;&#10;requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required by &#13;&#10;reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of PPBI Common Stock in any name other than &#13;&#10;that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the &#13;&#10;satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.  &#13;&#10;(e) Unclaimed Merger Consideration.  Any portion of the shares of PPBI &#13;&#10;Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by PPBI pursuant to Section 3.02(b) that &#13;&#10;remains unclaimed by the shareholders of HEOP for six months after the Effective Time (as well &#13;&#10;as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to PPBI.  &#13;&#10;Any shareholders of HEOP who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.02(c) shall &#13;&#10;thereafter look only to PPBI for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of HEOP &#13;&#10;Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any &#13;&#10;interest thereon.  If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered or the &#13;&#10;payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of PPBI Common Stock &#13;&#10;would otherwise escheat to any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the &#13;&#10;extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of &#13;&#10;PPBI (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims &#13;&#10;or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor &#13;&#10;any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate &#13;&#10;or Book-Entry Share for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable &#13;&#10;abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  PPBI and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to &#13;&#10;rely upon the stock transfer books of HEOP to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to &#13;&#10;receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive (absent &#13;&#10;manifest error) with respect thereto.

At the Effective Time, holders of HEOP Common Stock &#13;&#10;shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of HEOP other than to receive the &#13;&#10;consideration provided for under this Article III. &#13;&#10;3.04 No Fractional Shares.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white"> &#13;&#10;#48295864_v10 &#13;&#10;A-5&#13;&#10; foregoing and for purposes of clarity, nothing herein shall prohibit the &#13;&#10;Shareholder from exercising Shareholder&#8217;s discretion relating to Shareholder&#8217;s &#13;&#10;personal and business banking relationships.   &#13;&#10;(b) The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by &#13;&#10;HEOP and its Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants made by the &#13;&#10;Shareholder in this Section 6 are made as a necessary inducement for PPBI to enter into &#13;&#10;the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.  It is &#13;&#10;the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that the provisions of this Section 6 &#13;&#10;shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies of &#13;&#10;each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  It is expressly understood and agreed &#13;&#10;that although the Shareholder and PPBI each consider the restrictions contained in this &#13;&#10;Section 6 to be reasonable, if a final determination is made by a court of competent &#13;&#10;jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in &#13;&#10;this Section 6 is unenforceable against any party, the provisions of this Section 6 shall be &#13;&#10;deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum &#13;&#10;extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. &#13;&#10;(c) The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this &#13;&#10;Agreement are necessary to protect PPBI&#8217;s legitimate business interests and to protect the &#13;&#10;value of PPBI&#8217;s acquisition of HEOP.  The Shareholder warrants that these provisions &#13;&#10;will not unreasonably interfere with his or her ability to earn a living or to pursue his or &#13;&#10;her occupation and the Shareholder has the means to support himself or herself and his or &#13;&#10;her dependents and the provisions of this Section 6 will not impair such ability in any &#13;&#10;manner whatsoever.  &#13;&#10;(d) The Shareholder will not, at any time during the two-year period referred &#13;&#10;to in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement, disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of its &#13;&#10;Affiliates, or the business conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, &#13;&#10;or any stockholder, member, director, manager, officer, employee or agent of PPBI, its &#13;&#10;Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates. &#13;&#10;7. Specific Performance and Remedies.  Shareholder acknowledges that it will be &#13;&#10;impossible to measure in money the damage to PPBI if Shareholder fails to comply with the &#13;&#10;obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, PPBI will not &#13;&#10;have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other &#13;&#10;equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any &#13;&#10;such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that PPBI may have an &#13;&#10;adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive &#13;&#10;any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with PPBI&#8217;s seeking or &#13;&#10;obtaining such equitable relief.  &#13;&#10;8. Term of Agreement; Termination.  &#13;&#10;(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>
