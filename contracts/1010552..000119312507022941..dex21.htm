-12- ARTICLE II

THE OFFER

2.1 _The Offer_. (a) _Terms of Offer; Conditions to Offer_. Provided that (i)
this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ and
(ii) none of the events set forth in clauses (C)(1)  (C)(7) of _Annex A_
hereto, inclusive, shall have occurred and be continuing, then as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten (10) Business
Days thereafter), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
to purchase all of the Company Shares at a price per Company Share, subject to
the terms of _Section 2.1(b)_, equal to the Offer Price. The obligation of
Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Company Shares
tendered (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for
payment and to pay for any Company Shares tendered) shall be subject only to
(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the then
scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to
time pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_), there be validly tendered in accordance
with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent and
Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of (x) all then
outstanding Company Shares, _plus_ (y) all Company Shares issuable upon the
exercise of all then outstanding Company Options that (A) are vested and
exercisable as of any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer or that
would be vested and exercisable at any time within 120 calendar days following
the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer assuming that the holder of
such Company Options satisfies the vesting conditions applicable thereto (and
after giving effect to the acceleration of any vesting that may occur as a
result of the Offer), and (B) have an exercise price that is less than the
Offer Price, _plus_ , (z) all Company Shares issuable upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of any then outstanding securities (other than Company
Options) that are exercisable or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, Company Shares and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_
hereto. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement
or previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub may make any change to the terms and conditions of the Offer that (A)
decreases the Offer Price, (B) changes the form of consideration to be paid
in the Offer, (C) reduces the number of Company Shares to be purchased in the
Offer, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions to
the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, (E) amends the conditions to the
Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto so as to broaden the scope of such
conditions to the Offer, (F) amends the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex A_ hereto in any manner that is adverse to the holders of Company
Shares, (G) extends the Offer in any manner other than pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of _Section 2.1(c)_, or (H) amends or waives the
Minimum Condition. The conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto
are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent
and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in
their sole discretion, other than (x) the Minimum Condition, and (y) the
conditions set forth in clause (A), (C)(3) and (C)(4) of _Annex I_ hereto if
the directors or officers of the Company would be reasonably likely to have
any material liability as a result of a waiver thereof (after taking into
account the indemnification and insurance provisions set forth this Agreement
for the benefit of such directors and officers), any of which conditions
described in the preceding clauses (x) and



 

-13- (y) may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent
of the Company. The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right,
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.

(b) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance for payment of, and payment
for, Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(c) _Extension and Expiration of Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Offer, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York
Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the Nasdaq that is
applicable to the Offer, (ii) if the Minimum Condition is not satisfied at the
time of any such extension, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for up to three
(3) successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days each in order to
permit the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition; _provided, however_ , that
Merger Sub shall not be required (and, without the prior written approval of
the Company, shall not be permitted) to extend the Offer more than three (3)
times pursuant to this clause (ii), and (iii) in the event that (A) any of the
conditions to the Offer and the other conditions set forth on _Annex_ A
hereto, other than the Minimum Condition, are not satisfied or waived as of
any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer and (B) the Minimum Condition
is satisfied at the time of such expiration date, then Merger Sub shall extend
the Offer for successive extensions periods of ten (10) Business Day each in
order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to the Offer; _provided,
however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii) of this
_Section 2.1(c)_, inclusive, in no event shall Merger Sub be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Initial Termination Date or the Extended
Termination Date, as applicable; and _provided further,_ that the foregoing
clauses (i) - (iii) of  _Section 2.1(c),_ inclusive, shall not be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_.
Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall be entitled to extend the Offer in any
manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 2.1(c)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

(d) _Payment for Company Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, promptly (in accordance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act)  



 

-14-  after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_). The Offer Price payable in respect of
each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for
any applicable U.S. federal withholding or back-up withholding or other Taxes
payable by such holder.

(e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. Merger Sub may (but shall not be required
to), and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right to, provide for a
"subsequent offering period" (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business
days immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so extended by
such subsequent offering period, promptly after any such Company Shares are
tendered during such subsequent offering period in accordance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as so
extended by such subsequent offering period, shall be paid net to the holder
thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable U.S. federal
withholding or back-up withholding or other Taxes payable by such holder.

Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act),

purchase of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of
the Merger in accordance with this Agreement, the Company hereby waives any
and all rights of first refusal it may have with respect to Company Shares
owned by, or issuable to, any Person, other than rights to repurchase unvested
shares, if any, that may be held by Persons pursuant to the grant of
restricted stock purchase rights or following exercise of employee stock
options.

2.3  _Company Boards of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange
Act_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board_. Effective upon the initial acceptance for
payment by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not, unless the
context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its
rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company
Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to
any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and
 



 

-18-  (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Company Shares held
by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding Company Shares. Promptly following a request by Parent, the
Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated
by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including (at the
election of Parent) either by increasing the size of the Company Board or by
seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the resignations of such number of
then incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so
designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. From
time to time after the Appointment Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate)
as is on the Company Board on (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii)
each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each
committee of each such board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company,
in each case to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Legal
Requirements, and specifically including the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq
Global Market. Promptly after the Appointment Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as
defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. Solely for purposes of this _Section
2.3_, any and all members of the Company Board immediately prior to such
appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after such appointments
by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_ " and each as a "
_Continuing Director_." At least three (3) of the Continuing Directors shall
be "independent directors" as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the
Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and at least one
Continuing Director shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined
in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto.

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all action required pursuant to this  _Section 2.3_ and
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 2.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required under
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in writing, and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, directors, officers and affiliates, required by such Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1.

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to  _Section 2.3(a)_ and there shall be any Continuing Directors,
the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the sole
Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director) shall
be required in order to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or
consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, in any case on  



 

-19-  behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive,
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under
this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement
or (iv) make any other determination with respect to any action to be taken or
not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(i) The Company hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, that
number of shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Common Stock owned by Parent and its subsidiaries and affiliates at
the time of such exercise, shall constitute ten thousand (10,000) shares more
than 90% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, (A) immediately
prior to such exercise, Merger Sub and Parent collectively hold Company Shares
in excess of 80% of the Company Shares then outstanding and (B) immediately
after such exercise and the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant
thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares); (y) that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be
exercisable for a number of shares of Common stock in excess of the Companys
total authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock; and (z) in no event
shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for more than an aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock that is equal to 19.9% of the shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof (or such greater amount as may be
issuable under Rule 4350(i) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules without the
approval of the Companys stockholders). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub may
transfer the Top-Up Option to any other Person, other than a wholly-owned
direct or indirect subsidiary of the Parent, without the prior written
consent of the Company.

(ii) Provided that no applicable law, rule, regulation, order, injunction or
other legal impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make
such exercise or issuance illegal, Parent may exercise the Top-Up Option, in
whole but not in part, at any one time after the Appointment Time and prior
to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

(iii) In the event Parent wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall
send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ," the date
of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_ ")
specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the
Top-Up Option Shares which the Parent wishes to receive, and the place, time
and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up
Option (the " _Top-Up_ Closing"). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of
the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Parent confirming
the number  



 

-20-  of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefore (the "
_Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, Parent shall pay the
Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares
by wire transfer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount
specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Parent a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option
Shares. Such certificates may include any legends that are required by federal
or state securities laws.

(iv) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Company Shares which Merger Sub
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under
the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder. Parent and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an Accredited Investor, as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Merger Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares are being and will
be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to
or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning
of the Securities Act.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall

who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 3.7_. Such stockholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Company Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to

or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for

restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company ("

Effective Time, then the amounts payable with respect to such shares of
Company Restricted Stock pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.7(a)(i)_
shall be withheld and retained by Parent and shall vest and become payable on
the date that such Company Restricted Stock would have otherwise vested
pursuant to its original vesting schedule as in effect prior to the Effective

(or subsidiary of Parent) payroll date following the vesting date applicable
to such payment.



 

-24- 3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_,

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
or any direct or indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise)) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause
the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_
"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article III_ , and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
such Certificates pursuant to this _Section 3.8_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of the Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered in the stock transfer books  



 

-25-  or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or
any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or non-U.S. law. To
the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the
date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered their Certificates evidencing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_
shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificates
solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate theretofore representing any shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were  



 

-26-  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures,
trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_;
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

3.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and
necessary action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except, with respect to any Section of this _Article IV_ , as set forth in the
section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent on the
date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") that
specifically relates to such Section or in any other section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such Section,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

4.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its respective
organization (to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the
case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure
to be so in "good standing" is not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has the
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its respective business as
it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective
properties and assets. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good
standing" concept is applicable in the  



 

-27-  case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of (a) the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent documents, as
amended to date, of the Company and (b) the minutes (or, in the case of draft
minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders,
the Company Board and each committee of the Company Board, other than those
minutes and consents relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any alternative transactions considered by the Board. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other applicable constituent documents, except for
such violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.2  _Subsidiaries_.

(a) _Section 4.2_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of the name, jurisdiction of organization and function (i.e.,
sales, manufacturing, administration, etc.) of each Subsidiary of the Company.
Except for the Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Person.

(a) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) has been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens and free
of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting
interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of
such Subsidiarys business as presently conducted.

(b) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that obligate the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the
Company, (iii) obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any
subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other
similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of
the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the
capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to
collectively as " _Subsidiary Securities_ ") or (iv) other obligations by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or
value of any shares of any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding
agreements of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding Subsidiary
Securities.



 

-28- 4.3 _Authorization_.

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company and no additional corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of

other operation of such Persons business is infringing upon or otherwise
violating any material Owned Company IP. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have asserted or threatened in writing any claim against any
Person alleging the same.

(j) There is no suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding made,
conducted or brought by a third party that has been served upon or, to
the knowledge of the Company, filed or threatened with respect to, and the
Company has not been notified in writing of, any alleged infringement or other
violation in any material respect by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its or their current products or services or other operation of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries business of the Intellectual Property Rights of
such third party. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or
threatened claim challenging the validity or enforceability of, or contesting
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights with respect to, any of the
material Company IP. To the Companys knowledge, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order of any Governmental Authority that
restricts or impairs the use of any material Company IP.

(k) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) will not
result in (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any
rights or licenses to any Company IP, (ii) any right of termination or
cancellation under any Company IP Agreement, (iii) the imposition of any Lien
on any Owned Company IP, except where any of the foregoing, or (iv) after the
Merger, (1) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates being required to
grant any third party any incremental rights or licenses to any of Parents or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights, (2) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates being
bound by, or subject to, any incremental non-compete or other incremental
material restriction on the operation or scope of their respective businesses,
or (3) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates being obligated to pay
any incremental royalties or other material amounts, offer any incremental
discounts or being bound by any incremental "most favored pricing" terms to
any third party; _provided, however_ , that the representations made in this
Section 4.22(k)(iv) will not be deemed breached solely as a result of the
operation of provisions contained in an agreement or arrangement to which
Parent is a party, but to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
not. As used in this Section 4.22(k)(iv), an "incremental" right, non-compete,
restriction, royalty, amount, discount or "most favored pricing" term refers
to a right, non-compete, restriction, royalty, amount, discount or "most
favored pricing" term, as applicable, in excess, whether in terms of
contractual term,  



 

-51-  contractual rate or scope, of those that would have been required to be
offered or granted, as applicable, had the parties to this Agreement not
entered into this Agreement or consummated the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(l) To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no material design defects or other errors in the Company Products,
including (i) any defects or errors that would permit unauthorized access to
computers or systems of users through those Company Products, (ii) any defects
or errors which have led or would reasonably be expected to lead to any broad
or limited recall of the Company Products or (iii) any defects or errors which
affect the safety, functionality or use of the Company Products for their
intended purposes, including defects or errors including any batteries or
similar components of the Companys Products. The Company and it Subsidiaries
have taken reasonable steps and implemented reasonable procedures to prevent
viruses and other disabling codes from entering Company Products.

(m) To the Companys knowledge, _Section 4.22(m)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all software
that is distributed as "open source software" or under a similar licensing or
distribution model (including but not limited to the GNU General Public
License) that that is or was incorporated into or integrated or bundled with
a Company Product _Section 4.22(m)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth, for each use of such open source software, (1) a description of the
functionality of the open source, (2) the applicable license terms (or a
reference thereto), and (3) the applicable Company Product.

(n) To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has experienced any material defects in the
software and hardware used in their business as it is currently conducted that
have not been fully resolved, including any material error or omission in the
processing of any data.

(o) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company Source Code for
the Company Products has been published or disclosed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except (i) to its employees or advisers or pursuant to non-
disclosure agreements, or (ii) to third-party escrow agents pursuant to source
code escrow agreements, or, to the knowledge of the Company, by any other
person except as authorized by the Company under a non-disclosure agreement.
To the knowledge of the Company, no condition has occurred that would be
sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow
arrangement under which the Company has deposited any material Company Source
Code for any Company Product to require release of such Company Source Code,
other than conditions that relate to the solvency or financial condition of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that relate to the involvement of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in any bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or other activity or proceeding under state or federal
law relating to insolvency or the protection of creditors. The consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger)
will not constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under
any source code escrow arrangement under which the Company has deposited any
material Company Source Code for any Company Product to require release of
such Company Source Code.



 

-52- (p) To the Companys knowledge, the Companys and its Subsidiaries collection

officers liability and other casualty and liability insurance, which the
Company believes is adequate for the operation of its business. All such
insurance policies are in full force and effect, no notice of cancellation has
been received, and there is no existing default or event which, with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, by any
insured thereunder, except for such defaults that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is
no material claim pending under any of such policies as to which coverage has
been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies and
there has been no threatened termination of, or material premium increase with
respect to, any such policies.

4.24 _Export Control and Import Laws_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Export
Control and Import Laws with respect to the conduct of the business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except for such violations or
noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b)  _Section 4.24_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately describes
all of the licenses and license exceptions currently held or claimed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the export of goods, services, items,
software, technology, or technical data and the listed licenses and license
exceptions are all of the licenses and exceptions necessary for the continued
export of goods, services, items, software, technology, or technical data of
the Company or any Subsidiary. All such licenses are valid and in full force
and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all terms and conditions of any license issued or approved by
the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, the Bureau of Industry and
Security, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control which is or has been in
force. No circumstances exist which could cause any export license to be
terminated, revoked, or suspended.

(c) Except pursuant to valid licenses, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
not released or disclosed controlled technical data or technology to
any foreign national whether in the United State or abroad.

(d) No action, proceeding, writ, injunction, claim, request for information,
or subpoena is pending, or to the best of the Companys knowledge,  



 

-53-  threatened, concerning or relating to any Export or Import activity of the
Company or any Subsidiary. There are no voluntary self disclosures that have
been filed by or for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
possible violations of Export Control and Import Laws.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any fact or
circumstance that could result in any liability for violation of Export
Control and Import Laws that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries, including all of their customs brokers
and freight forwarders, have maintained all records required to be maintained
in the Companys and its Subsidiaries possession as required under the Export
Control and Import Laws.

compensation or other employment arrangements in the ordinary course
(including reimbursement of Company Board expenses for attendance at

its Subsidiaries who is entitled to any financial advisors, brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger).

4.27 _Opinion of Financial Advisors_. The Company has received the opinion of
Avondale Partners LLC to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of
Company Common Stock from a financial point of view, and, as of the date of
this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified.

4.28 _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in _Section 5.6_ are accurate, the Company
Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable law are not applicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the Tender
and Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby. No other

to apply to the Offer, the Merger, the Tender and Voting Agreements or the

Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub, (B) a customer or
potential customer in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
Company practices, (C) a Governmental Authority, or (D) any other third party

withdrawn) a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing any
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, provided that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated (or be deemed, pursuant to the
terms of this _Section 7.1_, to have breached or violated) the terms of this

Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.1_ by the
Company. The Company shall not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement as

_Section 9.4_, if any.

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in  _Section
7.1(b)_, the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty four (24)
hours of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably

order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, (iv) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business

favorable to Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal.

taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule

Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the

Common Stock necessary to conduct business at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall solicit from the Company
Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance
with Delaware Law, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the
Requisite Stockholder Vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ , the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, whether or not the Company
Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine that this Agreement
is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Companys obligation to establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section
7.3(a)_ shall not be limited to, or otherwise affected by, the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any

of Parent, Merger Sub and the  



 

-65-  Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without
a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253
of the DGCL.

7.4 _Proxy Statement_.

order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of
the DGCL, as soon as practicable following the Appointment Time, the Company

Proxy Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from
the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger and the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall

with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Legal
Requirements, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as
promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff

thereon. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions
to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto, or
requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such
information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ ,
subject to the terms of _Section 7.2(b)_, the Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than with respect to
the Offer).

7.5 _Efforts to Complete_. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist  



 

-66-  and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), including: (i) using
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Offer set forth on
_Annex A_ hereto and the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article
VIII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled, including filing as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof with the SEC all annual, quarterly and
current reports required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act
for any and all periods ending prior to the scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, which such annual, quarterly and current reports shall comply as to
form with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to such reports;
(ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary or
appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the
benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger); (iii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental
Authorities, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods,
making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, if any)
and (iv) executing or delivering any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.5(a)_, as soon as may be reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger)
as required by the HSR Act, and, as soon as may be reasonably practical
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any comparable pre-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign
Governmental Authority that may be required by the merger notification or
control laws and regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction or be
deemed desirable by Parent, in each case as Parent may deem necessary and/or
appropriate. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the
other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate such
filings, (iii) supply any additional information that reasonably may be
required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger
control authorities of any other jurisdiction and that Parent reasonably deems
necessary and/or appropriate, and (iv) share equally all filing and other
similar fees (but not expenses, which shall be governed by  _Section 9.4_)
incurred in connection with filings made in connection with this _Section
7.5(b)_. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger). If  



 

-67-  any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of  _Section
7.5(a)_, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its
Affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property,
or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct
their business or to own or exercise control of such business, assets,
properties and stock.

operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request;

7.11 Company Options; Company ESPP

(a)  _Company Options_.

(i) _Outstanding Options Not Being Assumed by Parent_. Parent shall not assume
or otherwise replace any Company Option in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
Company Options, each Company Option shall be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration less
the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ ") (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price
shall not actually be paid to the Company by the holder of a Company Option,
and further understood and agreed that with respect to each Company
Option for which the exercise price exceeds the  



 

-70-  Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled and
extinguished without consideration). Parent shall, or shall cause the Company
to, pay to holders of Company Options the Option Consideration less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(ii) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
provide notice (subject to reasonable review by Parent) to each holder of
Company Options describing the treatment of such Company Options in accordance
with this _Section 7.11_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and conditional upon the Closing, the
Company Board shall make all determinations reasonably necessary under each of
the Company Option Plans to accomplish the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 7.11_ and if, to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger). Conditional upon the Closing, the Company shall take all appropriate
or necessary steps to effect the termination of the Company Option Plans as of
the Effective Time.

(iii)  _Section 16_. The Company Board shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, any deemed disposition and
cancellation of the Company Options in the Merger.

(b) _Company ESPP_. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP (each, a "
_Purchase Right_ ") shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive at the Effective Time from Parent, for each share of Company
Common Stock issuable under such Purchase Right, an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable to the holder of such Purchase Right
had such Purchase Right been exercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the
purchase price under such Purchase Right. Within five (5) days following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to return to participants
their respective accumulated payroll contributions not applied to the purchase
of Company Common Stock under the Company ESPP, if any. Parent agrees that
from and after the Effective Time, without application of any waiting period
for new employees or similar provision, Continuing Employees may participate
in Parents employee stock purchase plan, if any, subject to the terms and
conditions of such plan.

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately
preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group
of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  



 

-71-  The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of
the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be substantially
in the form contained in _Schedule 7.12(a)_ , and any material modifications
to such form shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent. The
Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any
such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably request.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all Continuing
Employees who become employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
to participate in the benefit programs of Parent or the Subsidiary to the
same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or the Subsidiary. In
the U.S., Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent shall be given
credit for all service with the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries solely for
purposes of determining their rate of vacation accrual under Parents standard
procedure, and for eligibility to participate in, and vesting of benefits
under, Parents 401(k) plan. Outside the U.S., Continuing Employees who
become employees of a Subsidiary of Parent shall be given credit for service
with the Company or its Subsidiaries solely as required by applicable Legal
Requirements. Unused vacation days accrued by U.S. Continuing Employees under
the plans and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall carry over to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the extent administratively
practicable, and each such Continuing Employee shall be paid by the
Company in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days that Parent
determines are not administratively practicable to continue to honor.

(c) Subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable Legal Requirements, the
Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation, deferred
compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case as of the
day immediately preceding the last day of the initial period of the Offer (not
including any subsequent offer period provided by Parent pursuant to Rule
14d-11 of the Exchange Act). The Company shall provide Parent evidence that
such plans that may be terminated under applicable Legal Requirements have
been so terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board
of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of
which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent).

7.13 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in
effect immediately prior to the Appointment Time between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Appointment Time (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") with respect to any Legal Proceeding commenced during the period
commencing with the Appointment Time and ending six (6) years following the
Effective Time. In addition, for the period commencing with the Appointment
Time and ending six  



 

-72-  (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are
at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time, and during such
period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who were covered by such provisions, except as required by
Legal Requirements.

(b) For the period commencing with the Appointment Time and ending six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO
Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time, on terms and conditions
(including with respect to the coverage and amounts) no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
may, at their option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms and
conditions (including with respect to coverage and amounts) no less favorable,
in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO Insurance and from a carrier
having the same or better rating as the carrier of the DandO Insurance; 
_provided, however_ , that in satisfying their obligations under this _Section
7.13(b)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of the amount set forth on _Schedule 7.13(b)_
 hereto (such amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "), _provided_ that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Appointment Time, in lieu of the foregoing and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
may (or may request that the Company, in which case the Company shall)
purchase a "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance for the period
commencing with the Appointment Time and ending six years following the
Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than the DandO Insurance from a carrier having the same or better rating as the
carrier of the DandO Insurance. In the event that Parent (or the Company, at
Parents request) shall purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Appointment Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 7.13(b)_, for
so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer  



 

-73-  all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 7.13_.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred
to in _Section 7.13(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.13_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.13(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 7.13_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable
Legal Requirements (whether at law or in equity).

(e) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this Section 7.13 shall be joint and
several.

7.14 _FIRPTA Certificate_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

7.15 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

Company to consummate the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (where permissible under applicable law) prior to the Effective Time,

Stockholders is required by Delaware Law, the Requisite Stockholder Approval

have) the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of
the Merger.

any required extensions of the Offer pursuant to the terms hereof) in
accordance with the terms hereof without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger

(ii) in the expiration or termination of the Offer (subject to any required
extensions of the Offer pursuant to the terms hereof) in accordance with the
terms hereof without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) having

such case, such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement; or

Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or (B) that any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become
inaccurate, in either case so as would prevent, or would be reasonably likely
to prevent, Parent and Merger Sub from consummating the Offer in accordance
with the terms hereof; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that such breach by Parent or Merger Sub or
such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger
Sub are curable by Parent or Merger Sub through the exercise of commercially

inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Sub is cured within such thirty (30) calendar
day period); or

Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the

which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms.

9.4 Fees and Expenses.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.5(b)_ and _Section

the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ or  _Section 9.1(c)_ or (2) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(i)_, (B)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement (in the case of any termination referred to in
clause (A)(1) above) or prior to the breach or inaccuracy that forms the basis
for the termination of this Agreement (in the case of any termination referred
to in clause (A)(2) above), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly

"forty percent (40%)" for purposes of this definition of a "Company
Acquisition Transaction" and (ii) the reference to "eighty five percent (85%)"
in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to be "sixty
percent (60%)" for purposes of this definition of a "Company Acquisition

provisions of _Section 9.4(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), and that,
without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts
due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent makes a claim against the Company (i) that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable costs and

provisions of this Agreement (including _Section 2.3(c)_), this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in

by the Company Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment
shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of such

parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall  



 

-80-  be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of

[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER] _ANNEX A_

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to compliance
with _Section 2.1_ of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
February 7, 2007 (the " _Agreement_ ") by and among Polycom, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Spyglass Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
SpectraLink Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ")
(capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in this Annex A
shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement), and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) the rights and obligations of Merger
Sub to extend and/or amend the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement, Merger Sub (i) shall not be required to accept for payment or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Merger Sub to
pay for or return tendered Company Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer)), pay for any tendered Company Shares and (ii) may
delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred
to above, the payment for, any tendered Company Shares, in the event that at
or prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ of the Agreement) if: (A) (x) any waiting period
(and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the HSR Act shall not
have expired or been terminated and (y) all other antitrust, competition or
merger control consents reasonably deemed necessary by Parent to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) shall not have been received (or been deemed to have been received by
virtue of the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period),
either unconditionally or on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (B) the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, or (C) any of the following
shall have occurred:

(1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement (i) shall not have been true and correct in all respects as of the
date of the Agreement or (ii) shall not be true and correct in all respects on
and as of the expiration date of the Offer with the same force and effect as
if made on and as of such date, except, (A) in the case of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), for any failure to be so true and correct as
has not had and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided, however_ , that such
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifier shall be inapplicable with respect
to representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_, _Section
4.3_, _Sections 4.4(a), 4.4(b) and 4.4(c)_ of the Agreement (collectively,
the " _Special Representations_ "), each of which individually shall be true
and correct in all material respects on and as of the expiration date of the
Offer, (B) for changes contemplated by this Agreement and (C) for
those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
particular date (which representations shall have been true and correct as of
such particular date except as is not reasonably likely to have a Company  



 

A-1  Material Adverse Effect); and _provided further_ that, for purposes of
determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in the Agreement for purposes of this clause (C)(1), (i) all
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and materiality qualifications and other
qualifications based on the word "material" or similar phrases contained in
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded (it being understood
and hereby agreed that (x) the phrase "similar phrases" as used in this
proviso shall not be deemed to include any dollar thresholds contained in any
such representations and warranties and (y) the representation and warranty
set forth in _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Agreement shall not be disregarded
pursuant to the terms of this proviso) and (ii) any update of or modification
to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after
the date of the Agreement shall be disregarded;

(2) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any covenant or other
agreement of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the
Agreement;

(3) there shall be pending or overtly threatened any suit, action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (i) challenging the acquisition by
Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) of any Company Shares pursuant
to the Offer, seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or the performance of any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Tender and Voting Agreements (including
the voting provisions thereunder), (ii) seeking to impose material limitations
on the ability of Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf), or render
Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) unable, to accept for payment,
pay for or purchase some or all of the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer
and the Merger, (iii) seeking to prohibit or impose any limitations on the
ownership or operation by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) of all or any
portion of businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
with Parents voice business segment, or to compel Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any portion of
the businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in any such case in a manner that would be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole with Parents voice
business segment, (iv) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of
the Company Shares, including the right to vote the Company Shares purchased
by it on all matters properly presented to the Company Stockholders or (v)
which otherwise would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

(4) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have (i)
enacted, issued, promulgated, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer or the
Merger) any law, statute, rule or regulation that is in effect and has the
effect of making the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) illegal or which has the
effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the  



 

A-2  consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), (ii) issued or granted, or
overtly threatened to issue or grant, any judgment, Order or injunction
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and has (or
would be reasonably expected to have) the effect of making any of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) illegal or which has (or would be reasonably expected to have) the
effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) or (iii) taken or overtly threatened any other action that would be
reasonably expected to have any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i)
through (v), inclusive, of the immediately preceding paragraph (C)(3) of this
_Annex A_ ;

(5) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred following the
execution and delivery of the Agreement (whether or not events or
circumstances occurring prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
caused or contributed to the occurrence of such Company Material Adverse
Effect) and continue to exist;

(6) any Triggering Event shall have occurred; or

(7) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by
Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub. The failure by Parent or Merger
Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
