The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 Section 1.06 _ Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.  

  

 (a) The parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

 (b) The parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary so that the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly appointed, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

    
ARTICLE II 
CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

    Section 2.01 _ Effect on Capital Stock. _ At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or
any capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

    
 (a) _ Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. _ Each share of Company Common Stock (a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or 

        

indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and each Share owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (and
in each case not held on behalf of third parties) (each such Share being a "
_Cancelled Share_ " and collectively, " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

    
 (b) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock. _ Each Share (other than Cancelled Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, subject to _Sections 2.02(b)(v)_ and _2.02(h)_ , 0.365 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of common stock, par value $0.001, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ " which, for avoidance of doubt shall include the Fractional Share Consideration (as defined in _Section 2.02(b)(v)_)). From and after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.02(h)_, all of such Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") representing any Shares (other than Cancelled Shares), if any, and each non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") (other than Cancelled Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

    
 (c) _ Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. _ Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
 Section 2.02 _ Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.  

  

    
 (a) _ Exchange Agent. _ Prior to the Closing, Parent shall select and engage an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with such Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration (which, for purposes of this _Section 2.02(a)_, shall not include the Fractional Share Consideration) (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued) and cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

    
 (b) _ Procedures for Surrender_.  

  

  

 (i) _ Certificates._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after consultation with the Company; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.02(g)_). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.02(g) _) to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with respect to such Certificates, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.02(f)_) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_. Any 

  

      

  

surrendered Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, as
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (ii) _ Book-Entry Shares._ Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu thereof, each such holder shall, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent\'s message" (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.02(f) _) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (iii) _ Transfer of Shares._ If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. 

  

 (iv) _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received in respect thereof, until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share receiving whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor will be paid, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (v) _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificate or scrip or shares representing fractional Parent Common Stock (whether certificated or book-entry shares) shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in 

  

      

  

lieu thereof, cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent and without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the
Parent Trading Price (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ ").

  

  

    
 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer Books. _ As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than registrations of transfers to reflect, with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and, subject to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_, exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, except as otherwise required by law. 

  

    
 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property. _ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of the Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

    
 (e) _ No Liability. _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 2.02 (d)_, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.02(g)_) shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

    
 (f) _ Withholding Rights. _ Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to, or in accordance with, this Agreement to any person such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be (i) remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) to the extent remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with subpart (i), treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

   

    
 (g) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. _ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or 

        

the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue, or pay or cause to be paid, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on such
Certificate, in each case deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

  

    
 (h) _ Adjustments to Merger Consideration. _ In the event that the Company or Parent changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, subdivision, exchange or readjustment of shares, or other similar transaction, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of Parent Common Stock, or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.02(h)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 2.03 _ Treatment of Company Equity Awards. _ The Company will adopt resolutions, and take such other actions as are reasonably necessary to effect the following: 

  

    
 (a) _ Assumption of Company Stock Options_.  

  

  

 (i) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an option (an " _Assumed Stock Option_ ") to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock applicable to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. Except as provided above, each Assumed Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Employee Stock Plan and option agreements will be references to Parent. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall no longer represent the right to acquire Company Common Stock. It is the intent of the parties hereto that to the extent permitted by applicable laws, the assumption of each Company Stock Option shall be performed in a manner that is in material compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (and applicable regulations thereunder) or, to the extent such Company Stock Option is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option, Section 424(a) of the Code (and applicable regulations thereunder). 

  

 (ii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holder of each Company Stock Option appropriate notices setting forth the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Stock Option then held by such holder and the exercise price under each such Assumed Stock Option, each as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)(i)_ hereof. 

  

  

    
 (b) _ Assumption of Company Restricted Stock Units. _ At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof) that becomes vested prior to or as a result of the consummation of the Merger and is settled in Shares that, in turn, converts into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01_) shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into the 

        

right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio;
provided, that such right shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including vesting, payment and withholding provisions) as were applicable to
the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that all references to the "Company" in the
applicable Company Employee Stock Plans and restricted stock unit agreements
will be references to Parent). From and after the Effective Time, each such
Company Restricted Stock Unit shall no longer represent the right to acquire
any Company Common Stock.

  

    
 (c) _ Treatment of Company ESPP. _ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall: (i) cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) in progress under the Company ESPP immediately prior to the Closing to be the final offering period under the Company ESPP and to be terminated no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date and no earlier than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) cause each participant\'s then-outstanding share purchase right under the Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; and (iv) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each share purchased thereunder prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_, subject to withholding of any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section 2.03(c)_), be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). No further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice to participants of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the Company ESPP. 

  

    
 Section 2.04 _ Company Equity Awards Assumed by Parent; Parent Actions. _ At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under the Company Employee Stock Plans in respect of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units, and shall assume such outstanding awards and the obligations under the agreements evidencing such awards. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon settlement of the assumed Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units in accordance with _Section 2.03_. Promptly after the Closing Date (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall file or otherwise have available a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the assumed Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units. 

       

                                    

    

    
 Section 2.05 _ Company Warrants_.  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Outstanding Warrant (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a warrant (an " _Assumed Warrant_ ") to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Warrant shall be equal (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock applicable to such Outstanding Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. Except as provided above, the Assumed Warrant shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding Outstanding Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the "Company" in the applicable Outstanding Warrant will be references to Parent. From and after the Effective Time, each Outstanding Warrant shall no longer represent the right to acquire Company Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holder of each Outstanding Warrant appropriate notices setting forth the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Assumed Warrant then held by each such holder and the exercise price under each such Assumed Warrant, each as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_ hereof. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, each Converted Warrant (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Converted Warrant _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio _minus_ (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate exercise price of such Converted Warrant by the Parent Trading Price (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). No certificate or scrip or shares representing fractional Parent Common Stock (whether certificated or book-entry shares) shall be issued in connection with the Warrant Consideration, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of a Converted Warrant cancelled and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.05(c)_ who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent and without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the Parent Trading Price (the " _Warrant Fractional Share Consideration_ "). After the Effective Time each holder of a Converted Warrant shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Converted Warrant except the rights provided in this Section 2.05(c). At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall issue and pay, or deposit with the Exchange Agent and cause the Exchange Agent to deliver and pay, to the holder of each Converted Warrant the applicable Warrant Consideration and Warrant Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.05(c)_. 

  

    
 Section 2.06 _ Tax Treatment. _ It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) above (A) such Company
Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.04_, (B)

businesses or assets that constitute less than 85% of the consolidated revenue
or assets of the Company or (v) any liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company. The Company agrees that in the event any

in clauses (i) or (iii) above, a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ").

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, effect a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_ in respect of a Company Takeover Proposal if (and only if): (A) a written Company Takeover Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and has not been withdrawn; (B) such Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 4.04_; (C) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that (1) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (2) failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law; (D) the Company provides Parent four Business Days\' (the " _Recommendation Change Notice Period_ ") prior written notice that if at the expiration of the Recommendation Change Notice Period, such Company Takeover Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal, it intends to take such action (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which notice shall include the Proposal Information (it being understood that (x) such Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement and (y) any material revision or amendment to the terms of any Company Superior Proposal (including, any change to the pricing thereof) shall require a new Recommendation Change Notice, except that the Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be reduced to two Business Days after the initial Recommendation Change Notice Period); (E) during the Recommendation Change Notice Period, the Company gives Parent the opportunity to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or to make a new proposal) and negotiates in good faith with Parent and its Representatives, if requested by Parent, regarding any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement or with respect to Parent\'s new proposal; and (F) at the end of the Recommendation Change Notice Period (and any subsequent Recommendation Change Notice Periods), the Company Board again makes the determination in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into account any adjustments or modifications proposed by Parent during any Recommendation Change Notice Period), (1) that such Company Takeover Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal and (2) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, effect a Company Change of Recommendation in respect of an Intervening Event if (and only if): (A) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing; (B) such Intervening Event did not result from a breach of _Section 4.04_; (C) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that (1) such Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (2) failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties under applicable law; (D) the Company provides Parent prior written notice equal to the Recommendation Change Notice Period that if at the expiration of the Recommendation Change Notice Period, such Intervening Event is continuing, it intends to take such action (a " _Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which notice shall include a reasonable summary of the Intervening Event (it being understood that (x) such Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement and (y) any material change to the status of the Intervening Event shall require a new Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice, 

        

except that the Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be reduced to two
Business Days after the initial Recommendation Change Notice Period); (E)
during the Recommendation Change Notice Period, the Company gives Parent the
opportunity to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or to make a
new proposal) and negotiates in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives, if requested by Parent, regarding any adjustments or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement or with respect to Parent\'s new
proposal; and (F) at the end of the Recommendation Change Notice Period (and
any subsequent Recommendation Change Notice Periods), the Company Board again
makes the determination in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into account any
adjustments or modifications proposed by Parent during any Recommendation
Change Notice Period), (1) that such Intervening Event is continuing
and remains in effect and (2) that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Proxy/S-4 with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger, which will include the Proxy Statement with respect to the Company Special Meeting, with such filings to be made as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company in good faith. Prior to the Form S-4 being declared effective, (1) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver to Company\'s Counsel and to Parent\'s Counsel the applicable "Tax Representation Letter" referenced in _Section 5.14(b) _; and (2) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver to Parent\'s Counsel and to Company\'s Counsel the applicable "Tax Representation Letter" referenced in _Section 5.14(b)_.

In rendering such opinions, Company\'s Counsel and Parent\'s Counsel shall each be entitled to rely on the Tax Representation Letters referred to in this _Section 5.01_ and _Section 5.14(b)_. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Proxy/S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Proxy/S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Proxy/S-4 effective for so long as is necessary to complete the Merger. The Company shall furnish all information concerning itself, its affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy/S-4 and the Proxy Statement. The Proxy/S-4 and the Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other party to be included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy/S-4 or the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Proxy/S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Proxy/S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Proxy/S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Proxy/S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response). Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Proxy/S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action required to be taken by it under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, 

        

any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Shares as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions. The Company agrees
that no matters shall be brought before the Company Special Meeting other
than the proposal to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the related
"golden parachute" vote under Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and any
related and customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn the
meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval). The Company shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and
proxy tallies following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the
holders of the Shares; _provided_ , that the Company shall, upon the request
of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable proxy
solicitor of the Company to advise Parent on a not less than daily basis
during the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company
Special Meeting as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.

  

 (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates is discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy/S-4 and/or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Proxy/S-4 and, to the extent required by law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 5.01(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 5.01(a) _. For purposes of this _Section 5.01_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent. 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the Proxy/S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders entitled to vote at the Company Special Meeting, and shall cause the Company Special Meeting to be held as soon as reasonably practicable following such mailing (but in no event more than the longer of 30 days or 20 Business Days after the date of such mailing). 

   

 (d) The Company shall (i) take all necessary actions to establish a record date for, and to duly call, give notice of, and convene the Company Special Meeting in accordance with applicable law and the Company certificate of incorporation and by-laws and (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, maintain such Company Board Recommendation and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; except in the case of clause (ii) to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Company Change of Recommendation as permitted by (and solely pursuant to the terms of) _Section 4.04_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company\'s obligation to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, and convene the Company Special Meeting in accordance with this _Section 5.01(d)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Company Takeover Proposal or Company Superior Proposal, by the occurrence of an Intervening Event or by any Company Change of Recommendation. 

  

 (e) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient Shares, represented (either in person 

        

or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval and, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have made a Company Change of Recommendation as permitted by (and solely
pursuant to the terms of) _Section 4.04_, the Company shall continue to use
all reasonable best efforts to assist in the solicitation of proxies
from stockholders relating to the Company Stockholder Approval.

Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this _Section 5.02_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Any investigation shall be subject to Company\'s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include invasive testing. 

  

 (b) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. All information provided pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_ shall be subject to the applicable terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Without limiting the foregoing or the provisions set forth in _Section 5.03(b)_ (and subject to the terms and limitations in _Section 5.03(b)_), each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date. 

  

 (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide any supplemental information that reasonably may be requested by applicable Governmental Authorities relating thereto. Each of the Company and Parent shall consult with one another (and their respective advisers) as to the form and content of any notification and report form, filing, or supplemental information supplied to any Governmental Authority, and allow the Company or Parent, as applicable (and their respective advisers) to review the same (as may be redacted to remove any estimate of the valuation of the Company, its business or shares, or to preserve any applicable privilege) in advance of submission and make such amendments as either may reasonably request. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable Governmental Authority and shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any such inquiry or request and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide any supplemental information reasonably requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act, and, to the extent permitted by any Governmental Authority: (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, inform each party prior to all material communications (including material telephone calls and meetings) with a Governmental Authority, (ii) allow either party the opportunity to participate in any such calls and meetings to the extent reasonably practicable, and (iii) allow each party (and their respective advisers) to review any material written communications before submission and to make such amendments to such communications as either the Company or Parent may reasonably request.

Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to a request for an early termination of the waiting period thereunder. Parent shall pay the HSR filing fee. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall require Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates (A) to propose, commit, offer to commit or otherwise effect, by undertaking, consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, to the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or the Company Joint Ventures, or otherwise offer or commit to take any action (including any action that limits the freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or ability to retain or hold, any of the business, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or the Company Joint Ventures), (B) to oppose any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against the Merger or any portion thereof, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, or to take any steps to have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned, 

        

avoided, eliminated or removed any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or (C) to agree to or take
any action that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on Parent or the Company and their respective subsidiaries and
affiliates, taken as a whole, following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not agree to take, or take, any of the
actions contemplated by clauses (A) through (C) immediately above without the
prior written consent of Parent.

  

 (d) None of the parties shall knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken or omit to take any action which such party reasonably expects is likely to delay past the Termination Date or prevent consummation of the Merger, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. 

  

 (e) In addition to the obligations under _Section 5.03(b)_, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from third parties, including Governmental Authorities (other than pursuant to efforts with respect to the HSR Act referenced in _Section 5.03(b) _), necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of the Merger and to provide, and cooperate in providing, notices to, and make or file, and cooperate in the making or filing of, registrations, declarations or filings with, third parties required to be provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be required to pay or commit to pay any significant amount to (or incur any significant liability or obligation in favor of) any third party that is not a Governmental Authority from whom any such Consent, notice, registration, declaration or filing may be required (other than nominal filing or application fees). 

  

 (f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing subsections of _Section 5.03_, the Company shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law (and together with any other anti-takeover provision set forth in the Company\'s certificate of incorporation or its bylaws, the " _Takeover Provisions_ "), or Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any Takeover Law or Takeover Provision becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law or Takeover Provision on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 5.04 _ Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.  

  

 (a) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers of the Company, as provided in its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other agreements providing indemnification, advancement or exculpation, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, that Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all such rights and that for six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, no such provision in any certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational document) or other agreement shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder to any such individual with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain or obtain directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s respective directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in amounts no less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the relevant 

        

policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the annual
cost thereof shall not exceed 300% of the annual cost of such policies as
of the date of this Agreement. If such insurance coverage cannot be
maintained for such cost, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors\' and officers\' insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company
Indemnified Parties than the existing directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by the Company, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the aggregate cost
thereof shall not exceed 300% of the annual cost of the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of
this Agreement as set forth in _Section 5.04(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, it shall satisfy the obligations set forth in the first
two sentences of this paragraph (b). Parent may, at its sole discretion,
purchase a "tail" insurance policy with respect to the Company\'s employment
practice liability, fiduciary liability, cyber liability, product liability
and any other insurance coverage for liability and, if Parent determines to
purchase such insurance policy or policies, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in obtaining such policy or policies on terms and conditions acceptable
to Parent, it being understood that the costs of all such tail policies shall
be borne by Parent.

  

 (c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present director and officer of the Company (in each case, for acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of the date of this Agreement, and any person who becomes such a director or officer between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, amounts paid in settlement, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses) to such persons as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; _provided_ , that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 5.04_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and, from and after the Effective Time, will be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for or in limitation of, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

 (e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.04_. 

  

    
 Section 5.05 _ Fees and Expenses. _ Except as provided in this _Section 5.05_, and _Section 7.03_, and whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

        

    
 Section 5.06 _ Public Announcements. _ Except (A) as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case, to the extent reasonably practicable and as permitted by applicable law, reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party hereto shall be made prior to any such release or public statement or (B) in connection with any actions by the Company or Company Board permitted by _Section 4.04(e)_ or in connection with any Company Superior Proposal received by the Company, or Parent\'s response thereto, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their subsidiaries to, consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except for any public statement or press release as may be required by applicable law, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any listing agreement with or rule of the NYSE or Nasdaq, shall not, and shall cause their subsidiaries not to, issue any such press release, make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call before that consultation and providing each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any such press release or public statement.

Parent shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to participate in (but not control) the defense of such litigation and, in any event, the Company shall not settle, compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to settle, compromise or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation, without Parent\'s prior written consent. 

   

    
 Section 5.08 _ Section 16 Matters. _ Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall, as applicable, be entitled to take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 (b) Prior to the Closing, upon Parent\'s request, the Company shall take all reasonable actions to cause the delisting of Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the termination of the Company\'s registration under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

    
 Section 5.10 _ Resignations. _ The Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective Time. 

  

    
 Section 5.11 _ Employee Matters. _ 

  

 (a) The Company Board shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company, unless Parent provides written notice to the Company at least three 

        

Business Days prior to the Effective Time that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not
be terminated. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k)
plan(s) of the Company have been terminated pursuant to such resolutions of
the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject
to the reasonable review and approval of Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who
were eligible to participate in any 401(k) plan maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parent\'s
401(k) plan, and shall permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to
transfer his or her account balance when distributed from any terminated
401(k) plan maintained by the Company, including any outstanding participant
loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parent\'s 401(k) plan, except to the extent
accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified status of
the Parent 401(k) plan, or as may be prohibited by Parent\'s 401(k) plan.

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to participate in the employee benefit programs of Parent or the applicable subsidiary to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or such applicable subsidiary. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause any subsidiary of Parent, including the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company of Continuing Employees in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or policies of Parent or its subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of level of benefits (including vacation), including applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical benefit plan or any other benefit plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent do not receive credit for prior service, or to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits or was not relevant for any such purpose under the corresponding Company Employee Benefit Plan).

Governmental Authority. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-
occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition set forth in _Section 6.02_ not to be satisfied at any time from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; and (ii) any notice or
other communication from any third person alleging that the consent of such
third person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto hereunder. The Company

Substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent will repay and discharge (or provide the funds to the Company to repay and discharge) the Payoff Amount in accordance with the Payoff Letter. 

  

    
 Section 5.14 _ Certain Tax Matters_.  

  

 (a) None of the parties hereto shall (and each party shall cause its respective subsidiaries not to) knowingly take any action (or knowingly fail to take any reasonable action) which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise required by a determination as such term is used in Section 1313 of the Code, shall report, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the parties hereto shall take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with the characterization of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code except to the extent otherwise required by a determination as such term is used in Section 1313 of the Code. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to, and cause their subsidiaries to, deliver to O\'Melveny and Myers LLP (" _Parent\'s Counsel_ ") and Cooley LLP (" _Company\'s Counsel_ "), at such time or times as requested by the Company\'s Counsel or Parent\'s Counsel, a letter (such letters, the " _Tax Representation Letters_ ") signed by an officer of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, with respect to Parent and Merger Sub, that is substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit C_, and, with respect to the Company, that is substantially 

        

in the form set forth in _Exhibit D_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the opinion of the Company\'s Counsel referred to in
_Section 6.02(d)_. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to, and cause their subsidiaries to, obtain the opinion of Parent\'s
Counsel referred to in _Section 6.03(d)_.
