Section 2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective

the Company with all its properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective Time,
the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without

_Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at the offices of White and Case LLP, 1221
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020, at 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the third (3rd) Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE IX_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) in accordance with this Agreement
or (b) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company
and Parent may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Marketing Period has commenced but has not completed at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE
IX_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions),
the parties shall not be required to effect the Closing until the earlier of
(i) a Business Day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less
than three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the
third (3rd) Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in

 



      
 

 



 

such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
or at such later date and time as the Company and Parent may agree upon and
specified in such Certificate of Merger (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

Section 3.1 _Certificate_ _of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety at the Effective
Time to be in the form of _Exhibit A_, and, as so amended and restated, such

Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Charter_ ") until, subject to _Section
8.8_, thereafter amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 3.2 _By-Laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law, except that the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as of the Effective Time
to change the name of the Surviving Corporation as used therein to a name to
be mutually agreed by the parties and to contain such provisions as are
necessary to give full effect to _Section 3.1_ (the " _By-Laws_ ").

 



 

Section 3.3 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to Applicable Law, from and
after the Effective Time, (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b)
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



 

Section 4.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Common Shares held by
Parent or Merger Sub or held by the Company as treasury stock (" _Excluded
Shares_ "), (ii) Common Shares held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or
Parent (other than Merger Sub) and (iii) Common Shares with respect to which
the holder thereof is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and shall have properly complied with the provisions of the DGCL as to
appraisal rights with respect to such Common Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ "))
shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with this _ARTICLE
IV_, $65.00 in

 



      
 

 



 

cash, without interest (the per share cash consideration to be paid to the
holders of such Common Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Common Shares_.

 



 

(i) Each Common Share converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (A)
each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Common Shares (each, a " _Certificated
Share_ "), (B) each uncertificated Common Share registered to a holder in the
Companys electronic direct registration system immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") and (C) each book-entry
account that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
uncertificated Common Shares held of record by The Depository Trust Company ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than Certificated Shares, Uncertificated Shares
or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, representing Excluded Shares, Dissenting
Shares or Common Shares described in _Section 4.1(b)(iii)_ below, shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 4.2(d)_) representing such Certificated Shares or
transfer of any such Uncertificated Shares or any such Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _ARTICLE IV_. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of any Certificate or the transfer of any Uncertificated Share or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Certificated Share, Uncertificated Share or Book-
Entry Share and the Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

 



 

(ii) Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration in exchange therefor or in respect thereof and shall cease to
exist.

 



 

(iii) Each Common Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one (1) newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
and, except as provided in _Section 4.1(b)(iii)_, shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Common Shares for Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent and Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). At or immediately following (on the Closing Date) the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, separate and apart from its other funds, for the benefit of
holders of Certificated Shares, Uncertificated Shares and Book-Entry Shares,
cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration which such
holders collectively are entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_
(such cash, the " _Merger Fund_ "). Parent shall direct the Merger Fund to be
(i) held for the benefit of the holders of Certificated Shares, Uncertificated
Shares and Book-Entry Shares and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_. The Merger Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_. Parent
shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

 



 

(ii) The Merger Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (A) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (B) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for payment of all principal and interest or (C) commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better from Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors, a division of SandP Global, respectively, in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of any such bank that are then publicly available), or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months, as directed by Parent and for the benefit of the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Common Shares following
completion of the Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_ or otherwise relieve
Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _ARTICLE
IV_, and Parent, prior to the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation,
from and after the Effective Time, shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that the Merger Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parents
obligation under this _ARTICLE IV_. Any and all interest and other income
earned on the Merger Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, at Parents election.

 



 

(iii) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of Certificated Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded
Shares, Dissenting Shares and Common Shares described in _Section
4.1(b)(iii)_) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form as
agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificated
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(d))_ to the
Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(d)_) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iv) Upon physical surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(d)_), together with a duly completed and
validly

 



      
 

 



 

executed letter of transmittal and other required documents, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal and instructions
thereto, to the Paying Agent, the holder of the Certificated Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 4.2(d)_) shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
direct the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange therefor, cash in an amount equal
to the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days of receipt by the
Paying Agent of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 4.2(d)_) and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(d)_).

 



 

(v) No holder of Uncertificated Shares or Book-Entry Shares shall be required
to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of one (1)
or more Uncertificated Shares and/or Book-Entry Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive, and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to each such holder
(other than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of his, her or its Common
Shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_. If required by the Paying Agent, such
payments shall be subject to receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form, together with such other documents, certifications
or other information, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request (it
being understood that holders of Uncertificated Shares or Book-Entry Shares
shall be deemed to have surrendered such Common Shares upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of such "agents message" and other evidence, documents,
certificates or other information, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request). No interest will be paid or accrue on any amount payable upon due
transfer of Uncertificated Shares or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(vi) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Common Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Common Shares so surrendered is
or are registered if such Common Shares shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(b) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be marked canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _ARTICLE IV_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains
unclaimed by the former holders of Common Shares and other eligible Persons in
accordance with this _ARTICLE IV_ following one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such
holder or eligible Person who has not previously complied with this _ARTICLE
IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (and not to Parent
or any Affiliate of Parent), and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable, for payment of any such holders or eligible Persons claim for the
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such terms as may be
reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such
certificate hereunder (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be
deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares
for purposes of this _ARTICLE IV_.

 



 

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Common Shares, Warrants, Options, Restricted Stock Units or
Performance Stock Units such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent and then remitted to the relevant Taxing Authority on behalf
of the former holder of Common Shares, Warrants, Options, Restricted Stock
Units or Performance Stock Units, such withheld and remitted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of Common Shares, Warrants, Options, Restricted Stock Units or
Performance Stock Units in respect of which such deduction, withholding and
remittance to the relevant Taxing Authority was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall cooperate with each other and with the
former holders of Common Shares, Warrants, Options, Restricted Stock Units or
Performance Stock Units in the collection, preparation and filing of any forms
or other documentation relating to any claim of exemption or relief from any
requirement to withhold so as to eliminate or minimize to the greatest extent
possible any such requirement, to the extent such cooperation does not involve
unreasonable effort or expense.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such
time at which such amounts would otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Treatment of Options, R_ _estricted Stock Units and Performance
Stock Units_.

 



 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of
any Common Shares or Options, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying
(i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price per share of such Option by (ii) the number of Common Shares
subject to such Option. For the avoidance of doubt, any Option which has an
exercise price per Common Share that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment.

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any holder of any Common Shares or Restricted Stock Units, each Restricted
Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested
or unvested) shall be fully vested and shall be canceled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_
with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (i) the Merger
Consideration by (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to such Restricted
Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Performance Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any holder of any Common Shares or Performance Stock Units, each
Performance Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested and shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section
4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (i) the Merger
Consideration by (ii) (A) in the case of unvested Performance Stock Units, the
number of Common Shares subject to such Performance Stock Unit as set forth in
the applicable award agreement or (B) in the case of vested Performance Stock
Units, the number of Common Shares subject to such Performance Stock Unit
based on the actual level of achievement of performance goals in accordance
with the terms of the applicable award agreement.

 



 

(d) Unless a later time for payment is expressly required under the terms of
an applicable Company Equity Plan, equity award agreement or Performance Stock
Unit deferral agreement, and only to the extent that the timing of such
payment would not result in a violation of Section 409A of the Code, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Options, Restricted Stock Units
and Performance Stock Units the cash payments described in this _Section
4.3_, including any dividends or dividend equivalent rights accrued under any

 



      
 

 



 

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units, promptly after the
Effective Time, but in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day
after the Effective Time. If a later time of payment is required under the
terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan, equity award agreement,
Performance Stock Unit deferral agreement and/or Section 409A of the Code,
then payment shall be made at the earliest time provided and allowed
thereunder. All of the actions described in this _Section 4.3_ shall be made
in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(e) All payments in respect of Options, Restricted Stock Units or Performance
Stock Units and any dividends or dividend equivalent rights on such awards
shall be subject to all applicable withholding in accordance with _Section
4.2(e)_.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any Common Shares or Warrants, each Warrant that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not such
Warrant is then exercisable) shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to
such payment) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such Warrant by
(ii) the number of Common Shares subject to such Warrant.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Appraisal_ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_, but rather,
the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , that, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in _Section
4.1(a)_. The Company shall give Parent notice of any written demands for
appraisal of Common Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL, in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable after its
receipt of notice thereof, and the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal in
respect of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, at any time
during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company
changes the number of

 



      
 

 



 

Common Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares, merger, issuer tender offer or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Common Shares, then the Merger Consideration shall
be appropriately equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of
Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such change; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.6_ shall be
construed to permit the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person to
take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) If at any time before or after the Effective Time, Parent or the Company
reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds,
assignments, actions or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors or
managers shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, but subject in all respects
to _Section 8.5_ and without limiting any of the parties other obligations
under this Agreement, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
identify and obtain any consents, clearances, expiration of waiting periods,
approvals, waivers, amendments, licenses, Permits, franchises, certificates,
registrations, variations, exemptions and authorizations of, and actions or
non-actions by, and all filings, submission declarations with, any
Governmental Entity or third party).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, and subject in all respects to _Section
8.1_ and _Section 8.14_, in each case, at Parents request:

 



 

(i) the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to planning the integration of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries with Parent and its Subsidiaries, including with
respect to identifying strategic and operational matters for integration and
consulting and cooperating with Parent and Merger Sub in connection therewith
to the extent such consultation and cooperation are not in violation of
antitrust and other Applicable Laws; and

 



 

(ii) the Company, at Parents sole cost and expense, will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to facilitate the
issuance of a buy-side representation and warranty insurance policy, including

accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting utilized by the Company which is reasonably likely to
adversely affect the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; or (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the
management or other employees of the Company or any of the Company

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable
assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
applicable rules, regulations and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely

Financing Commitments

 



      
 

 



 

have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters
(complete copies of which have been provided to the Company, with only fee
amounts, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms redacted;
_provided_ that Parent represents and warrants that the "market flex"
provisions and other redacted terms in such fee letters do not permit the

Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing
and available cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries)) and customary engagement letters and fee credit letters
with respect to the Debt Financing (none of which reduces the amount of the
Debt Financing below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after
taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of
Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or
adversely affects the conditionality, enforceability, termination or
availability of the Debt Financing), as of the date hereof, there are no side
letters or contracts or other arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party that impose conditions to, affect the availability of or modify, amend
or expand the conditions to the funding of the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees in
connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the
date hereof and Parent will continue to pay in full any such amounts required
to be paid as and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing
Date. As of the date hereof, each of the Equity Financing Commitments, in the
form so delivered, is in full force and effect, and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the parties thereto, except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles. As of the date hereof, each
of the Debt Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by
general equity principles. As of the date hereof, no party to any Financing
Commitment has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate the

forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company prior to the date
hereof (including any "market flex" provisions applicable to the Financing
Commitments). As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i)
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any term of or condition to
any of the Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) result in any
portion of the Financing Commitments being unavailable on the Closing Date. As
of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition of closing to be satisfied by it pursuant to the Financing
Commitments or that the full amount of the Financing will not be made
available to Parent on the Closing Date if the conditions thereto

 



      
 

 



 

are satisfied. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing
Commitments, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
assuming the Financing is funded and/or invested in accordance with the
Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date
sufficient funds to (A) pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the other
payments under _ARTICLE IV_, (B) pay any and all fees and expenses required
to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the Merger and the Financing, (C) pay for any refinancing of any
outstanding indebtedness of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Commitments) in full,
including all fees and expenses related thereto and (D) satisfy all of the
other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
contemplated hereunder ( _clauses (A)_ through _(D)_ , collectively, the "
_Financing Uses_ "). Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement
that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the Financing related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Ownership of Common Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, owns (beneficially or of record) any
Common Shares or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any Common
Shares. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, and at no time during the last five
(5) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such quoted
term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent.

any class or series of capital stock of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than Merger Sub) is necessary to approve this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The adoption of this Agreement by

approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger.

provided to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
information has been furnished to such Person (or its Representatives) and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Alternative Transaction Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 8.4(b)_, if there is one or more Exempted Persons
on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities
described in _Section 8.4(a)_ from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date
with respect to any such Exempted Person, including with respect to any
amended proposal submitted by any such Exempted Person, until the time that
such Exempted Person ceases to be an Exempted Person.

 



 

(c) On the No-Shop Period Start Date, except with respect to any Exempted
Person, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, any activities, solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Person and its Affiliates and Representatives (other than the parties and
their respective Representatives and designees) in connection with or relating
to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, in each case that exists as of the
date hereof. The Company also agrees that it will promptly after the No-Shop
Period Start Date (and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereof) (i)
request each Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives and designees) that has prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company to return or destroy all confidential information furnished to
such Person or any of its Affiliates or Representatives by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof and (ii)
terminate any access to any data room (electronic

 



      
 

 



 

or otherwise) previously provided to any such Person, its Affiliates or its or
their respective Representatives; provided, however, that with respect to
Exempted Persons, the request for the destruction or return of confidential
information shall be made promptly following such time as such Person ceases
to be an Exempted Person (and in any event within two (2) Business Days
thereof).

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.4_, the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withdraw (or
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) or publicly
propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) adopt
a formal resolution to recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (C) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business
Days of the occurrence of a bona fide material event or development following
the making of an Alternative Transaction Proposal and after Parent reasonably
requests in writing (or, if the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to
be held within ten (10) Business Days, within one (1) Business Day, if
possible, before the Company Stockholders Meeting), (D) make any
recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement (any action described in this _clause (i)_ being referred to
as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt or approve, or
publicly propose to adopt or approve, or cause, authorize or allow the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.4(b)_
(each, an " _Alternative Transaction Agreement_ ") (A) constituting or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to or otherwise relates to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but
subject to the Companys compliance in all material respects with the other
provisions of this _Section 8.4_, as applicable, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response
to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with
its legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Without limiting _Section 8.4(b)_, in response to a written Alternative
Transaction Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 8.4_
and that the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ and this
_Section 8.4(e)_ to, concurrently with such termination, enter into an
Alternative Transaction Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to _Section 10.1(h)_ and this _Section 8.4(e)_ unless the Company (i)
complies with its obligations set forth in _Section 8.4(f)_ and (ii) pays, or
causes to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to
_Section 10.3(a)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company Board shall not be entitled to either (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 8.4_ or (y) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ and _Section 8.4(e)_, unless (i) the
Company shall have provided to Parent three (3) Business Days prior written
notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, and
(A) if relating to a Superior Proposal, such notice shall contain the material
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action of the Company Board, including the identity of the Person or
"group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) making
such Alternative Transaction Proposal and a copy of such Alternative
Transaction Proposal or (B) if relating to an Intervening Event, such notice
shall contain the material facts and circumstances of such Intervening Event
and (ii) (A) during such three (3)-Business Day period, if requested by Parent
and so long as Parent continues to negotiate in good faith, the Company shall
have, and shall have used reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any
amendment to this Agreement or other agreements contemplated hereby proposed
in writing by Parent, (B) the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any adjustments to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms
hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably
offered in writing by Parent no later than the third (3rd) Business Day of
such three (3)-Business Day period, (C) (1) with respect to a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, that the Alternative
Transaction Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
adjustments to this Agreement and such other agreements were to be given
effect and (2) with respect to an Intervening Event, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal and
financial advisors, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
would continue to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law and (D) in the event of any change to (1) any of the financial
terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of a Superior Proposal, or (2) the facts or
circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in _clause (i)_ above and a new notice period under _clause (i)_
of this proviso shall commence (except that the three (3) Business Day notice
period referred to in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above shall instead be equal
to two (2) Business Days) during which time the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 8.4(f)_ anew with respect to
such additional notice, including _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ of this _Section
8.4(f)_.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.4_,
the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through their
respective Representatives, shall be permitted to (i) take or disclose any
position or disclose any information, in each case, reasonably required under
Applicable Law or in compliance with or otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
the Companys stockholders) and, to the extent referred to

 



      
 

 



 

therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, in
each case, with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii) make any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys stockholders) or take a neutral or no position
with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (iii) make any other
disclosure to the Companys stockholders that is reasonably required by
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosures permitted under
this _Section 8.4(g)_ shall not, in and of themselves, constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change or form a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1(c_) and (iv) waive any "standstill" or similar
provision in order to permit a Person to make an Alternative Transaction
Proposal to the extent permitted by _Section 8.4(b)(iv)_.

 



 

(h) No later than two (2) Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall notify Parent of the number of Exempted Persons and the
material terms and conditions of any Alternative Transaction Proposal received
from any Exempted Person (including any changes thereto), which Alternative
Transaction Proposal has not been withdrawn. From and after the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify Parent in
writing of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or bona fide inquiry (whether
written or oral) from any Person or group in respect of a potential
Alternative Transaction Proposal or if any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives in connection with
an Alternative Transaction Proposal and such notice shall include (x) the
identity of the Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
inquiry, request or offer, (y) the material terms and conditions of any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal or request and, if written, a copy thereof.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt
basis, of the status and material terms (including any changes to the material
terms and conditions thereof) of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal or
request in respect thereof and, if written, provide to Parent a copy thereof.

 



 

(i) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Subsidiary or
Representative of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 8.4_ will be deemed
to constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 8.4_.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents;_ _Filings_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall (i) take all steps reasonably
necessary, and proceed diligently and in good faith, and use reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable any necessary consents,
approvals, waivers, licenses, Permits, franchises, certificates,

reasonable best efforts to (A) avoid a claim, suit, petition to deny,
objection,

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding, investigation or other Legal Action, whether judicial or
administrative and whether brought by a Governmental Entity or other third
party, and (B) avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, stay, temporary restraining order or other Order in any such
claim, suit, petition to deny, objection, proceeding, investigation or other
Legal Action, in each case, challenging this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or that would otherwise prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Applicable Law, or any
regulatory and operational authorizations and arrangements necessary to own or
operate the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity (including the United States Department of
Justice, Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission) or other third
party, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining which material filings, submissions and declarations are required
to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which material consents,
approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, franchises, certificates,
registrations, variances, exemptions or authorizations, actions or non-
actions, are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time from,
Governmental Entities or other third parties in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

the Company, on the one hand, will provide Parent, and Parent, on the other

or the Companys counsel, with copies of any material correspondence, filing
or communication (or oral summaries or memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Prior to submitting or making any such material correspondence, filing
or communication to any such Governmental Entity or members of their
respective staffs, the parties shall first provide the other party or its
counsel with a copy of such correspondence, filing or communication in draft
form and give such other party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content
before it is submitted or filed with the relevant Governmental Entities, and
shall consider and take account of all reasonable comments timely made by the

Law and to the extent permitted by the Governmental Entity, each of the
parties shall ensure that the other party is given the opportunity to attend

Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee,
penalty or other consideration or incur any liability in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any contract other than _de
minimis_ amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed substantially
simultaneously by Parent.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) For purposes of this _Section 8.5_, "reasonable best efforts" shall
include (i) defending, contesting and objecting to any claims, suits,

(including the Surviving Corporation) with respect to, or its or their ability
to retain, one or more of its or their businesses, product lines or assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
not be required to take, and Parent and its Affiliates shall not take, any
such actions contemplated in _clauses (i)_ through _(_ _x_ _)_ above which

the Closing does not occur.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent agrees (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, "ultimate parent entities" (as the term is defined
under HSR Act pursuant to 16 C.F.R. § 801.1(a)(3)) (each, an " _Ultimate
Parent Entity_ ") and other Affiliates that are required by Applicable Law to

Days after the date hereof (or such other period as may be agreed in writing

consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, Permits, franchises, certificates,
registrations, variances, exemptions and authorizations of, and actions or
nonactions by, any Governmental Entity or other third party as promptly as
reasonably possible, but in any event before the Outside Date, or (B) effect
the expiration or termination of any waiting period, which would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date.

portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any Person or division thereof owning, operating or otherwise controlling any
assets or business, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
thereto or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to (A) delay (x) the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period or (y) the obtaining, or increasing the risk of not
obtaining, any consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, franchises,
certificates, registrations, variances, exemptions and authorizations of, or
actions or nonactions by, any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (C) otherwise prevent or materially impede,

contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Public Announcements; Public Disclosures_. Parent and the Company
will consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public statement
required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any applicable securities exchange, will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld); _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall be
permitted (without consulting with, or obtaining the consent of the other
party) to make such statements and announcements to its employees as the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall deem to be reasonably necessary that
(i) are consistent with, and contain no material information not included in,
previous public disclosures made in accordance with this _Section 8.6_, (ii)
with respect to communications by the Company, do not contain any material
non-public information of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates and
(iii) with respect to communications by Parent, do not contain any material
non-public information of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in this _Section 8.6_ shall limit
the Companys or the Company Boards rights under _Section 8.4_, (b) the
Company will no longer be required to consult with Parent in connection with
any such press release or public statement if the Company Board has made any
Adverse Recommendation Change or shall have resolved to do so and (c) the
requirements of this _Section 8.6_ shall not apply to any disclosure by the
Company or Parent of any information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the earlier of (x) December 31, 2019, and (y) the first (1st)
anniversary

 



      
 

 



 

of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
with respect to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who
is employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Employee_ "), (i) base salary and incentive compensation opportunities
(including annual bonus opportunities and including the value of equity and
equity-based incentives) which are no less favorable than the base salary and
incentive compensation opportunities provided by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to each such Company
Employee, (ii) pension and welfare benefits and perquisites which are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to each such Company
Employee and (iii) severance benefits as set forth in _Section 8.7(a)(iii)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from terminating the
employment of any Company Employee.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, benefit accrual, vacation and sick time credit
and eligibility to participate (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employee after the Effective Time (including the Company Benefit Plans) (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under
a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, any evidence of insurability
requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plan. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year. Any
vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Company Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Company
Employee following the Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual
limits or forfeiture that were not applicable as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) If the Closing occurs prior to the payment of 2018 bonuses, Parent shall
pay, or shall cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to pay the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Employees their bonuses for the 2018 calendar year in accordance with terms of
the annual incentive plans listed in _Section 5.17(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Annual Bonus Plans_ ") based upon performance for
the 2018 calendar year relative to the targets set under such plans. Such
annual bonuses shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.7(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur upon the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and assume in accordance with their
terms each Company Benefit Plan (including the severance benefits described in
Section 8.7(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and, in good faith,
interpret its provisions consistent with past practice and in any event, no
less favorably than the manner in which the Company Benefit Plan has been
interpreted in the past.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment to
any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of
their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment
of any Company Employee, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
and/or benefits that may be provided to any Company Employee by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any of their Affiliates or under any
benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of
their Affiliates may maintain.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Company Indemnification Provisions_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including in respect of any matters arising in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby),
existing as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in favor of any
current, former or future (i) director or officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) director, officer or trustee of another entity (but
only to the extent that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the
request of the Company) or (iii) employee or agent of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), in each
case, to the extent provided in the Constituent Documents of the Company or
the applicable Company Subsidiary shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Constituent
Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitation of liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
than those set forth in the Constituent Documents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. For a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, (A) Parent shall not, and shall not permit the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend,

 



      
 

 



 

repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving Corporations or any of its
Subsidiaries Constituent Documents relating to the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses of any Indemnified Party with
respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including in respect of any matters arising in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby), unless and only to the extent
required by Applicable Law, it being the intent of the parties that all such
Indemnified Parties shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law and that no change, modification or amendment of such documents
or arrangements may be made that will adversely affect any such Persons right
thereto without the prior written consent of that Person and (B) Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain
any indemnification agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with any Indemnified Party existing prior to the date of this Agreement and
set forth in Section 8.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, this _Section 8.8_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The Company shall obtain at its sole cost and expense, effective from and
after the Effective Time, a single payment, run-off policy or policies of
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance covering the
Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
and fiduciary liability insurance policies for claims arising in respect of
actual or alleged errors, misstatements, acts, omissions or any matter claimed
against any such Person occurring prior to the Effective Time in amount and
scope no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the Companys existing
policies, such policy or policies to become effective at the Effective Time
and remain in effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such run-off policy or
policies shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual
amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain its existing directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance policies. The Surviving
Corporation shall cause such policy or policies to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation. If the Company for any reason does not
obtain such run-off policy or policies as of the Effective Time, Parent shall
obtain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, such run-off policy or
policies from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier; provided, however, that, if such run-
off policy or policies cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be
required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium
equal to three hundred percent (300%) of such amount

 



 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 8.8(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.8(d)_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their respective representatives. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section 8.8_ shall survive
the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by an Indemnified Party in enforcing the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation provided in this _Section 8.8_.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to comply with this Agreement, perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, in each case, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or
incur or guarantee any indebtedness or liabilities.

 



 

Section 8.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on the Merger.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing no later
than the date the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Financing Commitments (including complying with any request exercising so-
called "market flex" provisions contained therein), including using reasonable
best efforts to (a) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments as
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (b) satisfy (or, if deemed
advisable by Parent, to obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
to obtaining the Financing (including by consummating the Equity Financing),
(c) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any "market
flex" provisions contained therein) or not less favorable to Parent or Merger
Sub with respect to conditionality than the terms and conditions contained in
the Debt Financing Commitments (including any "market flex" provisions
contained therein), so long as such terms shall not in any respect expand on
the conditions to funding of the Financing at the Closing or reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount required to satisfy the
Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing
and available cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the documentation relating to the bridge loan facility shall not be
required until reasonably necessary in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the funding of the Debt Financing, (d) enforce its rights
under the Debt Financing Commitments and (e) in the event that all conditions
in the Debt Financing Commitments (other than the availability or funding of
any Equity Financing) have been satisfied or waived, cause the lenders and
other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) To the extent requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail with respect to the status of the Financing and provide to the Company
copies of the definitive agreements for the Financing and shall give the
Company prompt written notice (i) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing of
which Parent or Merger Sub become aware, (ii) of the receipt of any notice or
other communication from any party to any Financing Commitment with respect to
any breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to
any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing
or any provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document
related to the Financing or any dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties thereto that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any part of the Financing
necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses on the terms and in the manner
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, and (iii) if Parent or Merger Sub
expects that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the
definitive documents related to the Financing.

 



 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to any amendment, supplement,
replacement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing without the prior written consent of the Company
other than amendments, modifications or waivers to the Debt Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements related to the Financing that would
not (and would not be reasonably expected to) (A) reduce the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing to an amount below the amount necessary to satisfy the
Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing
and available cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub or which would not reasonably be expected to have the result, effect or
consequence described in any of _clauses (A)_ , _(B) _or _(D)_ of this
sentence, to the receipt of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing, (C)
materially delay or prevent the Closing or (D) make the funding of the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining any of the Financing) less likely to occur or otherwise adversely
affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights under the
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing.
Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to any amendment, supplement,
replacement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Equity Financing Commitments in a manner that would
adversely affect the Companys rights thereunder. Parent shall furnish to the
Company a copy of any amendment,

 



      
 

 



 

supplement, replacement, modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the
Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable upon execution thereof, and
the term "Financing Commitments" shall mean the Financing Commitments as so
amended, supplemented, replaced or modified, including any Alternative
Financing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this _Section
8.11_ shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing
is available and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent on
Parents or Merger Subs ability to obtain the Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) or any specific term with respect to such financing.

 



 

(e) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) contemplated by
the Financing Commitments for any reason (A) Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient
to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the
Equity Financing and available cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, which Alternative Financing would not (x) involve
terms and conditions that are materially less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company, including with respect to conditionality, (y) involve any
conditions to funding the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments and (z) be reasonably expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or such Alternative
Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the purposes
of this _Section 8.11_, as applicable, any reference to "Debt Financing,"
"Financing" or "Debt Financing Commitments" shall include any Alternative
Financing required by this _Section 8.11_. Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company accurate and complete copies of the commitment letters pursuant to
which any source shall have committed to provide any portion of the
Alternative Financing (which, in the case of any fee letter, may be reduced in
a manner consistent with _Section 6.7_).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 8.11_ will require, and in no event will
the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Financing Commitments or (ii) pay any material
fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments

 



 

Section 8.12 _Financing_ _Assistance_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide, in each
case at Parents sole expense, such customary cooperation as may be reasonably
requested by Parent to assist them in causing the conditions in the Debt

practicable, inform Parent if the chief executive officer, chief financial

Financing Commitments or to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments, it being agreed that the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will not be required to provide any information or assistance

together with assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and expenses
relating to the incurrence of such debt or equity financing, (II) any post-
Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or

all outstanding amounts under any credit facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed that any prepayment is
(and shall be) contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing and no actions
shall be required which would obligate the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
to complete such prepayment prior to the occurrence of the Closing); (B)
arrange for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and releases and
instruments and acknowledgements of discharge in respect of any such credit

the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such
fiscal year and the related audited statements of income and cash flows;
_provided_ that the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations
under this _clause (x)_ upon filing the applicable financial statements with
the SEC;

 



 

(xi) provide Parent and the Debt Financing Sources at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date with all documentation and other information

Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their securities and the accuracy of
the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to
the Debt Financing.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.12(a)_, nothing
will require the Company to provide (or be deemed to require the Company to

adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in connection
with the Financing (including any synergies or cost savings), projections,
ownership or an as-adjusted capitalization table; (2) description of all or

the Securities Act ( _clauses (1)_ through _(4)_ , the " _Excluded
Information_ ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 8.12(a)_ to the contrary, (i) such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
business or the operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
nothing in this _Section 8.12_ or _Section 8.13_ shall require cooperation
to the extent that it would (A) subject any of the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries respective directors, managers, officers or

 



      
 

 



 

employees to any actual or potential personal liability (as opposed to
liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person) with respect to
matters related to the Debt Financing, (B) conflict with, or violate, the
Companys and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries organization documents or
any Applicable Law or Privacy Policies or result in a violation or breach of,
or default under, any Company Contract, (C) cause disclosure of any Personally
Identifiable Information in violation of Applicable Law, (D) cause or permit
any termination of or payment of principal or interest under (in each case
prior to the Effective Time) any contract referred to in _clause (a)(viii)_
above, (E) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ to
not be satisfied or (F) cause any breach of this Agreement, (iii) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to (A) pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur or assume any liability or other obligation in
connection with the financings contemplated by the Financing Commitments, the
definitive agreements related to the Financing or the Financing prior to the
Effective Time or be required to take any action that would subject it to
actual or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to make any
other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing Commitments, the definitive agreements related to the Financing, the
Financing or any information utilized in connection therewith, in each case,
that would not be reimbursed or indemnified by Parent or Merger Sub or (B)
deliver or obtain opinions of internal or external counsel, (iv) none of the
directors of the Company, acting in such capacity, shall be required to
execute, deliver or enter into or perform any agreement, document or
instrument, with respect to the Financing or adopt any resolutions or take any
other actions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to
which the Financing is obtained and (v) none of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or employees shall be
required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document
or instrument with respect to the Financing (other than customary
representation letters and authorization letters referred to above) that is
not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time and the directors and managers of the Company Subsidiaries
shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents
and instruments pursuant to which the Financing is obtained prior to the
Effective Time unless Parent and Merger Sub shall have determined that such
directors and managers are to remain as directors and managers of the Company
Subsidiaries on and after the Effective Time and such resolutions are
contingent upon the occurrence of, or only effective as of, the Effective
Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiarys logos
in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to
update any Required Financing Information provided to Parent and the Debt
Financing Sources as may be necessary so that such Required Financing
Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth
in the definition of "Required Financing Information" and (iii) would not,
after giving effect to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period to cease
pursuant to the definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the
cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section
8.12_ at any time, and from time to time on multiple occasions, between the
date hereof and the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to more than one
attempt

 



      
 

 



 

to access the markets. The Company agrees to (i) file all reports on Form 10-K
and Form 10-Q and, to the extent required to include financial information
pursuant to Item 9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and (ii) use reasonable best efforts
to file all other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the
time periods required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with
a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent
reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant
to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which information Parent
reasonably determines (and the Company does not unreasonably object) to
include in a customary offering memorandum or other marketing materials for
the Debt Financing, unless the Company reasonably objects, then the Company
shall file such Current Report on Form 8-K.

 



 

(d) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and Representatives from and against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the performance of their
respective obligations under this _Section 8.12_ and the provision of any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information provided in writing by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
specifically for use in connection therewith), in each case, other than to the
extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or Willful Breach of, this
Agreement by, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or, in each case, their
respective Representatives. Parent shall, promptly upon request of the
Company, reimburse the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all out-of-
pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (including those of its Affiliates and Representatives) in
connection with the cooperation required by this _Section 8.12_.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Treatment of Existing Notes_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to commence and conduct one or
more offers to purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer" (as such term
is defined in the applicable Indenture) and any tender offer, or any exchange
offer, and to conduct any consent solicitations (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), with respect to any or all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Companys senior unsecured notes
(the " _Notes_ ") identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on,
or after the date hereof on terms that are acceptable to Parent. Parent shall
not be permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer until Parent shall have
provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, letter of
transmittal or other related documents in connection with the Debt Offer
(collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time in
advance of Parent or Merger Sub commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow
the Company and its counsel to review and comment on the related Debt Offer
Documents. Parent will reasonably consult with the Company regarding the
timing and commencement of any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent
deadlines. The closing (or, in the case of consent solicitations,
operativeness) of the Debt Offers shall be expressly conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Debt Offers to close on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that the consummation

 



      
 

 



 

of a Debt Offer with respect to any series of Notes shall not be a condition
to Closing. The Debt Offers shall be conducted in compliance with any
applicable provisions of the applicable Indenture and with Applicable Law,
including SEC rules and regulations, and the Company shall not be required to
cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that is not in compliance with the
applicable Indenture and Applicable Law. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to
provide (or to cause to be provided) immediately available funds for the full
payment at the Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn
and any related consent payments to the extent required pursuant to the terms
of any applicable Debt Offer. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their
reasonable best efforts, at Parents sole expense as contemplated by _Section
8.13(d)_, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
Applicable Law conflict with this _Section 8.13_, Parent and the Company
shall comply with the Applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached
their obligations under this Agreement by such compliance.

 



 

(b) Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents, the Company shall
execute a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing each series of
Notes identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after
the date hereof (each, an " _Indenture_ ") in accordance with the applicable
Indenture, amending the terms and provisions of each such Indenture as
described in the Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by Parent, which
supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier than the Effective
Time, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under each
such Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Closing as determined by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or of its
Representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any
amendments or other agreement that would become operative prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable
best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the execution of the supplemental indentures. If reasonably
requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its legal counsel to provide all customary legal opinions required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this _Section 8.13_ to the
extent such legal opinion is required to be delivered prior to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or its
legal counsel be required to give an opinion as to compliance of a Debt Offer
with an Applicable Law or, if applicable, the provisions of the applicable
Indenture, if in the reasonable opinion of the Companys legal counsel, the
Debt Offer does not comply with such Applicable Law or the provisions of the
applicable Indenture, as the case may be, or to give an opinion with respect
to financing by the Parent.

 



 

(c) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of or in addition to Parent
commencing or closing a Debt Offer for any series of Notes, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted by such series of
Notes and the applicable Indenture, to (A) issue a notice of redemption for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes,
pursuant to the redemption provisions of the applicable Indenture, which
notice of redemption shall either be issued substantially simultaneously with
the Effective Time or be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing and (B) take any other actions prior to, at or after the Effective
Time reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to the

 



      
 

 



 

redemption and the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable
Indenture and the other provisions of such Indenture applicable thereto;

simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall have, or shall have
caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the applicable Indenture
sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. If
a conditional notice of redemption is given, Parent shall ensure that at the
Effective Time, so long as the applicable conditions of such redemption are
satisfied, the Company has all funds necessary in connection with any such
redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and
discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are
referred to collectively as the "Discharge" of such series of Notes. The
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts, at
Parents sole expense as contemplated by _Section 8.13(d)_, to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of
any series of Notes identified to the Company by Parent in writing at any
time.

Notes and (B) any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to the trustee or its
counsel pursuant to the applicable Indenture in connection with the Debt
Offers or Discharge in respect of any series of Notes. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any action taken by them in connection
with this _Section 8.13_ except to the extent suffered or incurred as a
result of the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material
breach of this _Section 8.13_ by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or the Companys Representatives.

 



 

Section 8.14 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and the Company
Subsidiaries operations.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, may adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC, so that the
disposition of any equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act (" _Section 16_") shall be an exempt transaction for

necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and the rules
and policies of NASDAQ to enable the Surviving Corporation to cause the
Companys securities to be de-listed from NASDAQ and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.

litigation arising from or related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought or threatened to be
brought against the Company or any members of the Company Board after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (" _Transaction Litigation_
"), the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Parent in
writing of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof, including by promptly informing
Parent of all proceedings and correspondence relating to such Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in,
but not control, the defense of any Transaction Litigation (and shall give due
consideration to Parents advice with respect to the Transaction Litigation)
and the Company shall not settle or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld).

 **ARTICLE X**

Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof (except as otherwise expressly noted):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is eight (8) months after the date
hereof (as such date may be extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent, the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , if all of the conditions to Closing, other
than the condition set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_, shall have been satisfied,
shall be capable of being satisfied at such time or would be capable of being
satisfied at such time but for the fact that the condition set forth in
_Section 9.1(a)_ is not satisfied, the Outside Date may be extended by either
the Company or Parent from time to time by written notice to the other party
up to a date not beyond the date that is ten (10) months after the date
hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to (i) the Company if it
is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section 9.3(b)_ or, (ii) Parent if it is
then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 9.2(a) or _Section 9.2(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the parties agree that neither party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ during the pendency of a
legal proceeding by the

 



      
 

 



 

other party for specific performance pursuant to _Section 11.11_; _provided_
, _further_ , in the event the Marketing Period has commenced but has not
completed as of the time of the Outside Date, the Outside Date may be extended

then remaining number of calendar days of the Marketing Period that have not
yet been completed) by Parent in its sole discretion by providing written
notice thereof to the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Outside Date until four (4) Business Days after the then-scheduled expiration
date of the Marketing Period;

 



 

(c) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

 



 

(d) by Parent or the Company, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;

 



 

(e) by Parent or the Company, if any Restraint shall be in effect permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the Merger
and such Restraint is or shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ shall have complied with its obligations
under _Section 8.5_ to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any such Restraint; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(e)_ shall not be available to a party
if the issuance of such final and non-appealable Restraint was primarily
attributable to the failure of such party, and in the case of Parent,
including the failure of Merger Sub, to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement;

 



 

(f) by the Company, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent or Merger Sub has
failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply
(i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.1_
or _Section 9.2_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured or, if curable, is not
cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, on or before the earlier of
(A) the Outside Date and (B) the date that is thirty (30) days following the
receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company of such breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply; _provided_ , that the Company is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(g) by Parent, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement on
the part of the Company or the Company has failed to perform or comply with
any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply (i) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.3_ and (ii) is
incapable of being cured or, if curable, is not cured by the Company on or
before the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) the date that is thirty
(30) days following the receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent
of such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply; _provided_ , that
Parent or Merger Sub is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(h) by the Company if, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal that did not
result from a breach of _Section 8.4_, (ii) to the extent permitted by and
effected in accordance with _Section 8.4(f)_, the Company Board approves, and
the Company concurrently with the termination of this Agreement enters into,
an Alternative Transaction Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
and (iii) the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant to the
terms of _Section 10.3_ concurrently with or prior to such termination; or

 



 

(i) by the Company, (i) if all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_
and _Section 9.3_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which to be
satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Merger by the time the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and the Company shall have delivered a written notice to Parent
and Merger Sub at least three (3) Business Days prior to such termination that
the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and have no effect, and the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement shall terminate, except for the provisions of _Section 5.27_,
_Section 6.13_, _Section 6.14_, the penultimate sentence of _Section 8.1_,
_Section 8.12(d)_, _Section 8.13(d)_, this _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_,
_ARTICLE I_ and _ARTICLE XI_, and, subject to _Section 10.3_, there shall
be no liability on the part of any party hereto or any Company Related Party
or Parent Related Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to this
_Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3(d)_ and _Section 11.11_, nothing herein shall
relieve any party hereto from any Losses arising out of its Willful Breach of,
or Fraud in connection with, any provision of this Agreement prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that nothing in this _Section 10.2_ shall be deemed to affect their right to
specific performance in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions set forth in _Section 11.11_. In addition to the foregoing, no
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_,
(B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_ or (C) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_ at a time Parent could have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_; or

 



 

(ii) (A) prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal shall have been publicly made to the Company
or directly to its stockholders generally and not publicly withdrawn, (B) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
10.1(b)_ (other than in circumstances in which the Company could terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_

 



       
 

 



 

 _10.1(f)_ or _Section 10.1(i)_) or _Section 10.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant
to _Section 10.1(g)_ and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate any Alternative
Transaction Proposal (which need not be the Alternative Transaction Proposal
that had been made prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting);
_provided_ , that references to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition
of Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)";

 



 

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. Any fee due
under this _Section 10.3(a)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds
to an account provided in writing by Parent to the Company (x) in the case of
termination pursuant to _clause (i)_ above, (A) concurrently with or prior to
such termination if terminated by the Company or (B) within two (2) Business
Days of delivery of notice of termination by Parent if terminated by Parent or
(y) in the case of termination pursuant to _clause (ii)_ above, within two
(2) Business Days of the entry into a definitive agreement for the
transactions referred to in _clause (ii)(C)_ above.

 



 

(b) In the event this Agreement is (i) terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_ or _Section 10.1(i)_ or (ii) terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ (in circumstances in which the Company
could terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ or _Section
10.1(i)_), Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount
equal to the Parent Termination Fee not later than the second (2nd) Business
Day following such termination.

 



 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_,
the Company shall reimburse Parent for its and its Affiliates Expenses up to
$20,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to
an account provided in writing by Parent to the Company within two (2)
Business Days of delivery of notice of termination. In the event that the
Parent Expenses have been paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section
10.3(c)_, any subsequent payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 10.3(a)(ii)_ shall be net of the amount of such Parent Expenses
previously paid by the Company.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the
Company would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that each of the Company Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and the
Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly, in the event that the
Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when
due or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, and in
order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
commences a suit for such fee which results in a judgment against either
party, then the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party such prevailing
partys Expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such suit and, in addition, if the prevailing party is the
party seeking such fees, the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party
interest on the amount of the fee owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at
such time, as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , plus two percent (2%)
per annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date
actually received by such party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 11.11_, in any circumstance
in which this Agreement is terminated and the Company is paid the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_, the Parent Termination Fee
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates and any of their, and
their respective Affiliates, direct or indirect, former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents, controlling persons, Representatives or assignees
(collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub,
the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Financing or any of their
respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, Representatives or assignees (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") for all Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and upon
payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing
Commitments or the transactions contemplated thereby (except in the case of
intentional or knowing fraud, it being understood that breach of any covenant
or agreement contained this Agreement, including any Willful Breach, shall
not, in and of itself, constitute Fraud (" _Fraud_ ") by Parent or Merger
Sub), and except that Parent shall also be obligated to the Company under the
third sentence of this _Section 10.3(d)_, _Section 8.12(d)_ and _Section
8.13(d)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, but subject to _Section 11.11_, in circumstances in which this
Agreement is terminated and Parent or any Affiliate or designee thereof, is
paid the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ or the Parent
Expenses pursuant to _Section 10.3(c)_, the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Expenses, as applicable, shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub and the other Parent Related Parties against the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Related Parties for all
Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except in the case of
Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud by the Company and except that the
Company shall also be obligated to Parent and Merger Sub under the third
sentence of this _Section 10.3(d)_); provided that the foregoing, including
the payment of the Parent Expenses, shall not relieve the Company of its
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
10.3(a)(ii)_ and _Section 10.3(c)_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company, any of its Affiliates, nor any
of its or their respective Representatives will have any rights or claims
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise), and will not seek any rights or
claims (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) against any of the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties in connection with this Agreement or the Debt
Financing and no Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto or for any
claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereby or by the Debt Financing or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this _Section 10.3(d)_ shall in any way limit or qualify
the rights and obligations of the Debt Financing Sources and the other parties
to the Debt Financing Commitments (or the definitive documents entered into
pursuant thereto) to each other thereunder or in connection therewith. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Debt Financing Source shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.

 



 

(e) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against the entities that
are expressly identified as parties hereto and no Parent Related Party or
Company Related Party shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights
of any party against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or
any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Parent Related Party or any Company Related Party, as the case may
be.

Section 11.3 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The specification of any
dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in _ARTICLE V_ or
_ARTICLE VI_ is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material for purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any
such amount in any dispute or controversy between or among the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Company
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on
the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits, Schedules and other documents and instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings (other than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
which is hereby incorporated by reference herein), both written and oral,
among the parties or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
including any transaction between or among the parties. This Agreement and all
of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise by any of the
parties without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (a) assign any or all of their
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent,
_provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder or (b) collaterally assign, without the Companys or any other
parties consent, any or all of the Parents or Merger Subs rights and
obligations hereunder to any Debt Financing Source in connection with the Debt
Financing, and any such Debt Financing Source may exercise all of the rights
and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder in connection with the
enforcement of any security or exercise of any remedies to the extent
permitted under the Debt Financing Commitments, _provided_ that no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations
hereunder. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this _Section 11.4_
shall be void. Except as set forth in this _Section 11.4_, no assignment by
any party hereto will relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in, and in all respects shall be
interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of, the
State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

 



 

(b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware_ _Courts_
") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), (ii) waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and (iii) agrees not to
plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
(A) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in

 



      
 

 



 

the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of
Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process and (B) service
of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to _clauses
(A)_ or _(B)_ of the immediately preceding sentence shall have the same
legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the
State of Delaware.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Company
Related Party and each of the other parties hereto acknowledges and
irrevocably agrees (i) that any legal proceeding, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Debt Financing
Source Related Party arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitments, or
the performance of services thereunder or related will be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each
party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
legal proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to
bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such legal proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at
their respective addresses provided in the Debt Financing Commitments will be
effective service of process against them for any such legal proceeding
brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection which any of them may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Action in any such court; and (v)
any litigation arising out of or related to the Debt Financing (including any
litigation involving any Debt Financing Source Related Party) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof

 



 

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING) IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH COMPANY
RELATED PARTY AND EACH OTHER PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE DEBT
FINANCING OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING
SOURCE RELATED PARTIES. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 11.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 8.5 _and _Section 10.2_), whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. As
used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
financial advisors, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its
Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the
solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties at any time
before or after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. Except as
required by Applicable Law, after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
there shall be no amendment that by Applicable Law requires further approval
by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein (or in any document delivered pursuant hereto) and (c) subject to the
requirements of Applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Except as required by Applicable Law, after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no waiver that by
Applicable Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without the further approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure
or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall act as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, _Section 10.2_ (Effects of Termination), Section
10.3(d) (Fees and Expenses), _Section 11.5_ (Governing Law and Venue; Waiver
of Jury Trial), _Section 11.7_ (Amendment), this _Section 11.8_ (Waiver) and
the last sentence of _Section 11.10_ (Parties in Interest), including, in
each case, the definitions of defined terms used therein (collectively, the "
_DFS Provisions_ "), may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in a
manner adverse to the Debt Financing Source Related Parties in any material
respect without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources that
are party to the Debt Financing Commitments, and no other amendment, waiver or
other modification to any other provision of this Agreement that has the
substantive effect of amending, waiving or modifying any of the DFS Provisions
in a manner adverse in any material respect to any Debt Financing Source
Related Party shall be effective without the prior written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources that are party to the Debt Financing Commitments.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall

 



      
 

 



 

constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party shall have received counterparts thereof signed and delivered
(by facsimile, e-mail of a .pdf attachment or otherwise) by all of the other
parties.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Severability; Validity; Parties in Interest_. If any provision
of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any rule of law or public policy,
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, and, to such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. Except (a) as
provided in _Section 8.8(a)_, which after the Effective Time, shall be for
the benefit of each Indemnified Party, and such Indemnified Partys heirs and
representatives, (b) following the Effective Time, for the provisions of
_ARTICLE IV_, which shall be for the benefit of any Person entitled to
payment thereunder and such Persons heirs and representatives and (c) for the
provisions of _Section 10.3(e)_, which shall be for the benefit of the
Company Related Parties and Parent Related Parties, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person not a party to this
Agreement any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing Source
Related Party shall be an express third-party beneficiary with respect to the
DFS Provisions.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Enforcement of Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached or the Merger is not consummated, and
that money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to this _Section 11.11_, the parties (on
behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
provided in _Section 11.10_) shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger and Parents obligation to pay, and the
right of the stockholders of the Company to receive, the Merger Consideration)
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided in this _Section
11.11_, each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such Order.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein, or in the Debt Financing
Commitments or the Equity Financing Commitments, to the contrary, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded and to consummate the Closing in accordance with _ARTICLE II_ if (a)
the conditions in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.3_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied at the Closing (and which are, at the time that the Company seeks
specific performance in accordance with this _Section 11.11_, capable of
being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time)), (b) the financing
provided for by the Debt Financing Commitment (or, the Alternative Financing,
as the case may be) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (c) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and (d)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if specific performance
is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, it will
take such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur in
accordance with _ARTICLE II_ (and the Company has not revoked, withdrawn,
modified or conditioned such irrevocable confirmation, and Parent and Sub fail
to complete the Closing within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the
Companys irrevocable written confirmation). In no event will the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger unless the
Debt Financing has been funded in full or will be funded in full at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing. Until such time as
Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee, the remedies available to the Company
pursuant to this _Section 11.11_ shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an
injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this
Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 10.3(b)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Commitments, the Equity Financing Commitments or otherwise, for the
avoidance of doubt, while either party may, subject in all respects to this
_Section 11.11_ and _Section 10.3(d)_, concurrently seek (i) specific
performance or other equitable relief and (ii) payment of (A) monetary damages
for Losses arising out of the Willful Breach of this Agreement or fraud of the
other party in connection with any provision of this Agreement as set forth in
_Section 10.2_ or (B) the Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee,
if, as and when required pursuant to _Section 10.3_, under no circumstances
shall either party, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to
receive (1) both (A) a grant of specific performance to cause the other party
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and (B) payment of any monetary damages whatsoever or payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as applicable or (2)
payment of any monetary damages whatsoever in addition to payment of the
Company Termination Fee, Parent Expenses or Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, other than monetary damages for Losses arising out of the Willful
Breach of the Company or Fraud.

 **EXHIBIT A**

 



 

 **Certificate** **of Incorporation**

 

 **of the Surviving Corporation**

 

(the " _Corporation_ ")

 



 

 _FIRST_ : The name of the Corporation is **[** * **]**.

 



 

 _SECOND_ : The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the
State of Delaware is **[** * **]**. The name of its registered agent at such
address is **[** * **]**.

 



 

 _THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended and
supplemented (the " _DGCL_ ").

 



 

 _FOURTH_ : The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall
have the authority to issue is **[** * **]** shares of common stock, par value
$ **[** * **]** per share (the " _Common Stock_ ").

 



 

 _FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the power conferred by
statute, the board of directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to
make, alter or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ")
subject to any limitations contained therein.

 



 

 _SIXTH_ : No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or
modification of this Article SIXTH by the stockholders of the Corporation
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect
to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

 



 

 _SEVENTH_ : Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (hereinafter, a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was a director, manager or officer of the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries (each, a " _Corporation Group Entity_ ") or while a
director, manager or officer of a Corporation Group Entity, is or was serving
at the request of such Corporation Group Entity as a director, officer,
manager, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter, a " _Covered Person_ ")
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent, or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
permitted by law (and, specifically in the case of the DGCL,

 



      
 

 



 

as such law is amended, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than previous to such
amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, excise taxes under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended from time to time, penalties and amounts to be paid in
settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such Covered
Person in connection therewith. Costs, charges and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or
officer to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately
be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Corporation as authorized in this Article SEVENTH. Such costs, charges
and expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the majority of a quorum of directors not
party to such proceeding, deems appropriate. The majority of the disinterested
directors may, and upon approval of such Covered Person, authorize the
Corporations counsel to represent such person, in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such action, suit or
proceeding. The rights conferred on any person by this Article SEVENTH shall
not be exclusive of any other rights which any Covered Person may have or
hereafter acquire under law, this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both
as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the
Corporation, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of such person. Any amendment,
repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH, or any amendment, repeal or
modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws
shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of such director,
officer, employee or agent or the obligations of the Corporation arising
hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any
actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, repeal or modification.

 



 

 _EIGHTH_ : The Corporation hereby acknowledges that certain Covered Persons
may have rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by a
stockholder of the Corporation or its affiliates (other than any Corporation
Group Entity) (directly or through insurance obtained by any such entity)
(collectively, the " _Stockholder Indemnitors_ "). The Corporation hereby
agrees and acknowledges that (i) it is the indemnitor of first resort with
respect to the Covered Persons, (ii) it shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by the Covered Persons, as required by law, the
terms of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, without regard to any
rights the Covered Persons may have against the Stockholder Indemnitors and
(iii) to the extent permitted by law, it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases the Stockholder Indemnitors from any and all claims against the
Stockholder Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that no
advancement or payment by the Stockholder Indemnitors on behalf of the
Corporation with respect to any claim for which the Covered Persons have
sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the
Stockholder Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be
subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Covered Persons against the Corporation. These rights shall
be a contract right.

 



      
 

 



 

 _NINTH_ : To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation
is authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which the DGCL permits the
Corporation to provide indemnification) through by-law provisions, agreements
with such agents or other persons, by vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement
otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, subject only to limits created
by the DGCL and applicable decisional law, with respect to actions for breach
of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders, and others.

 



 

 _TENTH_ : In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this
Certificate of Incorporation, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders;
provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall
invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

 



 

 _ELEVENTH_ : Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
by-laws of the Corporation shall so provide.

 



 

 _TWELFTH_ : To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in
being offered an opportunity to participate in, any and all business
opportunities that are presented to any of its stockholders or directors
(other than in their capacity as a director and other than those directors who
are employees of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries). Without limiting the foregoing renunciation, the Corporation
acknowledges that certain of the stockholders are in the business of making
investments in, and have investments in, other businesses similar to and that
may compete with the Corporations businesses (" _Competing Businesses_ "),
and agrees that each such stockholder shall have the right to make additional
investments in or have relationships with other Competing Businesses
independent of its investment in the Corporation. No stockholder that has
designated a director shall be obligated to present to the Corporation any
particular investment opportunity that such director or stockholder gains
access to, other than by reason of such directors status as a director (and
other than those directors who are employees of the Corporation), even if such
opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Corporation or one of
its subsidiaries, could be taken by the Corporation or such subsidiary, and
such director or stockholder shall continue to have the right to take for such
directors or stockholders own respective account or to recommend to others
any such particular investment opportunity. The provisions of this Article
TWELFTH shall in no way limit or eliminate any such stockholders or their
direct or indirect equityholders duties, responsibilities and obligations
with respect to the protection of any proprietary information of the
Corporation and any of its subsidiaries, including any applicable duty not to
disclose or use such proprietary information improperly or to obtain therefrom
an improper personal benefit. No amendment or repeal of this Article TWELFTH
shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any
director of the Corporation for or with respect to opportunities of which such
director becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal.

 



 

 _THIRTEENTH_ : The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provisions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner

 



      
 

 



 

now or hereafter prescribed by the DGCL. All rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
