Company ("Merger Sub"), and Zhone Technologies, Inc., a Delaware

into Zhone (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL");



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Zhone have
determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their
respective business strategies and is in the best interest of
their respective stockholders, and the Company has approved this Agreement
and the Merger as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub;



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, the Company, Merger Sub and Zhone
intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code");



WHEREAS, the stockholders of Zhone set forth on Annex A hereto have executed
and delivered to the Company irrevocable proxy and voting agreements (the
"Zhone Voting Agreement"), in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto as an inducement
to the Company to enter into this Agreement;



WHEREAS, the stockholders of the Company set forth on Annex B hereto have
executed and delivered to Zhone irrevocable proxy and voting agreements (the
"Company Voting Agreement"), in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto as an
inducement to Zhone to enter into this Agreement; and



WHEREAS, immediately after the Effective Time, the Company shall be renamed
Zhone Technologies, Inc.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



Article I

The Merger



_Section 1.1_ _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL, Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be merged with and into
Zhone. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and Zhone shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company.



_Section 1.2_ _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place on the first business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions (excluding conditions that,    by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) set forth in
Article VI, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to
its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing being referred to herein as the
"Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Latham and Watkins
LLP, 135 Commonwealth Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. As soon as practicable on
or after the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or if another date
and time is specified in such filing, such specified date and time, being the
"Effective Time").



_Section 1.3_ _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Zhone and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of Zhone and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



_Section 1.4_ _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. At the Effective Time,
(i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read in form and substance substantially the same as _Exhibit C_
hereto and (ii) the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to
read in form and substance substantially the same as _Exhibit D_ hereto,
in each case until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
applicable Law.



_Section 1.5_ _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the persons designated on Annex C hereto, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
persons designated on Annex C hereto, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.



_Section 1.6_ _Directors; Officers; Change of Company Name_. The parties will
take all action necessary such that as of the Effective Time (x) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall consist of the nine (9) members set forth on
Annex D hereto, which annex shall also designate the class of director and the
committees to which each such member will initially belong, of whom seven (7)
directors have been designated by Zhone (it being understood that Zhone shall
have the right to change the persons as set forth on Annex D hereto only with
the written consent of the Company) and two (2) directors have been designated
by the Company (it being understood that the Company shall have the right to
change the persons as set forth on Annex D hereto only with the written
consent of Zhone) and (y) the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Zhone shall become the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company. The parties shall take such action as is necessary to
structure the Board of Directors of the Company to satisfy applicable stock
exchange and corporate governance requirements. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, the two (2) directors to be designated by
the Company shall, in all cases, be "independent directors" in accordance with
applicable stock exchange requirements. Immediately after the Effective Time,
the  



 

2  Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all action necessary to amend the
Company Certificate (as defined) such that the Company shall be renamed
Zhone Technologies, Inc. (the "Name Change"), such Name Change to be effected
pursuant to § 253(b) of the DGCL.



Article II

Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates



_Section 2.1_ _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub,
Zhone or the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) _Conversion Generally_.



 

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Zhone ("Zhone
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Zhone Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)), shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2(e), into the right
to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of
the Company ("Company Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio. All such
shares of Zhone Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter
represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares of
Company Common Stock into which such Zhone Common Stock was converted in the
Merger. Certificates previously representing shares of Zhone Common Stock
shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Company
Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2, without
interest. No fractional share of Company Common Stock shall be issued, and in
lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2(e) hereof.



(ii) Each share of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share, of Zhone
("Zhone Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Zhone Preferred Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)), shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2(e),
into the right to receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio. All such shares of Zhone Preferred Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing the
shares of Company Common Stock into which such Zhone Preferred Stock was
converted in the Merger. Certificates previously representing shares of Zhone
Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares
of Company Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2, without
interest. No fractional share of Company Common Stock shall be issued, and in
lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2(e) hereof.



(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Zhone Common Stock or
Zhone Preferred Stock held by the Company, Merger Sub, any wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company or Merger Sub, in the treasury of Zhone or by
any wholly-owned  



 

3  subsidiary of Zhone immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.



(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



(d) _Change in Shares_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Exchange
Ratio assumes that no Reverse Stock Split has occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Zhone Common Stock, Zhone Preferred Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been changed (including as a result of the Reverse
Stock Split) into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

 



_Section 2.2_ _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall irrevocably
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare Trust Company or
another bank or trust company mutually agreed by the Company and Zhone (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Zhone Common
Stock (including Zhone Common Stock issued upon conversion of Zhone Preferred
Stock as contemplated by Section 6.2(e) hereof), for exchange in accordance
with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing
the shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash
in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such certificates for shares of Company Common
Stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") in exchange for outstanding shares of Zhone Common Stock
(including Zhone Common Stock issued upon conversion of Zhone Preferred Stock
as contemplated by Section 6.2(e) hereof). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Company Common Stock contemplated to
be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 and the cash contemplated to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Company
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock
(the "Certificates") (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in reasonable and customary form) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be  



 

4  reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Company Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Zhone
Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
(after taking into account all shares of Zhone Common Stock and Zhone
Preferred Stock then held by such holder), cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu
of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Zhone, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Company Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
reasonably satisfactory that any applicable stock transfer taxes, if any, have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing
shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), unless and until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (A) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to
a fractional share of Company Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Company Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring
after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Company Common
Stock.



(d) _Further Rights in Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock_. All
shares of Company Common Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of Zhone
Common Stock and Zhone Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e)) shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares of Zhone Common Stock and Zhone Preferred Stock.



 

5 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Company
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any
rights of a stockholder of the Company. In lieu of any fractional shares of
Company Common Stock that would otherwise be issued, each stockholder that
would have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Company
Common Stock shall, upon proper surrender of the Certificates, receive a cash
payment equal to such fraction multiplied by the average closing price of one
share of Company Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market (or
the NASDAQ National Market if the shares are so listed) for the five trading
days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the Effective
Time.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred
Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Company upon demand, and any holders of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to the Company for the shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Company Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



(g) _No Liability_. None of Zhone, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Zhone Common Stock or
Zhone Preferred Stock for any such shares of Company Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by the Company, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as the Company may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



(i) _Withholding_. The Company or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock such
amounts as the Company or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock
 



 

6  in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Company or
the Exchange Agent.



_Section 2.3_ _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Zhone Common Stock and Zhone Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder
who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the
DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code, shall
not be converted into a right to receive shares of Company Common Stock, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), unless such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses such stockholders right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such
stockholders right to appraisal, such shares of Zhone Common Stock or Zhone
Preferred Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive such consideration. Zhone shall give
the Company prompt notice of any demands received by Zhone for appraisal of
shares of Zhone Common Stock and Zhone Preferred Stock. Zhone shall not
settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with
respect to dissenting shares without the consent of the Company.



_Section 2.4_ _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all unexercised and
unexpired options to purchase Zhone Common Stock ("Zhone Options") then
outstanding, under any stock option plan of Zhone or any other plan, agreement
or arrangement (the "Zhone Stock Option Plans"), whether or not then
exercisable, will be assumed by the Company. Each Zhone Option so assumed by
the Company under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as set forth in the Zhone Stock Option Plan and
any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (i) each Zhone Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Company Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Zhone Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Zhone Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Zhone Option assumed, will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Zhone Common Stock at which such
Zhone Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent. The conversion of any Zhone
Options which are incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code, into options to purchase Company Common Stock shall be made so as
not to constitute a "modification" of such Zhone Options within the meaning of
Section 424 of the Code. A Zhone Employees continuous employment with Zhone
or its Subsidiaries shall be credited to the optionee for purposes of
determining the vesting of all assumed Zhone Options after the Effective Time.



_Section 2.5_ _Warrants_



(a) At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of Zhone Common
Stock (a "Zhone Warrant") which is outstanding immediately prior thereto
shall, in  



 

7  accordance with the terms thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire
shares of Zhone Common Stock and automatically shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a
warrant to purchase Company Common Stock (as so converted, a "Zhone Converted
Warrant"). Each Zhone Converted Warrant shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in any agreements thereunder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective
Time, (i) each Zhone Converted Warrant shall be exercisable (or shall become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Company Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Zhone Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Zhone Converted Warrant shall be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Zhone Common Stock at which such
Zhone Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent.



(b) At the Effective Time, if still outstanding, the warrants to
purchase shares of Zhone Preferred Stock held by Silicon Valley Bank and
Woodruff-Sawyer and Co. and any other warrant to purchase shares of Zhone
Preferred Stock (each, a "Zhone Preferred Warrant") shall, in accordance with
the terms thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Zhone
Preferred Stock and automatically shall be converted, at the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a warrant to
purchase Company Common Stock (as so converted, a "Zhone Preferred Converted
Warrant"). Each Zhone Preferred Converted Warrant shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the agreement
thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the
Effective Time, (i) each Zhone Preferred Converted Warrant shall be
exercisable (or shall become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole shares of Company Common Stock equal to the product
of the number of shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Zhone
Preferred Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Company
Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Zhone Preferred Converted Warrant
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Zhone Preferred Stock at which such Zhone Preferred Warrant was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest whole cent.



_Section 2.6_ _Restricted Stock_. If any shares of Zhone Common Stock, Zhone
Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition providing that such shares may
be forfeited or repurchased upon any termination of the stockholders
employment, directorship or other relationship with Zhone or the Company, as
the case may be (and/or any Subsidiary of Zhone or the Company), under the
terms of any agreement with Zhone or the Company (and/or any Subsidiary of
Zhone or the Company), as applicable, that does not by its terms provide that
such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses upon
consummation of the Merger, then (i) with respect to such shares of Zhone
Common Stock or Zhone Preferred Stock, the shares of Company Common Stock
issued upon the conversion of such shares in the Merger will continue to be
unvested and subject to the  



 

8  same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions following
the Effective Time, and the certificates representing such shares of
Company Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends
noting such repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions and
(ii) with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, such shares will
continue to be unvested and subject to the same repurchase options, risks of
forfeiture or other conditions following the Effective Time.



Article III

Representations and Warranties of the Company and Merger Sub 



Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule which identifies exceptions by
specific section references ( _provided_ , that any matter disclosed in any
section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be considered disclosed for other
sections of the Disclosure Schedule, but only to the extent such matter on
its face would be reasonably expected to be pertinent to a particular section
of the Disclosure Schedule in light of the disclosure made in such section)
delivered by the Company to Zhone prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company and Merger Sub hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant to Zhone as follows:



_Section 3.1_ _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1
of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
holds an Equity Interest in any other person.



_Section 3.2_ _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Corporate Books and
Records_. The copies of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and Amended and Restated By-laws
(the "Company By-laws") that are listed as exhibits to the Companys Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (the "Company Form 10-K") are
complete and correct copies thereof as in effect on the date hereof. The
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Certificate or the Company By-laws. True and complete copies of all
minute books of the Company have been made available by the Company to Zhone.



 

9 _Section 3.3_ _Capitalization_



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 900,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$.001 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of July 23, 2003, (A)
111,871,592 shares of Company Common Stock (other than treasury shares) were
issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (B) 7,408,295 shares of Company
Common Stock were held in the treasury of the Company or by its Subsidiaries,
and (C) 20,364,139 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable (and such

Common Stock ("Company Options") outstanding on such date. As of the date
hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding.
All capital stock or other equity securities of the Company have been issued
in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws.



(b) Except for Company Options to purchase not more than 20,364,139 shares of
Company Common Stock and arrangements and agreements set forth in Section 3.3
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of July 23, 2003, there were no
options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other
Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2003, the Company has not issued any shares of
its capital stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock or other Equity Interests, other than those shares of capital
stock reserved for issuance as set forth in this Section 3.3 or Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has provided Zhone with a true
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which outstanding
Company Options may be exercised under the applicable stock option plan of
the Company or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the "Company Stock
Plans"), the number of Company Options outstanding at each such price and the
vesting schedule of the Company Options. All shares of Company Common Stock
subject to issuance under the Company Stock Option Plans, upon issuance on the
terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights.



(c) Except for the Company Voting Agreement and as set forth in Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A) restricting the
transfer of, (B) affecting the voting rights of, (C) requiring the repurchase,
redemption or disposition of, or containing any right of first refusal with
respect to, (D) requiring the registration for sale of, or (E) granting
any preemptive or antidilutive right with respect to, any shares of Company
Common Stock or any capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, each outstanding share of capital stock of each
Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of
record, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims,  



 

10  pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on the
Companys or such other of its Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise)
in, any of its Subsidiaries or any other person, other than guarantees by the
Company of any indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly-owned
Subsidiary.



(d) The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes, or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter. The Company has not adopted a
stockholder rights plan.



(e) None of the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby will result
in an acceleration of vesting, or modification of vesting terms, with respect
to any Company Options, except for those Company Options set forth in Section
3.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and as provided in the Severance
Plan.



_Section 3.4_ _Authority_.



(a) Each of the Company and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and Merger Sub and
the consummation by the Company and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
or Merger Sub and no stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than as
provided in Section 3.20. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly
executed and delivered by each of the Company and Merger Sub and constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the Company and Merger Sub,

terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles.



(b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), by
resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held
and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "Company Board
Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger), and (iii) resolved to recommend (subject to Section 5.4(a)) that
the stockholders of the Company vote for approval of the issuance of Company
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger as required by NASD Rule
4350(i)(B). The Company Board Approval constitutes approval of this Agreement
and the Merger as required under any applicable state takeover Law and no
such state takeover Law is applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the restrictions on
business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL. 



 

11 (c) Merger Subs Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the Company
and Merger Sub does not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of the
Company and Merger Sub will not, (A) (assuming the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained) conflict with or violate any provision of the Company
Certificate or Company By-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of
any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), (B) (assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in Section 3.5(b)
have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in Section
3.5(b) have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or
expired) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (C) require any consent or approval
under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, constitute a
change of control or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contract, Company Permit
or other instrument or obligation, except, with respect to clauses (B) and
(C), for any such conflicts, violations, consents, approvals, breaches,
losses, defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the Company and
Merger Sub does not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of the
Company and Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization
or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or
any other person, except (A) under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act,
applicable Blue Sky Law, the HSR Act, the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ
SmallCap Market and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger
as required by the DGCL and (B) where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.6 _ _Permits; Compliance With Law_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, approvals and clearances of any Governmental Entity necessary
for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its respective businesses substantially in the
manner described in the Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof and
substantially as it is being conducted as of the date hereof (the "Company
Permits"), and all such Company Permits are valid, and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the Company
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. None of the  



 

12  Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or
violation of, (x) any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is bound or affected or (y) any Company Permits, except in each case for any
such conflicts, defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.7_ _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) The Company has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses,
forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, since January 1, 2000 (collectively, the "Company SEC Filings"). Each
Company SEC Filing (A) as of the time it was filed, complied or, if filed
subsequent to the date hereof, will comply, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (B) did not, at the time it was filed, or, if filed subsequent to the date
hereof, will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were or will be made, not misleading.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings was, or will
be, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a consistent
basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto), and each presented, or will present, fairly the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
the consolidated Subsidiaries of the Company as of the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments which did not and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect).
The books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been,
and are being, maintained in accordance with applicable material legal and
accounting requirements.



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 included
in the Company Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, including the
notes thereto, none of the Company or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on a balance
sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for normal
year-end adjustments and liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business since March 31, 2003 that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



(d) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that the Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC since July 31,
2002, was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or furnished
by the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant
to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
under such act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the  



 

13  "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification (i) was true and accurate and complied with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) did not contain any qualifications or exceptions
to the matters certified therein, except as otherwise permitted under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (iii) has not been modified or withdrawn. Neither
the Company nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental
Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, content, form or
manner of filing or furnishing of such certifications. The Companys
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-14(c) and
15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable the Company to comply with,
and the appropriate officers of the Company to make all certifications
required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 



(e) Section 3.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all accounts
receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries in an amount in excess of
$500,000 as of the date hereof. Such receivables represent bona fide claims of
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries for services performed or other charges or
valid consideration arising prior to the date hereof and require no
additional performance by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such receivables
are not subject to any defense, set-off or counterclaim and are fully
collectible in the ordinary course of business.



_Section 3.8_ _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
the Company Financial Advisor) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
heretofore made available to Zhone a true and complete copy of a letter
agreement between the Company and the Company Financial Advisor regarding any
payments pursuant to which such firm would be entitled as a result of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any future
transactions undertaken by the Company.



_Section 3.9_ _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since March 31, 2003,
except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this Agreement or
Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has conducted its businesses in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and, since such date, there has not been (A) any Material
Adverse Effect or an event or development that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or (B) any action taken by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from March 31, 2003
through the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach
of Section 5.1.



_Section 3.10_ _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA and any other plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding
or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other
benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant
(or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate), which are now, or were within the past 6 years, maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or under

contingent, including, without limitation, all incentive, bonus, deferred
compensation, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock
purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock or
other stock-based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices or
arrangements (each a "Company Benefit Plan"). Neither the Company, nor to the
knowledge of the Company, or any other person or entity, has any express or
implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to establish, modify,
change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code. With
respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to Zhone true,
correct and complete copies of (A) each Company Benefit Plan (or, if not
written a written summary of its material terms), including without limitation
all plan documents, adoption agreements, trust agreements, insurance contracts
or other funding vehicles and all amendments thereto, (B) all summaries and
summary plan descriptions, including any summary of material modifications,
(C) the annual reports (Form 5500 series) for the three most recent years
filed or required to be filed with the IRS with respect to such Company
Benefit Plan (and, if any such annual report is a Form 5500R, the Form 5500C
filed with respect to such Company Benefit Plan), (D) the most recent
actuarial report or other financial statement relating to such Company Benefit
Plan, (E) the most recent determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by
the IRS with respect to any Company Benefit Plan and any pending request for
such a determination letter, (F) the most recent nondiscrimination tests

Benefit Plan, and (G) all filings made with any Governmental Entity, including
but not limited any filings under the Voluntary Compliance Resolution or
Closing Agreement Program or the Department of Labor Delinquent Filer
Program. 



(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely

reasonably be expected to, facilitate an Acquisition Proposal or the making,
submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person
any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to

in discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify such person as to the existence of these provisions,
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
it, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
agreement, commitment or understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to
any Acquisition Proposal or a transaction contemplated thereby; provided,

Stockholders Meeting contemplated by Section 5.4(a) the Company may, or in
the case of Zhone, prior to obtaining the approval of Zhones stockholders at
the Zhone Stockholders Meeting contemplated by Section 5.4(b), Zhone may, in
response to a written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited after the
date hereof and otherwise in compliance with the obligations under Section
5.6(c), participate in discussions or negotiations with, request
clarifications from, or furnish information to, any person which makes such
Acquisition Proposal if (x) such action is taken subject to a confidentiality
agreement containing customary terms and conditions; provided, that if such
confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive than
the comparable provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, or omits
restrictive provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, then the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended to
contain in substitution for such comparable provisions such less restrictive
provisions, or to omit such restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and in
connection with the foregoing, such party agrees not to waive any of the
provisions in any such confidentiality agreement without waiving the
similar provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent, (y)
the Company Board or Zhone Board, as applicable, reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with nationally recognized outside legal counsel
(which may be its current outside legal counsel) and financial advisor (which
may be its current outside financial advisor), that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and (z) the Company Board or Zhone Board, as
applicable, reasonably determines in good faith, after  



 

42  consultation with nationally recognized outside legal counsel (which may be
its current outside legal counsel), that failure to take such actions
would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6(a) by any Representative of a party
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act
on behalf of a party, shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.6(a). Each
of the Company and Zhone shall immediately terminate, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to immediately
terminate, all discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party with
respect to, or any that could reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplate
the possibility of, an Acquisition Proposal.



(b) Neither Company Board or Zhone Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw, modify or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in a
manner adverse to the other party hereto, the Company Recommendation or the
Zhone Recommendation, as the case may be or (ii) resolve to do any of the
foregoing; provided, that the Company Board and Zhone Board may withdraw,
modify or amend the Company Recommendation or Zhone Recommendation, as
applicable, prior to obtaining the approval of its stockholders as
contemplated by Section 5.4 if, following receipt of a Superior Proposal (x)
such party has complied with its obligations under this Section 5.6, (y) the
Company Board or Zhone Board, as applicable, reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with nationally recognized outside legal counsel
(which may be its current outside legal counsel), that failure to take such
actions would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(z) prior to taking such actions, the Company Board shall have given Zhone,
and the Zhone Board shall have given the Company, at least five business days
notice of its intention to take such action and the opportunity during such
period to submit a competing proposal (which shall be considered by the
Company Board or Zhone Board, as applicable, in good faith, after
consultation with nationally recognized outside legal counsel (which may be
its current outside legal counsel) and financial advisor (which may be its
current outside financial advisor)) so that the Superior Proposal no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.



(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 5.6(a), the Company
or Zhone, as applicable, shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 24 hours) advise the other of any request for information with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal, discussions or negotiation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
the terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, discussion or negotiation and the Company or Zhone, as applicable,
shall, within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, promptly provide to the other
copies of any written materials received in connection with any of the
foregoing. The Company or Zhone, as applicable, shall keep the other
fully informed of the status and material details (including amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such request or Acquisition Proposal and keep the
other fully informed as to the material details of any information requested
of or provided to it and as to the details of all discussions or negotiations
with respect to any such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or proposal,
and shall provide to the other within 24 hours of receipt thereof all written
materials received by it with respect thereto. The Company or Zhone, as
applicable, shall promptly provide to the other any non-public information
concerning it provided to any other person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, which was not previously provided to the other party.



 

43 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
parties from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act.

efforts to (A) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (B) obtain from any
Governmental Entity any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or
Zhone or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in
connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, including, without limitation, the Merger, and (C) make
all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (x) the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state
securities Laws, (y) the HSR Act, and (z) any other applicable Law; provided,
that the Company and Zhone shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including, if requested, by providing copies
of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing
and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 5.7(a) shall require the expenditure of money by Zhone or the Company
to a third party in exchange for any such consent (other than nominal filing
or processing fees). The Company and Zhone shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law (including all information required to be included in the Proxy Statement
and the Registration Statement) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) The Company and Zhone shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, all commercially reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents, (A) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (B) required
to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Zhone Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, or (C) required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company or Zhone from occurring prior to or after the
Effective Time. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third
party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 5.7(b), such
party shall use all commercially reasonable best efforts, and shall take any
such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Zhone, their respective Subsidiaries, and
their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected
to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.



_Section 5.8_ _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto of (A) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would
be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this  



 

44  Agreement not to be satisfied, or (B) the failure of the Company or Zhone,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided, however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



_Section 5.9_ _Public Announcements_. The press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement, if any, shall be issued only in such form as
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Zhone and each of the
Company and Zhone shall consult with, and obtain the consent of, the other
party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before issuing any
other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to consulting with and obtaining the
prior consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); _provided_ , that a party may, without consulting with or obtaining
the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such
public statement as may be required by applicable Law or, in the case of the
Company, by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or
automated quotation system to which it is a party, if such party has used
commercially reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to
obtain such other partys consent, but has been unable to do so in a timely
manner.



_Section 5.10_ _NASDAQ SmallCap Market Listing_. The Company shall promptly
prepare and submit to the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and any other applicable
exchange a listing application covering the shares of Company Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger and shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause such shares to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ SmallCap
Market, including, without limitation, effecting a reverse stock split if
necessary with respect to the then-outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, such that each share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
such lesser number of shares of Company Common Stock according to a ratio
between (and including) 10 into 1 and 4 into 1 to be agreed by the parties
(the "Reverse Stock Split"), subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in connection with the Merger,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts, including,
without limitation, by effecting the Reverse Stock Split if necessary, to
transfer the Company Common Stock for listing on the NASDAQ National Market
(including, without limitation, through seeking eligibility through the
continued listing requirements or by seeking a "phase-up" review by NASDAQ).
Zhone shall furnish such information concerning it and the holders of its
capital stock as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the listing application.



_Section 5.11_ _Employee Benefit and Section 16 Matters_



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt a severance plan, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Zhone (the "Severance Plan"),
covering:



 

45 (i) each of the individuals listed on Annex E hereto (collectively, the
"Executives") which will provide that if an Executives employment is
terminated without cause by the Company or by the Executive due to a
substantial reduction in salary or substantial diminishment of job
responsibilities during the one year period following the Closing, he/she
shall be entitled to only the following benefits as severance in exchange for
executing a release of claims against the Company: (i) a lump sum severance
payment equal to one years base salary; (ii) a prorated portion of any bonus
payable for the year in which the termination occurs, provided that such
amount shall not be less than the prorated portion of the greater of (A) the
bonus earned by the Executive in the immediately prior year and (B) the target
bonus payable for the year in which the termination occurs calculated on the
basis that the Executive achieved all requisite objectives; (iii) continuation
of health care benefits for one year under the Companys health benefit plans
as in effect from time to time at the same cost as an active employee of the
Company, with such continuation being coincident with and not in addition to
any coverage continuation required by applicable Law; (iv) the ability to
continue vesting in any unvested Company stock options outstanding on the
date hereof for a period of one year following termination; and (v) the
ability to exercise any options once vested for a period of two years
following termination;



(ii) each of the individuals listed on Annex F hereto (collectively,
the "Senior Managers") which will provide that if a Senior Mangers
employment is terminated without cause by the Company or by the Senior Manager
due to a substantial reduction in salary or substantial diminishment in
job responsibilities during the one year period following the Closing, he/she
shall be entitled to only the following benefits as severance in exchange for
executing a release of claims against the Company: (i) a lump sum severance
payment equal to six months base salary; (ii) continuation of health care
benefits for six months under the Companys health benefit plans as in effect
from time to time at the same cost as an active employee of the Company, with
such continuation being coincident with and not in addition to any coverage
continuation required by applicable Law; (iii) the ability to continue vesting
in any unvested Company stock options outstanding on the date hereof for a
period of six months following termination; and (iv) the ability to exercise
any options once vested for a period of two years following such termination;
and



(iii) each of the individuals listed on Annex G hereto (collectively, the
"Management Employees") which will provide that if a Management Employees
employment is terminated without cause by the Company or by the Management
Employee due to a substantial reduction in salary or a substantial
diminishment in job responsibilities during the one year period following the
Closing, he/she shall be entitled to only the following benefits as severance
in exchange for executing a release of claims against the Company: (i) a lump
sum severance payment equal to six months base salary; (ii) continuation of
health care benefits for six months under the Companys health benefit plans
as in effect from time to time at the same cost as an active employee of the
Company, with such continuation being coincident with and not in addition to
any coverage continuation required by applicable Law; and (iii) the ability
to exercise any Company stock options that are vested on the date of
termination for a period of two years following such termination.



(b) All employees of the Company (other than the Executives, the Senior
Managers and the Management Employees) shall only be entitled to severance to
the



 

46  extent required by applicable Law, or as pay in lieu of notice in the event
that the provisions of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
of 1988 or any other similar state or local Law apply; provided, however, if
such employee is terminated without cause by the Company during the one year
period following the Closing, the Company may offer, in exchange for obtaining
a release by such employee of all claims against the Company, to extend the
exercise period of such employees Company stock options that are vested on
the date of termination for a period of two years following such termination.



(c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan in which employees of Zhone and
its Subsidiaries ("Zhone Employees") participate after the Effective Time, for
purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for
severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service with Zhone (or
predecessor employers to the extent Zhone provides past service credit) shall
be treated as service with the Company; provided, that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized
under the applicable Zhone Benefit Plan. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations.
Each Company Benefit Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to
the same extent waived under the applicable Zhone Benefit Plan. Zhone
Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding
benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Benefit Plan for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.



(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and Zhone Board, or
appropriate committees of non-employee directors, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition
by any officer or director of Zhone who may become a covered person of the
Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder ("Section 16") of shares of Company Common Stock or
options or warrants to acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16.



(e) Following the Closing, the Company shall provide similarly situated
employees of the Company who were employees of the Company as of the Effective
Time and employees of the Company who were employees of Zhone prior to the
Effective Time with substantially similar compensation and benefits in the
aggregate.



(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.11 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any
other person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees,
any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or Zhone Benefit Plan or any
beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with the Company or
Zhone. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall
interfere with the Companys right to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or Zhone Benefit Plan or to terminate the employment of any
employee of the Company or Zhone for any reason.



 

47 _Section 5.12_ _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.



(a) Zhone and the Company agree that the indemnification obligations
set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company By-laws shall survive
the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who on or prior to
the Effective Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who served at the request
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee,
partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,
unless such amendment or modification is required by applicable Law. 



(b) For six years from the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to the
Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the "DandO Insurance") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing
policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided to Zhone)
or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, which premium the
Company represents and warrants to be approximately $2,025,000. The provisions
of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied
if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of this Section 5.12, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.



(c) In the event the Company (A) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.



(d) The obligations under this Section 5.12 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.12 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.12 applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.12).



_Section 5.13_ _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_



(a) The Company and Zhone shall use their commercially reasonable
best efforts, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their
commercially reasonable best efforts, to take or cause to be taken any action
necessary for the Merger to



 

48  qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor Zhone shall, nor shall they permit any of
their respective Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken any action that
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto
hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of the Company
and Zhone shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.



(c) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
best efforts in order for Zhone to obtain the opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP
described in Section 6.3(e). In connection therewith, the Company (together
with Merger Sub) and Zhone shall deliver to Latham and Watkins LLP
representation letters, dated and executed as of the dates of such opinion, in
substantially the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit E_ and _Exhibit
F_ respectively.

(a) Zhone shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered to the Company two letters from Zhones independent accountants, one
dated a date within two business days before the date on which the
Registration Statement shall become effective and one dated a date within two
business days before the Closing Date, each addressed to the Company, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope
and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants
in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration
Statement.



(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause to
be delivered to Zhone two letters from the Companys independent accountants,
one dated a date within two business days before the date on which the
Registration Statement shall become effective and one dated a date within two
business days before the Closing Date, each addressed to Zhone, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Zhone and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.



_Section 5.15_ _Affiliates_. As soon as practicable after the date hereof,
Zhone shall deliver to the Company a list identifying all persons who are
expected to be, at the time of the Zhone Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates"
of Zhone for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Zhone shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is
identified on such list to execute and deliver to the Company a letter
agreement as to such persons prospective compliance with the restrictions
imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act on the transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock received by such person in the Merger.



_Section 5.16_ _Officer s Certificates_



(a) Not later than five business days prior to (x) the mailing date of the
Joint/Proxy Prospectus and (y) the anticipated Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to  



 

49  Zhone in writing its estimate (as of the Effective Time) of the number of

Company shall provide to Zhone a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer
of the Company setting forth the number of Company Fully Diluted Shares.

respective Boards of Directors;



(b) By either the Company or Zhone if the Merger shall not have been

(e) By the Company if it receives a Superior Proposal and its Board of

nationally recognized outside legal counsel (which may be its current outside
legal counsel) and financial advisor (which may be its current outside

consultation with nationally recognized outside legal counsel (which may be
its current outside legal counsel), that it is necessary to terminate
this Agreement and enter into an agreement to effect the Superior Proposal in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z) (A)

warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which (i) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) and
(ii) cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ that Zhone shall

by either Zhone or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on
the part of Zhone or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or
directors except (x) with respect to Section 5.5, Section 5.9, this Section
7.2 and Article VIII and (y) with respect to any liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the willful and material breach
by the other party of any representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement.



(b) _Zhone Expenses_. Zhone and the Company agree that if either party shall

54 (d) _Payment of Expenses_. Payment of Expenses pursuant to Section 7.2(b) or
Section 7.2(c) shall be made not later than two business days after delivery

delivers such notice of demand for payment).



(e) _Company Termination Fee_. The Company shall pay to Zhone a termination
fee (the "Company Termination Fee") of $3,000,000 as liquidated damages in
immediately available funds in the event that this Agreement is terminated
solely as follows: (i) if the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant

Section 7.1(d); (iii) if Zhone shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f); or (iv) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(h)(i) and, at any time after the
date of this Agreement and before the termination of this Agreement, an

result of a termination under Section 7.1(h)(i), the amount of any Zhone

of the Company Termination Fee due and owing (such that the maximum amount
payable by the Company in the event of a termination by either party pursuant
to Section 7.1(h)(i) hereof shall be $3,000,000). Any Company Termination Fee
payable under this provision shall be payable as liquidated damages to
compensate Zhone for the damages Zhone will suffer if this Agreement is
terminated in the circumstances set forth in this Section 7.2(e), which
damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. It is specifically
agreed that any Company Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to this Section
7.2(e) represents liquidated damages and not a penalty. 



(f) _Zhone Termination Fee_. Zhone shall pay to the Company a termination fee

proposed or communicated and not bona fide withdrawn and (B) within twelve
months following the termination of this Agreement, Zhone consummates any
Acquisition Proposal or enters into an agreement, understanding (including a
letter of intent) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal which is
subsequently consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the
Zhone Termination Fee is payable under clause (iii) above as a result of a
termination under Section 7.1(h)(ii), the amount of any Company Expense
Reimbursement that has been paid shall be subtracted from the amount of the
Zhone Termination Fee due and owing (such that the maximum amount payable by
Zhone in the event of a termination by either party pursuant to Section
7.1(h)(ii) hereof shall be $3,000,000). Any Zhone Termination Fee payable
under this provision shall be payable as  



 

55  liquidated damages to compensate the Company for the damages the Company
will suffer if this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances set forth in
this Section 7.2(f), which damages cannot be determined with reasonable
certainty. It is specifically agreed that any Zhone Termination Fee to be paid
pursuant to this Section 7.2(f) represents liquidated damages and not a
penalty.



(g) _All Payments_. The Company Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant
to Section 7.2(e)(i) shall be paid prior to, and shall be a pre-condition to
the effectiveness of, termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(e). Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(ii),
7.2(e)(iii), 7.2(f)(i) or 7.2(f)(ii) shall be made not later than two
business days after the date of termination. Any payment required to be made
pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(iv) or 7.2(f)(iii) shall be made not later than two
business days after the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal. In no event
shall more than one Company Termination Fee or Zhone Termination Fee be made.
In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
nor shall Zhone be required to pay the Zhone Termination Fee if, immediately
prior to the termination of this Agreement, the entity otherwise entitled to
receive such fee was in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement. All payments under Section 7.2 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the party entitled to
receive payment. The Company and Zhone acknowledge that the agreements
contained in Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor
Zhone would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails
promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company or Zhone, as applicable, commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the other party for the fee set forth in
this Section 7.2, such defaulting party shall pay to the prevailing party its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.



_Section 7.3_ _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
Zhone and the Company; _provided_ , that after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval by the Companys
or Zhones stockholders, as the case may be, without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties.



_Section 7.4_ _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein;
_provided, however_ , that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of either party, there may
not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver
of this Agreement or any portion thereof which, by Law or, in the case of the
Company, in accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ SmallCap Market, requires
further approval by such stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument 



 

56  in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.



_Section 7.5_ _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 7.2(a), Section 7.2(b)
and Section 7.2(c) hereof, all expenses incurred by the parties hereto shall
be borne solely and entirely by the party which has incurred the same
(including, but not limited to, fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers and other advisors); _provided, however_ , that each of
Zhone and the Company shall pay one-half of the expenses related to (i)
printing, filing and mailing the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy/Prospectus and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in
connection with the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and
(ii) the preparation and delivery of any tax opinion required to be filed with
the Proxy Statement, Registration Statement or Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the
tax opinion and the accompanying representation letters contemplated by
Section 6.3(e) hereof.

_Section 8.5 _ _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.



_Section 8.6_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.



 

64 _Section 8.7_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Zhone Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof (including (i) that
certain letter agreement between the parties regarding "exclusivity" dated
July 8, 2003 (the "Exclusivity Agreement") (provided, that nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for a breach of the
Exclusivity Agreement) and (ii) that certain Confidential Disclosure Agreement
dated June 16, 2003 between the parties), and except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person
any rights or remedies hereunder.



_Section 8.8_ _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.



_Section 8.9_ _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than pursuant to Section 5.12, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.



_Section 8.10_ _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties.



_Section 8.11_ _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury._



(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles.



(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Delaware State court, or Federal court of the United States of America,
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (A) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (B) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such Federal court, (C) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court and (D) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other



 

65  jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.



(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.11(c).



_Section 8.12_ _Disclosure_. The provision of monetary or other quantitative
thresholds for disclosure by any party (whether in that partys disclosure
schedule or otherwise) does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a
standard of materiality hereunder.



_Section 8.13_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



_Section 8.14_ _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any bond, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

66 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, Merger Sub and Zhone have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
