shall, using all reasonable efforts, cause a statement of Working Capital as
of the Closing Date (the "Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement" and,
as finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.4, the
"Closing Date Working Capital Statement") together with working papers setting
out details of the calculations to be delivered to the Purchaser, which such
Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall (i) set out the Working
Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing (such draft Working Capital, as
finally determined in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 2.4, referred to as the "Closing Date Working
Capital") and (ii) be determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and on a basis consistent with the indicative
calculation set forth in Schedule 2.4(a) and the Business' past practice used
in calculating the components of Working Capital for preparation of the
Financial Statements (except that, to the extent that the past practices of
the Business used in determining the book value of any category or category
item of any asset or liability are not consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles, such past practices shall not be used in determining
the book value of such category or category item of asset or liability in the
Closing Date Working Capital). Any amounts included in the Closing Date
Working Capital Statement denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars
shall be converted into U.S. dollars as set forth at, or as near as possible
to, 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date on the Reuters World Currency
Page for such currency, or, in the event that such rate does not appear on the
applicable Reuters currency page, the spot rate of exchange of Bank of
America, N.A. in the market where its foreign currency exchange operations in
respect of such currency are then being conducted at, or as near as possible
to, 4:00 pm (Eastern time) on the Closing Date. The Purchasing Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with the Vendor and its accountants to the extent
required to prepare the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement,
including providing the Vendor and its accountants access at all reasonable
times to the Corporation's personnel, books and records for purposes of
preparing the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement.

  

  

(b) During the period from the date the Draft Closing Date Working Capital
Statement is delivered by the Vendor to the Purchaser through the date such
statement is finally determined, the Vendor shall provide the Purchaser and
its accountants access at all reasonable times to the work papers of the
Vendor and its accountants in connection with its review of the Draft Closing
Date Working Capital Statement, subject to the execution of customary
confidentiality and other undertakings, and the Vendor shall make reasonably
available to the Purchaser and its accountants individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement in order to
respond to inquiries of the Purchaser related thereto and procure their
cooperation.

  

  

(c) If the Purchaser notifies the Vendor that the Purchaser agrees with the
Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof or fails to deliver notice to the Vendor of its disagreement
therewith within such thirty (30) day period, the Draft Closing Date Working
Capital Statement as it pertains to the completeness and accuracy of or method
of calculation of any amount reflected in the Draft Closing Date Working
Capital Statement, shall be conclusive and binding on the Vendor and the
Purchaser and the parties shall be deemed to have agreed thereto, in the first
case, on the date the Purchaser receives the notice and, in the second case,
on such thirtieth (30th) day. If the Purchaser disagrees with the Draft
Closing Date Working Capital Statement as it pertains to the completeness and
accuracy of any amount reflected in the Draft Closing Date Working Capital
Statement or the calculation of Closing Date Working Capital as set forth
therein such that the Purchaser alleges that the calculation of Closing Date
Working Capital is inaccurate such that the inaccuracy results in a difference
of more than [redacted], then the Purchaser shall notify the Vendor of its
disagreement (the "Dispute Notice") within such thirty (30) day period
together with reasonable particulars of the basis of such dispute, including
the Purchaser's position of the amounts in dispute (and the resulting
Purchaser's position on the Closing Date Working Capital). In such event, the
Vendor and the Purchaser shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve their
differences with respect thereto within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by
the Vendor of the Dispute Notice. [Description: dollar amount redacted.]

  

  

(d) Any dispute over the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement or the
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital set forth in the Dispute Notice
not resolved by the Purchaser and the Vendor within such fifteen (15) day
period shall be submitted to the Accounting Referee to determine such dispute,
and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Accounting Referee shall allow the Purchaser and the Vendor to present their
respective positions regarding the dispute (provided that, for greater
certainty, such presentations are limited to matters described in the Dispute
Notice) and each of the Purchaser and the Vendor shall have the right to
present additional documents, materials and other information, and make an
oral presentation to the Accounting Referee, regarding such dispute and the
Accounting Referee shall consider such additional documents, materials and
other information and such oral presentation. Any such other documents,
materials or other information shall be copied to each of the Purchaser and
the Vendor and each of the Vendor and the Purchaser shall be entitled to
attend any such oral presentation. The Accounting Referee shall determine,
based solely on such presentations from the Vendor and the Purchaser and not
by independent review, only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in
the Dispute Notice and shall render a written report (the "Adjustment Report")
to the Vendor and the Purchaser in which the Accounting Referee shall, after
considering all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement and the Closing Date Working Capital set forth therein on that
basis. The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
Accounting Referee's determination with respect to each of the disputed items
or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be
made to the Draft Closing Date Working Capital Statement and the Closing Date
Working Capital, together with supporting calculations. In resolving any
disputed item, the Accounting Referee: (i) shall be bound to the principles of
this Section 2.4 (including Schedule 2.4(a)), (ii) shall limit its review to
matters specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and remaining unresolved
after the 15 day period referred to in Section 2.4(c) above, and (iii) shall
not assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for such item
claimed by either party or lower than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either party; provided, however, that to the extent the determination of
the value of any disputed item affects any other item used in calculating the
Closing Date Working Capital, such effect may be taken into account by the
Accounting Referee. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Referee to complete its work and render its determination
within thirty (30) calendar days of its engagement. All fees and expenses
relating to the work of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Vendor,
on the one hand, and by the Purchasing Parties, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion as the Vendor or the Purchaser, respectively, may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Accounting Referee (such inverse proportion for each
party shall be the positive value obtained for each party by dividing (1) the
difference of (A) the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital proposed by
such party and (B) the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital established
by the Accounting Referee by (2) the difference between (A) the amount of the
Closing Date Working Capital proposed by the Vendor and (B) the amount of
Closing Date Working Capital proposed by the Purchaser), which proportionate
allocation shall also be determined by the Accounting Referee and be in the
Adjustment Report.

  

  

(e) Any interest payable pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i) or Section 2.3(b)(ii)
shall be paid at the Prime Rate from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the date of payment.

  

  

Section 2.5 Settlement Date.

  

  

On the later of the second Business Day following (i) the date on which the
Vendor and the Purchaser agree to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement
(or are deemed to have agreed to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement)
and (ii) the date on which a determination in respect of a Closing Date
Statement Dispute is made by the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.4(d)
(such later date, the "Settlement Date"), the Closing Date Working Capital
shall be determined and the payments contemplated by Section 2.3(b) shall be
made based on the Purchase Price as calculated using such Closing Date Working
Capital in accordance with Section 2.2(a) (such Purchase Price as finally
determined, the "Final Purchase Price").

  

  

Section 2.6 Payment and Location of Closing.

  

  

Any reference in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement to payment shall mean payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in United States dollars to the bank account or accounts
designated by the recipient of such payment in writing to the party making
such payment, as the case may be, not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the date of such payment. The Closing shall be held at the Vendor's offices at
12:01 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date or such other place or time as
may be agreed by the Vendor and the Parent.

  

  

Section 2.7 Third Party Consents.

  

  

To the extent that any Business Asset is not, as a matter of Law or by its
terms, (i) assignable or transferable or (ii) assignable or transferable
without the consent of another Person, in each case pursuant to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement,
then there shall be no assignment or attempted assignment of such Business
Asset pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement if such assignment
or attempted assignment would constitute a breach of Law or the terms of such
Business Asset. Prior to and after the Closing, the Vendor and the Purchasing
Parties shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to promptly obtain the
consent of such Person to the assignment of any such Business Asset to the
Corporation in all cases in which such consent is or may be required for such
assignment. To the extent that any of the Business Assets are not transferable
by Law or by their terms, the Vendor and the Purchasing Parties shall
cooperate and use all reasonable efforts in promptly making appropriate
arrangements for the novation or re-issuance of the Business Assets in the
name of the Corporation or otherwise as the Purchasing Parties shall specify
(acting reasonably). If and to the extent that such consent, novation or re-
issuance cannot be obtained, the Vendor shall use all reasonable efforts to
preserve the benefits under the Business Assets (the "Business Asset
Benefits") for the Corporation, at the expense, charged at the rates set forth
in Schedule C of the Manufacturing and Support Agreement, of the Purchasing
Parties, but the Purchase Price under this Agreement shall not be adjusted. In
order that the Corporation may realize substantially all of the benefit of the
Business Asset Benefits, the Vendor will, at the request and expense, charged
at the rates set forth in Schedule C of the Manufacturing and Support
Agreement, and under the direction of the Purchasing Parties, in the name of
the Vendor or otherwise as the Purchasing Parties shall specify (acting
reasonably), hold such Business Asset Benefits for a period of up to five
years for the benefit of the Corporation and will take all such action and do
or cause to be done all such things as shall, in the opinion of the Purchasing
Parties (acting reasonably), be necessary or proper in order that the
obligations of the Vendor may be performed in such manner that the value of
such Business Asset Benefits are preserved and enure to the benefit of the
Corporation, and that the collection of moneys due and payable to the Vendor
in and under such Business Asset Benefits are received by the Corporation. The
Vendor's obligations under this Section 2.7 with respect to any particular
Business Asset Benefit shall terminate if the failure to obtain the necessary
consent, novation or re-issuance in respect of the relevant Business Asset is
a result of (i) the failure of the Purchaser or its Affiliates to comply with
the terms of this Section 2.7, (ii) the negligence or willful misconduct of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates or (iii) is a result of the identity or the
legal or regulatory status of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (provided
that with respect to a failure in connection with the foregoing item (iii), to
the extent the failure is curable, then the Purchaser shall be entitled to a
six (6) month period to cure such failure). The Vendor's obligations under
this Section 2.7 shall not require it to undertake or omit to undertake any
activity that violates applicable Laws or that would materially compromise its
compliance program, regulatory status or any other licence, permit or
registration with respect to the Business or any other of its businesses.
Prior to and after the Closing, the parties shall consult with each other on a
monthly basis as to the status of consents, re-issuances or novations in
respect of the Business Assets and with respect to the status of, and proposed
approach of the parties to, the treatment of the Business Asset Benefits. The
provisions of this Section 2.7 shall not affect the right of the Purchasing
Parties not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if
the condition to its obligations hereunder contained in Section 8.4 has not
been fulfilled. The obligations of the Vendor under this Section 2.7 are
subject to compliance by the Corporation of its obligations under section 2(d)
of the Transition Services Agreement.

Corporation. There are no irrevocable proxies or voting agreements with
respect to any securities of the Corporation or securities convertible into,

Vendor is not, and the Corporation will not (i) be a partner, beneficiary,
trustee, co-tenant, joint-venturer or otherwise a participant in any
partnership, trust, joint venture, co-tenancy or similar jointly owned
business undertaking and (ii) have an investment interest (whether equity or

of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the Asset Purchase

to be in full force and effect for the purposes of this Section 3.5).

Section 3.13 Material Business Contracts.

  

  

(a) Section 3.13 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Material Business
Contracts as of the date hereof. Except as disclosed in Section 3.13 of the
Disclosure Schedule, all Material Business Contracts are in full force and
effect and constitute valid and binding rights and obligations of the Vendor,
and after giving effect to the Asset Purchase Agreement and upon Closing, will
constitute binding rights and obligations of the Corporation (except for
Material Business Contracts held for the benefit of the Corporation pursuant
to Section 2.7), and, to the Knowledge of the Vendor, constitute valid and
binding rights and obligations of the other parties thereto in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions.

the Knowledge of the Vendor, any other party thereto, is in breach or default
of any provision of any Material Business Contract, and (ii) to the Knowledge
of the Vendor, no event or circumstance has occurred (including the purchase

Section 3.14 Intellectual Property Rights.

  

  

Except for Vendor Background Technology, Section 3.14 of the Disclosure

timely manner. To the Knowledge of the Vendor, the Intellectual Property
disclosed in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule is not being infringed or
misused by any other Person. To the Knowledge of the Vendor, the use of the

conducted does not breach, violate, infringe or interfere with any rights of
any third Person or require payment for the use of any Intellectual Property
of another. Neither of the Vendor or the Corporation has received any written
notice from a third Person claiming that the continuing conduct of the

have an effect material to the Business.

including any Vendor Pension Plans (individually, referred to as a "Vendor
Benefit Plan" and, collectively, referred to as the "Vendor Benefit Plans").

  

  

(b) Copies of each Vendor Benefit Plan or a summary thereof have been made
available to the Purchaser prior to the date hereof and all material data
necessary to administer each Vendor Benefit Plan is in the possession of the
Vendor or its agents and is in a form which is sufficient for the proper
administration of the Vendor Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and all
Laws and Guidelines and such data is complete and correct.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Vendor
has no formal plan and has made no promise or commitment, whether legally
binding or not, to create any additional benefit plans which would be
considered to be a Vendor Benefit Plan once created or to improve or change
the benefits provided under any Vendor Benefit Plan.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Vendor Benefit Plans provide benefits beyond retirement or other

respect of such Vendor Benefit Plan), all Laws, Guidelines and the Collective
Bargaining Agreements, as applicable. The Vendor has not received, in the last
three years, any notice from any Person questioning or challenging such
compliance, and to the Knowledge of the Vendor, there has not been any such
notice beyond the last three years. There is no investigation by any
Governmental Authority or Claim (other than routine claims for payment of
benefits), or to the Knowledge of the Vendor pending or threatened involving
any Vendor Benefit Plan or their assets, and no facts exist which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such investigation or Claim (other
than routine claims for payment of benefits).

  

  

Section 3.16 Employees; Labour Relations.

  

  

(a) The Disclosure Schedule lists any and all current employment contracts
between the Employees and the Vendor and the Employees and the Corporation,
and such employment contracts have been delivered or made available to the
Purchaser. Except where listed in the Disclosure Schedule, there are no
employment contracts which are not terminable on the giving of reasonable
notice in accordance with applicable Law, nor are there any employment
contracts providing for cash, other compensation, benefits or contingent

respect to the Employees and no Collective Bargaining Agreement is currently
being negotiated by the Vendor or the Corporation with respect to the
Employees. There are no outstanding or, to the knowledge of the Vendor,
threatened, unfair labour practices, complaints or applications, including any
proceedings which could result in a certified bargaining agent for any
Employees, and there have not been any such proceedings within the last three
years.

  

  

Section 3.17 Taxes and Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) As of the Closing, the Corporation will (i) have filed or caused to be
filed on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental Authority all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it and will have duly, completely and
correctly reported all income and all other amounts and information required
to be reported thereon, and (ii) have duly and timely paid or caused to be

with the sale, assignment, conveyance and transfer of the Business Assets to
the Corporation.

Liens) upon any of the assets of the Corporation and no failure, if any, of
the Vendor to duly and timely pay all Taxes, including all installments on

result in a Lien on the assets of the Corporation.

  

  

(c) There are no actions, suits or other proceedings or investigations or
claims in progress, pending or threatened against (i) the Corporation in
respect of any Taxes (as of the Closing) or (ii) against the Vendor in respect
of any Taxes which may result in a Lien on the assets of the Corporation, and
there are not currently any outstanding reassessments or written inquiries
which have been issued or raised by any Governmental Authority relating to
Taxes which may result in a Lien on the assets of the Corporation.

  

  

(d) The Vendor has, and as of the Closing the Corporation will have, duly and
timely collected all amounts on account of any sales or transfer taxes,
including goods and services, harmonized sales and provincial or territorial
sales taxes, required by Law to be collected by it, and has (and in the case

such Tax Returns or any Tax Returns filed by the Corporation prior to the
Closing (and the work papers of the Corporation and its accountants used in
the preparation thereof), in each case, prior to the filing thereof (but in no
event less than thirty (30) days prior to such filing). Except as required by
Law, without the Vendor's prior written consent, none of the Purchasing
Parties or the Corporation shall take any position on any Tax Return
(including any amendment thereto) for, or agree to any settlement relating to,
any taxable period which might result in any increase in Tax for any Vendor
Tax Period.

  

  

(d) If a refund of Taxes (to the extent not reflected in the Closing Date

Parties shall cause the Corporation to pay, within thirty (30) days of
receipt, the amount of the Refund to the Vendor.

prepared and filed as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.5 Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

  

Prior to the Closing, the Vendor shall establish the Corporation and the
Vendor shall, and shall cause the Corporation to, enter into the Asset
Purchase Agreement. The form of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be
modified (and no provisions shall be waived) without the prior written consent
of the Parent. The Vendor shall, and shall cause the Corporation to, on and
before the Closing on the Closing Date, perform their respective obligations
under the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Purchasing Parties shall, following
the Closing on the Closing Date, cause the Corporation to perform its
obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement. The transfer of the Business
Assets to the Corporation under the Asset Purchase Agreement shall take place
immediately prior to the Closing. Provided that the Vendor and the Corporation
have made an election under section 167 of the ETA and its equivalent in
Quebec pursuant to section 75 of the Act respecting the Quebec sales tax, if
applicable, or an election under section 156 of the ETA and its equivalent in
Quebec pursuant to section 334 of the Act respecting the Quebec sales tax with
respect to the transfer of the Business Assets to the Corporation, the
Purchasing Parties, on the one hand, and the Vendor, on the other hand, shall
each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all applicable transfer Taxes,
sales Taxes, goods and services Taxes, harmonized sales Taxes (including
GST/HST), value added Taxes, registration fees, duties or other like charges,
including land transfer Taxes, payable upon and in connection with the sale,

Section 7.6 Corporate Action, Resignations, Releases, Indemnification.

  

  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Vendor shall cause all necessary corporate
action to be taken for the purpose of approving the transfer of the Purchased
Shares to the Purchaser. At or prior to such time, the Vendor shall also
obtain the resignations of all the directors and officers of the Corporation
and a release from such individuals of any and all claims they may have
against the Corporation (other than in respect of unpaid salaries or fees or
other accrued compensation), in form and substance satisfactory to the
Purchasing Parties and their counsel, in exchange for a release by the
Purchasing Parties and the Corporation in favour of the resigning directors
and officers of the Corporation of any and all claims the Corporation or the
Purchasing Parties may have against them in relation to their approval of the
Asset Purchase Agreement. If requested by the Parent, the Vendor shall cause
nominees of the Purchaser to be elected or appointed directors of the
Corporation to fill any vacancies.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, the Purchasing Parties shall, and shall cause
the Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and to also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each current and former
director, officer, and employee of the Corporation against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable legal fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, inquiry, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such persons' services as a
director, officer or employee of the Corporation in approving and carrying out
the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. Neither the
Purchasing Parties nor the Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or threatened claim, inquiry, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation involving or naming such a person or arising out of or related
to such a person's service as a director, officer, or employee of the
Corporation or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Corporation at or prior to the Closing without the prior written consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of such person.

  

  

Section 7.7 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Save in respect of any Employees that will transfer to the Purchaser or an
Affiliate of the Purchaser automatically by operation of law pursuant to the
terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, before the Closing, the Vendor shall
cause the Corporation to, or an Affiliate of the Purchaser will, offer in
writing to employ, effective as of the Closing Date, the Employees (the
"Offers of Employment"). The Offers of Employment shall be made within
fourteen (14) Business Days after the date of the execution of this Agreement
and each Offer of Employment shall be on terms and conditions of employment
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date, taking into consideration only those Vendor Benefit
Plans disclosed in Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule. The Purchaser
shall set the terms and conditions of the Offers of Employment and provide a
general overview of such terms and conditions to the Vendor for review prior
to the execution of the Agreement. The Vendor shall use all reasonable efforts
to maintain good relations with the Employees. The Vendor shall be solely
responsible for all termination and severance costs that may arise if any
Employees do not accept the Offers of Employment except where any such Offer
of Employment is not substantially similar in the aggregate.

  

  

(b) The Purchasing Parties will establish or otherwise make available,
effective as of the Closing Date, benefit and retirement plans for the
Employees who accept an Offer of Employment (the "Purchaser Benefit Plans").

  

  

(c) [redacted] [Description: employee matter liabilities of the Vendor.]

  

  

(d) The Vendor Benefit Plans shall retain responsibility for payment of all
benefit claims Incurred by Employees (and their eligible spouses,
beneficiaries and dependants) prior to the Closing Date, provided such amounts
are payable in accordance with the terms of such Vendor Benefit Plans. The
Purchaser Benefit Plans shall be responsible for payment of all benefit claims
Incurred by Employees (and their eligible spouses, beneficiaries and
dependants) on and after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such
Purchaser Benefit Plans. If any Employee who accepts an Offer of Employment
suffers a disability after the Closing Date and such disability would be
considered under the terms of any Vendor Benefit Plan, as it read as at the
Closing Date, to be a recurrence of a disability that occurred prior to the
Closing Date, then the Vendor shall make, or cause to be made from the
relevant Vendor Benefit Plan, disability payments to such Employee in relation
to such recurring disability.

  

  

(e) The Vendor shall cause the Employees who accept an Offer of Employment to
cease participation in the Vendor Pension Plans effective as of a date prior
to the day on which the Employees become employed by the Corporation. Vendor
shall assume and retain responsibility for any and all liabilities or
obligations under the Vendor Pension Plans, excluding only the liabilities in
respect of the Transferred Plan Assets. For greater certainty, Vendor shall
assume and retain responsibility for any and all liability or responsibility
for any Pension Plan Unfunded Liability.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, Vendor shall, if
requested by the Purchasing Parties, permit the Employees who accept an Offer
of Employment (and their eligible spouses, beneficiaries and dependents) to
continue to participate in and receive benefits under any Vendor Benefit
Plans, where permissible under the terms of the agreement with the plan
provider in each country, excluding any Vendor Pension Plans, for a
transitional period following the Closing Date on the terms and subject to the
conditions to be agreed upon by the Vendor and the Purchasing Entities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Purchasing Parties have requested
that Employees who accept an Offer of Employment be permitted to continue to
participate in and receive benefits under a Vendor Benefit Plan for a
transitional period following the Closing Date, Vendor shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consent from a plan provider to amend a Vendor
Benefit Plan to allow for such participation where it is not permitted under
the terms of the agreement with the plan provider.

Section 10.6 Notice and Defence of Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event that any Person shall incur or suffer any Losses in respect
of which indemnification may be sought by such Person pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 10, the Person seeking to be indemnified hereunder
(the "Indemnified Party") shall assert a claim for indemnification by written
notice to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") stating with reasonable specificity the nature and basis of such claim
(including the breach, inaccuracy, non-performance or provision of the
Agreement to which such claim relates), a reasonable estimate of the amount of
such claim and including copies of any relevant third party pleadings and
other demands (a "Notice"). In the case of Losses arising by reason of any
third party claim, the Notice shall be given within fifteen (15) days of the
filing or other written assertion of any such claim against the Indemnified
Party.

  


 

  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party on request
all information and documentation reasonably necessary to support and verify
any Losses which the Indemnified Party believes give rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonable
access to all premises, books, records and personnel in the possession or
under the control of the Indemnified Party which would have bearing on such
claim.

  


 

  

(c) In the case of any third party claims for which indemnification is sought,
the Indemnifying Party shall have (at the cost of the Indemnifying Party) the
right to: (i) conduct and control any proceedings or negotiations, (ii)
perform and control or direct the performance of any required activities,
including remedial or other activities under Laws, (iii) take all other steps
to settle or defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any such claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) unless
the settlement includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party with
respect to the claim), and (iv) employ counsel to contest any such claim or
liability provided, in any such case, that the Indemnifying Party first
acknowledges in writing the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify
the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms contained in this Article
10. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct and control any
proceedings itself, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to fully
participate at its own expense and by its own counsel in any proceedings
relating to any third-party claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within sixty
(60) days after delivery of the Notice to Indemnifying Party (the "Dispute
Period"), notify the Indemnified Party of its intention as to the conduct and
control of the defense of such claim, provided that the Indemnified Party and
its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel at all
times. Until the Indemnified Party has received notice of the Indemnifying
Party's election whether to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall take
reasonable steps to defend (but may not settle) such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume the defense of any such claim, or
the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period of the Indemnifying Party's election to defend such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall defend against such claim (provided that the
Indemnified Party shall not settle any such claim without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)) and the reasonable expenses of all proceedings,
contests or lawsuits in respect of such claims (including the reasonable costs
and reasonable expenses of no more than one law firm in each relevant
jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties) shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party but only if the Indemnifying Party is responsible pursuant hereto to
indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the third party claim and, if
applicable, only to the extent required by Section 10.3 and Section 10.5, as
the case may be, and subject to the limitations of this Section 10.6 and
Section 10.7. Regardless of whether the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party agree to cooperate fully with one another in connection
therewith and to keep each other reasonably informed of the status of the
claim and any related proceeding and the Indemnified Party shall take no
action or make any admissions or statements not required by applicable Law
which would adversely affect the defense of any such claim.

  


 

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim under
this Article 10 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period, the Losses arising from any such claim shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 10.3, Section 10.5 and Section 10.7, be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 10.3, Section 10.5 and Section 10.7, pay
the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final
determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, either party may seek
a resolution of such dispute by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

  


 

  

Section 10.7 Further Limitations and Qualifications on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary the Vendor shall have no
liability under this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.2) with
respect to any matter to the extent the expense, loss or liability comprising
the Loss with respect to such matter has been reserved or provided for in the
Financial Statements or taken into account in the calculation of the Closing
Date Working Capital.

  

  

(b) For greater certainty, the amount which the Indemnified Party is required
to pay to, or on behalf of, the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 10
shall be determined on an after-Tax basis.

  

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall make any indemnification payments determined
to be payable to the Indemnified Party hereunder without regard to any
expectation that the Indemnified Party will recover insurance proceeds or
other amounts as a result of the matter giving rise to the claim for which
indemnification payments are to be made. The Indemnified Party shall have an
obligation to promptly seek to recover or make a claim for insurance proceeds
or other amounts available as a result of any matter giving rise to an
indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party.
In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of any
indemnification payment made by it, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the claim to which the
indemnification payment relates. If the Indemnified Party receives any
insurance proceeds or other amounts as a result of the matter giving rise to
any indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party prior to the date upon
which the Indemnifying Party is given notice of the claim, the Indemnifying
Party's indemnification obligation with respect to such claim shall be reduced
by the amount of any such insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds or
other amounts as a result of the matter giving rise to any indemnification
claim of the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party after the
Indemnifying Party has paid such indemnification claim to the Indemnified
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over any such insurance
proceeds or other amounts received to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of
the payments made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party on the
claim.

  

  

(d) Other than in respect of any fraud or wilful misconduct and other than
those provided for in other documents or instruments delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, from and after Closing, except with respect to matters covered
by Section 2.4, the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Vendor Indemnified Parties arising out of this
Agreement or otherwise arising out of the Purchasing Parties' acquisition of
the Purchased Shares, whether based on tort, contract, statutory or common law
remedy or equitable remedy or otherwise, including any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, non-fulfillment or failure to perform and covenant or
agreement or otherwise, shall be to assert a claim for indemnification under
the indemnification provisions of this Article 10 and each of the parties
covenants that it (and the Indemnified Parties) will not seek to obtain any
remedy except as provided in this Article 10. No Person who was an officer,
director, employee or shareholder of the Vendor or the Corporation prior to
the Closing shall have any liability to make any payment in respect of any
breach of any representation or warranty or non-performance of any covenant or
agreement made in or pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(e) The indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to a specific claim for which indemnification is
provided under this Agreement shall extend beyond the applicable time period
for indemnification set forth in Section 10.1 with respect to such specific
claim until it has been fully discharged or resolved or settled; provided,
however, a Notice shall have been given to the Indemnifying Party on or prior
to the end of such time period.

  

  

(f) The Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event, fact or circumstance which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses. If the Indemnified Party
shall fail to take such steps, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to indemnify any Indemnified Party for the Losses that would have
been avoided if the Indemnified Party had taken such steps.

  

  

Section 10.8 Indemnification Adjustment to Purchase Price.

  

  

Any amounts payable under this Article 10 shall constitute an adjustment in
the Purchase Price.

  

  

Section 10.9 Indemnification with respect to Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

  

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Vendor shall
indemnify and save harmless the Purchaser Parties on an after-Tax basis, from
and against all claims which may be made or brought against the Purchaser
Parties for any and all amounts, including those relating to Taxes, which they
may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection
with, relating to or arising as a result of the Asset Purchase Agreement;
except that in respect of applicable transfer Taxes, sales Taxes, goods and
services Taxes, harmonized sales Taxes (including GST/HST), value added Taxes,
registration fees, duties or other like charges, including land transfer
Taxes, payable upon and in connection with the sale, assignment, conveyance
and transfer of the Business Assets to the Corporation, provided that the
Vendor and the Corporation have made an election under section 167 of the ETA
and its equivalent in Quebec pursuant to section 75 of the Act respecting the
Quebec sales tax, if applicable, or an election under section 156 of the ETA
and its equivalent in Quebec pursuant to section 334 of the Act respecting the
Quebec sales tax with respect to the transfer of the Business Assets to the
Corporation, the Vendor's indemnification obligation shall only apply to fifty
percent (50%) of such Taxes, fees, duties or charges.

Section 12.3 Amendment.

  

  

No amendment to this Agreement may be made unless agreed to by the parties in
writing.

  

  

Section 12.4 Schedules.

  

  

(a) The Schedules shall be deemed to be attached hereto and made a part
hereof. All references herein to this Agreement shall include the Schedules.

  

  

(b) Nothing in the Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. The Schedules and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and
limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Vendor
or the Purchasing Parties, as the case may be, contained in this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any of such
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

  

  

(c) The disclosure of any item in any Schedule (or section thereof) is a
disclosure of that item solely for the purpose of the specific Section or
Subsection set out in such Schedule except and only to the extent that the
relevance to other Sections or Subsections of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent from the actual text of the disclosure.

  

  

(d) No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any Schedule
(or any section thereof) shall be construed as an admission or indication that
such item is required to be referred to or disclosed in any Schedule (or any
section thereof). Inclusion of any item in a Schedule (or any section thereof)
does not constitute a determination by the representing party that such item
is material and shall not be deemed to establish a standard of materiality. No
disclosure in a Schedule (or any section thereof) relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law, Guideline or any potential adverse
contingency shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred or that such adverse
contingency will actually occur.

  

  

Section 12.5 Enforcement of Agreement.

  

  

The parties agree that irreparable damage to any party for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the failure by
any party to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) was not performed in
accordance with its specified terms or was otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each party shall be entitled to an injunction or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the party is
entitled at Law or in equity, and any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief is hereby waived.

  

  

Section 12.6 Severability.

  

  

Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law. If any
portion of this Agreement is declared invalid for any reason in any
jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect upon the remaining
portions of this Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect as if
this Agreement had been executed with the invalid portions thereof deleted;
provided, however, if such severability will negate in any material respect
the monetary terms of this Agreement, then the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to amend the invalid terms in a manner so that such terms shall not be
invalid and will not modify in any material respect the monetary terms of this
Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Furthermore, the entirety
of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all other
jurisdictions.

  

  

Section 12.7 Entire Understanding.

  

  

This Agreement, including the Schedules hereto, and except as expressly
referenced herein, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and
all prior discussions, negotiations, letters of intent or agreements in
principle between them.

  

  

Section 12.8 Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

  

  

Except for the provisions of Article 10 relating to the Vendor Indemnified
Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the exclusive benefit of the parties and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors
and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to,
nor shall it, confer in any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The
parties agree that, for the purpose of giving enforceable rights under this
Agreement (i) to the Vendor Indemnified Parties who are not party to this
Agreement, the Vendor is contracting as the agent of such Persons and will
hold the rights of such Persons in trust for them and (ii) to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties who are not party to this Agreement, the Purchasing
Parties are contracting as the agents of such Persons and will hold the rights
of such Persons in trust for them.

  

  

Section 12.9 Governing Law.

  

  

This Agreement is and shall be deemed to be a contract entered into and made
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein and shall in all respects be governed, construed, applied
and enforced in accordance with said laws, without reference to applicable
conflict of laws rules or principles.

  

  

Section 12.10 Choice of Forum and Consent to Jurisdiction.

  

  

Any action arising out of or under this Agreement, any other document,
instrument or agreement contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of such other
documents, instruments or agreements, shall be brought only in a federal or
provincial court having jurisdiction and venue in Ontario, Canada, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts and agrees that venue in Ontario is proper. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, final judgment against such party (a certified copy of which
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and of the amount of any indebtedness
of such party hereunder) in any such legal action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on an
unsatisfied judgment or similar proceeding. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
or otherwise, in any legal action or proceeding, any defense or any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named Ontario
courts for any reason, including claims that such party may be immune from the
above-described legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, or otherwise), or that such
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient or otherwise improper forum or that
this Agreement or any of the other aforementioned documents, instruments or
agreements, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts, or that the same are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction
other than Ontario. Each of the parties hereby specifically agrees that it
shall not bring any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or under this
Agreement, any other document, instrument or agreement contemplated herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any of such other documents, instruments or agreements, in the courts of
any jurisdiction other than the above-named courts of Ontario, that any such
action brought by any party shall be dismissed upon the basis of the
agreements, terms and provisions set forth in this Section 12.10, and that any
order or judgment obtained in any such action from a court other than the
courts of Ontario shall be void ab initio; provided, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 12.10, any party may bring and enforce an
action seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 12.11 Waiver of Trial by Jury.

  

  

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, LITIGATION,
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF
THIS PROVISION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY
AND BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY
JURY, AND THAT SUCH PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED
BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

  

  

Section 12.12 Assignability.

  

  

No party hereto shall sell, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party and any attempt to do so shall be void.

  

  

Section 12.13 Counterparts; Delivery by Electronic Transmission.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which when so executed
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or other
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 12.14 Public Announcements.

  

  

No public announcements or other publicity regarding the transactions referred
to herein shall be made by the Purchasing Parties or the Vendor at any time
prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) as
to form, timing and manner of distribution or publication, except (i) to the
extent otherwise required by Law in which case the parties will used good
faith efforts to consult with each other on the substance of the press release
to the extent practicable, and (ii) each party may disclose to its current and
prospective banks, shareholders, partners, investors and advisors the name of
the other party, the date of the transaction, the price and the key terms
under this Agreement. The parties shall also obtain the other parties' prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) of any press release to be issued immediately following the
Closing announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

In February 2009 training was being carried out at a user site in the US using
a newly modified TheraSphere Administration set. During training, a small
amount of air was observed in the outlet line. Upon investigation, it was
determined that the use of the pinch clamp that was designed to prevent this
type of occurrence was not described in the instructions for use. A user
bulletin was issued to all sites that had been trained in the use of the
modified administration set, and device correction reports were submitted to
Health Canada, the USFDA and to the competent authorities in the EU. These
notifications were all completed by the end of February 2009. Package inserts
were updated to reflect use of the pinch clamp, the updated package inserts
were implemented in September 2009 in Canada and the US, and in October 2009
for the EU. This event is documented in Field Action File # TS090201.

In March 2011 it was discovered that two TheraSphere Administration Accessory
kits in the field had the same serial number, one in Germany and the other in
Turkey. Work instructions were prepared for relabeling the kits in the field.
The kits were relabeled in the field by the Vendor's employees. It was
determined that the incident was reportable to the German competent authority,
but was not required for the Turkish competent authority. A manufacturers
incident report was sent to the German competent authority in April, copied to
our Notified Body (BSI) and our Authorized Representative in Europe (Best
Medical Belgium). This event is documented in Field Action File # TS110301.

In February 2009 training was being carried out at a user site in the US using
a newly modified TheraSphere Administration set. During training, a small
amount of air was observed in the outlet line. Upon investigation, it was
determined that the use of the pinch clamp that was designed to prevent this
type of occurrence was not described in the instructions for use. A user
bulletin was issued to all sites that had been trained in the use of the
modified administration set, and device correction reports were submitted to
Health Canada, the USFDA and to the competent authorities in the EU. These
notifications were all completed by the end of February 2009. Package inserts
were updated to reflect use of the pinch clamp, the updated package inserts
were implemented in September 2009 in Canada and the US, and in October 2009
for the EU. This event is documented in Field Action File # TS090201.

In March 2011 it was discovered that two TheraSphere Administration Accessory
kits in the field had the same serial number, one in Germany and the other in
Turkey. Work instructions were prepared for relabeling the kits in the field.
The kits were relabeled in the field by the Vendor's employees. It was
determined that the incident was reportable to the German competent authority,
but was not required for the Turkish competent authority. A manufacturers
incident report was sent to the German competent authority in April, copied to
our Notified Body (BSI) and our Authorized Representative in Europe (Best
Medical Belgium). This event is documented in Field Action File # TS110301.

Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, all capitalized terms used in this
Agreement shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Purchase
Agreement.

  

    

2.

  |  

Non-Competition

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Each of the Vendor and Vendor Parent severally covenant with the Purchaser,
Purchaser Parent and the Company that they shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to, for a period of ten years (the "Restricted Period"), within
the Territory, except to the extent contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement, the Manufacturing Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement,
either alone or in conjunction with any individual, partnership, firm,
association, syndicate, company or other entity, whether as principal, agent,
consultant, employee, shareholder (other than a holding of shares listed on a
recognized North American stock exchange that does not exceed two percent (2%)
of the outstanding shares so listed, provided that none of the Vendor, any of
its Affiliates or any Person acting jointly or in concert with the Vendor is
involved in any manner whatsoever with the management of such listed issuer),
or in any other manner, whatsoever, directly or indirectly:

  

    

(a)

  |  

carry on or be engaged in, or be interested in the Business or advise, invest,
lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name or the
tradename "TheraSphere", or any confusingly similar tradename, to be used or
employed by any person, firm, association, syndicate, company or corporation
engaged in or concerned with or interested in the Business; or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

manufacture, process, sell, distribute (wholesale or retail), promote, or
market any Y90 glass microsphere products related to the treatment of cancer,
whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any third party (other than the
Company and its Affiliates during the term of the Manufacturing Agreement and
the Transition Services Agreement).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

3.

  |  

Restrictive Covenants

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The Vendor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions
reasonably necessary to assign to the Purchaser, all agreements between the
Vendor or its Affiliates and employees or any other persons or companies
solely to the extent such agreements that directly or indirectly prohibit or
restrict:

  

    

(a)

  |  

competition with the Business in the Territory; or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

the use of any confidential information, including customer lists, used in
connection with the Business carried on by the Vendor or its Affiliates;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

and the Vendor and its Affiliates shall not waive or release any such employee
or other person from any such obligations under any such agreements.

  

    

4.

  |  

Business Combinations

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Neither the Vendor nor the Vendor Parent shall (and each of the Vendor and the
Vendor Parent shall cause all of their Affiliates not to) sell a material
portion of the assets of its radiopharmaceutical business during the
Restricted Period to any third party unless the Vendor causes such third party
to enter into a non-competition agreement with the Company, the Purchaser and
the Purchaser Parent in respect of the Business on substantially the same
terms as this Agreement. If, during the Restricted Period, the Vendor or the
Vendor Parent or any of their respective Affiliates is acquired by a third
party in any circumstances where such acquisition includes a material portion
of the radiopharmaceutical business, then the Vendor will continue to be
subject to the Vendor's obligations under this Agreement and the third party
will assume Vendor Parent's obligations under this Agreement for the remainder
of the Restricted Period.

  

  

    

5.

  |  

Enforcement

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The Vendor and Vendor Parent specifically acknowledge that the Purchaser and
Purchaser Parent, in agreeing to purchase the Company, have relied on each of
the Vendor's and Vendor Parent's covenants of non-competition as set forth in
this Agreement and that this Agreement is an integral part of the transaction
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement under which the Vendor and Vendor
Parent have received significant benefit. The Vendor and Vendor Parent,
therefore, specifically acknowledge and agree that breach of the terms of this
Agreement by the Vendor or Vendor Parent or any Affiliate thereof, would cause
the Purchaser and Purchaser Parent irreparable harm not compensable in
damages. The Vendor and Vendor Parent further acknowledge and agree that it is
essential to the effective enforcement of this Agreement that the Purchaser
and Purchaser Parent be entitled to the remedy of an injunction without being
required to show irreparable harm. Having regard to the importance of the
goodwill of the Company purchased under the Purchase Agreement, the purchase
price for such goodwill and all of the circumstances of the transaction
referred to in the Purchase Agreement, the Vendor and Vendor Parent
acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement are just and reasonable
having regard to all the circumstances. The Vendor and Vendor Parent
acknowledge that they have received independent legal advice from Torys LLP
prior to executing this Agreement.

  

    

6.

  |  

Severability

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Agreement or its application to
any party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or unenforceable, such
provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of
such restriction, prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement and without affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or without
affecting its application to other parties or circumstances.
