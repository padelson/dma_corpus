 This Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of May 22, 2001, by and among: Inhale Therapeutic Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); Square Acquisition Corp., an Alabama corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); Shearwater Corporation, an Alabama corporation (the "Company"); J.

Certain other capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A. 

  

Recitals

  

 A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of the Company into Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement and the Alabama Business Corporation Act (the "Merger"). Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will cease to exist. 

  

 B. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). For accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger be treated as a purchase. 

   

 C. The Merger and this Agreement each have been approved by the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. 

  

 D. The Designated Shareholders own a total of 829,961 shares of the Common Stock (par value $.01 per share) of the Company ("Company Common Stock"). Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Signing Shareholders are executing and delivering to Parent a Shareholder Agreement of even date herewith. 

  

Agreement

  

 The parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

  

SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

  

 1.1 Merger of the Company into Merger Sub; Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, and the separate existence of the Company shall cease. Merger Sub will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as consideration for the Merger, the Parent shall issue to the shareholders of the Company and holders of Company Options (as defined below) an aggregate of (a) 4,000,000 shares (including shares issuable pursuant to Company Options assumed by Parent as set forth in Section 1.6) of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration") and (b) $72,500,000 in cash (the "Cash Consideration" and collectively the "Merger Consideration"). 

  

 1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Alabama Business Corporation Act. 

  

 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward llp, Five Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto, California 94306 at 10:00 a.m. at such time and date during the period from the date hereof through July 31, 2001, unless extended by the parties hereto, as Parent and Company may 

    mutually agree, which date shall be no later than the third business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 6
and 7 (the "Scheduled Closing Time"). The date on which the Closing actually
takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."
Contemporaneously with the Closing, properly executed articles of merger
conforming to the requirements of the Alabama Business Corporation Act shall
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Alabama to effect the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time such articles of merger
are filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Alabama (the "Effective
Time").

  

 1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall conform to the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; 

  

 (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

 (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the individuals identified on Exhibit B. 

  

 1.5 Conversion of Shares. 

  

 (a) Subject to Sections 1.8 and 1.9, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive: (i) the "Applicable Number" (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(i)) of shares of the common stock of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the "Applicable Cash Payment" (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(ii)). 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

  

 (i) The "Applicable Number" shall be the quotient (which number shall not be rounded) obtained by dividing (A) 4,000,000 by (B) the Adjusted Fully Diluted Company Share Amount (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(iii)). 

   

 (ii) The "Applicable Cash Payment" shall be the quotient (which number shall not be rounded) obtained by dividing (A) the Cash Consideration by (B) the Adjusted Fully Diluted Company Share Amount. 

  

 (iii) The "Adjusted Fully Diluted Company Share Amount" shall be the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to all Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all shares of Company Common Stock that may ultimately be purchased under Company Options that are unvested or are otherwise not then exercisable). 

  

  

 (c) Except with respect to (i) the Company\'s Founding Shareholders Buy Sell Agreement, as amended, and the 1996 Stock Option Plan Shareholders\' Buy Sell Agreement, as amended, each of which shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, (ii) Company Options which accelerate as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the repurchase rights provided in the Company\'s 1996 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, which rights shall be waived, or eliminated from the provisions of such plan through an amendment to such plan or other effective action of the Company, if any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock and Applicable Cash Payment issued in exchange for such shares of Company 

    Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition. The certificates representing
such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends, and such certificates and the Applicable Cash Payment issued in
exchange for such shares, may, at the option of Parent, be held in escrow by
Parent until the repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
shall have lapsed.

  

 (d) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Applicable Number of shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 1.6 Employee Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each stock option that is then outstanding under the Company\'s 1996 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, whether vested or unvested (a "Company Option"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company\'s 1996 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan and the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced. The term "Company Option" shall not include any options described on Part 1.6 of the Disclosure Schedule. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with respect to Parent Common Stock (subject to applicable withholding) in accordance with subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 1.6. From and after the Effective Time, (a) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (b) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable Number, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (c) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Applicable Number, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; (d) except as set forth in subsection (e) below or as may result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, all restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall continue in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability, and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; and (e) the Company\'s 1996 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan shall be amended, the applicable provisions waived or such other necessary action of the Company taken, to (i) clarify the rights of Parent, including under Section 5.3 of such Plan, to assume the Company\'s Options in accordance with this Agreement and upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions; (ii) eliminate the Company\'s repurchase rights with respect to the Company\'s Options set forth in Section 6.9 of such Plan and the Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Options under Article VII of such Plan; (iii) provide for a 90-day period after termination of employment, engagement and directorship, as the case may be, to exercise the Company Options; (iv) eliminate the provisions of Section 9.2 of such Plan (to the extent the ongoing effect of such provision would have an adverse effect on the holders of Company Options); and (v) make other conforming amendments as agreed upon by the Parent and the Company; _provided, however,_ that, except for the Company Options listed on Part 1.6 of the Disclosure Schedule, all such Company Options shall immediately vest and become exercisable at the Effective Time; and _provided, further, however,_ that each such assumed Company Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction effected by Parent after the Effective Time. In addition, as of the Effective Time, each holder of an assumed Company Option shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the Applicable Cash Payment and the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Option Cash Payment"), subject to applicable 

    withholding. The Company and Parent shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Company\'s 1996 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan and
otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6. Following the
Closing, Parent will send or deliver to each holder of an assumed Company
Option (A) a written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Option, and (ii) the
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Company Option, and (B) the applicable Company Option Cash Payment.
Parent shall file with the SEC, not later than the earlier of (y) forty-five
(45) days following the Closing Date, or (z) five (5) days following the
filing of any current report on Form 8-K required to be filed by Parent after
the Closing with respect to the transactions contemplated herein
(which report shall include all financial statements required to be included
in such report), a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
appropriate form) registering the exercise of the Company Options assumed by
Parent pursuant to this Section 1.6 and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, including the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein, for so long as such Company
Options remain outstanding.

  

 1.7 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of the Company\'s capital stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company\'s capital stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of such shares of the Company\'s capital stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8. 

  

 1.8 Exchange of Certificates; Escrow Consideration. 

  

 (a) On or before the Effective Time, Parent will deposit that portion of the Cash Consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock with the Escrow Agent who shall have received instructions with respect to distribution in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (as defined below). Within five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, Parent will send to the holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for (A) certificates representing Parent Common Stock and (B) the appropriate cash payment. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Escrow Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Escrow Agent or the Company\'s Transfer Agent, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor: (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 after giving effect to the Escrowed Shares (as defined below); (ii) a cash payment, made by the Escrow Agent to the record owner of such Company Stock Certificate, in an amount equal to the cash payment such holder has a right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 after giving effect to the Escrowed Cash (as defined below); and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. The parties have determined to establish an escrow of a portion of the Merger Consideration having a value as of the Effective Time of $12,000,000.00 (the "Escrow Consideration") and which is comprised of (i) that portion of the Cash Consideration having a value equal to the product of (A) the Escrow Consideration and the (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the aggregate Cash Consideration by the value of the Merger Consideration on the date prior to the Closing Date (valuing the Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stock Price (the "Escrowed Cash") and (ii) that portion of the Stock Consideration having a value equal to the product of (A) the Escrow Consideration and the (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the aggregate Stock Consideration on the date prior to the Closing Date (valuing the Parent Common 

    Stock at the Parent Stock Price) by the value of the Merger Consideration on
the date prior to the Closing Date (valuing the Parent Common Stock at the
Parent Stock Price) (the "Escrowed Shares"). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, on behalf and in the
name of each Company shareholder, a certificate representing the Escrowed
Shares. The Escrow Consideration shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the
terms of the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto
(as such form may be reasonably amended at the request of the Escrow Agent)
for the purposes of funding any indemnification obligations that may arise
under or be incurred by the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Section 9
hereof. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender: (i) a certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by this Section 1; and (ii) a
cash payment as contemplated by this Section 1\. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of: (i) any
certificate representing Parent Common Stock; or (ii) any cash payment,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as
Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate.

  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment due pursuant to Section 1.5 or in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends and distributions and such cash payment). 

  

 (c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of capital stock of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the Parent Stock Price. 

  

 (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company or Company Option pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company or Company Option for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 1.9 Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective Time, are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly notifies the Company of such Person\'s intent to demand payment of the fair value of the shares held by such Person pursuant to, and who has complied in all respects with Article 13 of the 

    Alabama Business Corporation Act to the extent such compliance is required
prior to the Effective Time ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive: (i) Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 1.5, or (ii) any cash payment in accordance with Section 1.5 (or cash
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(c)), and the
holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may
be granted to such holder or holders in Article 13 of the Alabama
Business Corporation Act; _provided, however,_ that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Business Corporations Act, then the
rights of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting
Shares shall cease, and such Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
converted into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares) (i)
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5, and (ii) the appropriate
cash payment in accordance with Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with Section 1.8(c)).

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to pay fair value of any shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Business Corporation Act and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Alabama Business Corporation Act, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer. 

  

 1.10 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 

  

 1.11 Accounting Treatment. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be treated as a purchase. 

  

 1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

breaches of representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.14, shall be
solely from and out of the Escrow Consideration) each of the Indemnitees for,
(i) any Damages which are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any
of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may otherwise become
subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party
claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly
connected with: (A) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 2 or the Closing Certificate (without giving
effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualification or
any similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in
such representation or warranty, but with giving effect to any update to the
Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the Closing)
to the extent such representation and warranty has not expired pursuant to
Section 9.1 above; and (B) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the
Company (including the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 5); (ii) any
Legal Proceeding relating to any inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to
in clause "(A)", or "(B)" above (including any Legal Proceeding commenced by

warranties or breach of any covenant or obligation shall have been provided,
(ii) with respect to intentional fraud; and (iii) with respect to breaches of
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.14 herein.

  

 (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that, if the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach. 

  

 (c) The Indemnitors shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or (ii) until such time as the total amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising from any inaccuracies in or breaches of any representations or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate (the "Damages Threshold"); provided, however, if the total amount of such Damages exceeds the Damages Threshold, then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for any and all Damages regardless of the Damages Threshold. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the maximum liability of each Indemnitor to the Indemnitees for Damages relating to any breach by the Company or Designated Shareholders of any representation or warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to and, except in the event of intentional fraud or breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.14, payable solely out of the Escrow Consideration held in the name of such Indemnitor pursuant to Section 1.8; _provided, however,_ that the limitation with respect to the amount of liability to which any Indemnitor may become subject that are set forth in this Section 9.2(d) shall not apply in the case of intentional fraud. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the indemnity provided in this Section 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees for Damages relating to any breach by the Company or Designated Shareholders of any representation or warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the limitations set forth in this Section 9.2(e) shall not apply in the case of intentional fraud. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 9 which arises out of facts and circumstances 

    specifically disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule, any update to the
Disclosure Schedule delivered prior to Closing or the Company Closing
Certificate and not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 9 for
any Tax liability incurred by Company arising from: (i) any merger,
liquidation, business combination or other structural change to the Company
made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub on or after the Closing Date,
(ii) any Tax election(s) made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub immediately before, on or after the Closing Date, or (iii) any Taxes
incurred by the operation of the Company\'s business by Parent or Merger Sub
after the Closing Date.

  

 (g) The parties each agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages which are subject to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 9.3 No Contribution. Each Indemnitor waives, and acknowledges and agrees that he shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or the Closing Certificate. 

  

 9.4 Interest. Any Indemnitor who is required to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9 with respect to any Damages shall also be liable to such Indemnitee for interest on the amount of such Damages (for the period commencing as of the date on which such Indemnitor first received notice of a claim for recovery by such Indemnitee and ending on the date on which the liability of such Indemnitor to such Indemnitee is fully satisfied by such Indemnitor) at a floating rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank of America, N.T. and S.A. from time to time as its prime, base or reference rate. 

  

 9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against Merger Sub, the Company, Parent or against any other Person) with respect to which any Indemnitor may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Shareholders\' Agent; _provided, however,_ that the Shareholders\' Agent may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding: 

  

 (a) all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitors; 

  

 (b) each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents and materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and 

  

 (c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Shareholders\' Agent (as defined in Section 10.1); provided, however, that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 Parent shall give the Shareholders\' Agent prompt notice of the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Surviving Corporation and shall keep the Shareholders\' Agent informed at all stages thereof; provided, however, that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify or inform the Shareholders\' Agent shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors under this Section 9 (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). 

  

 9.6 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign 

    thereof) shall have consented in writing to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.
