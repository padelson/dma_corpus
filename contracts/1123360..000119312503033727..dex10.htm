(g) For purposes of calculating the Acquisition Cost, the following
procedures shall apply: 



(i) Not less than two (2) business days before the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Parent a statement (the " _Initial
Cash Statement_ ") showing the amount of Cash on Hand at the end of business
on the fifth business day before the Closing Date (the "Cash Measurement
Date") stating the Cash on Hand as of the Cash Measurement Date _minus_ (i)
$5.5 million of cash, (ii) an additional initial amount of $550,000 of cash
(with regard to (i) and (ii), in each case excluding cash equivalents but
including foreign currencies, which foreign currencies shall be measured in
dollars and calculated using exchange rates as set forth by Banco de Mexico on
the Diario Oficial de la Federacion two business days before the Closing
Date), and (iii) an amount equal to the Accrued Taxes (the result of such
calculation, the " _Initial Cash on Hand_ ") and any work papers and other
documents and information used by the Company in preparing the Initial
Cash Statement. Unless the Company, the Parent and the Shareholder
Representative object, each in their sole discretion, the Initial Cash on Hand
set forth in the Initial Cash Statement will be used to calculate the Cash on
Hand and the Acquisition Cost, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section
4.3(v) below.



 

18 (ii) Not more than five (5) business days after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Entity shall prepare and deliver to the Parent and the Shareholder
Representative a statement of cash balance (the " _Closing Cash Statement_ ")
showing the amount of Cash on Hand at the end of business on the Closing Date
_minus_ (i) $5.5 million of cash (excluding cash equivalents but including
foreign currencies, which foreign currencies shall be measured in dollars and
calculated using exchange rates as set forth by Banco de Mexico on the Diario
Oficial de la Federacion two business days before the Closing Date), and (ii)
an amount equal to the Accrued Taxes (the result of such calculation, the "
_Closing Cash on Hand_ ") and any work papers and other documents and
information used by the Surviving Entity in preparing the Closing Cash
Statement.



(iii) If, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Cash
Statement, the Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case may be,
has not given the Shareholder Representative or the Parent, as the case may
be, written notice of its objection as to the calculation of the Closing Cash
on Hand (which notice shall state the basis of its objection), then such
calculation of Closing Cash on Hand shall be binding and conclusive on the
parties to this Agreement, including without limitation for purposes of the
adjustment procedure set forth in Section 4.3(v) below.



(iv) If the Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case may be,
duly gives the Shareholder Representative or the Parent, as the case may be,
such notice of objection, and if the Shareholder Representative and the Parent
fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the Closing Cash
Statement within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Shareholder
Representative or the Parent, as the case may be, of the objection notice by
the Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, the
Shareholder Representative and the Parent shall submit the issues remaining in
dispute to KPMG LLP or such other nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants as the parties to this Agreement mutually agree (the "
_Independent Accountants_ "). If issues are submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution, (i) the Shareholder Representative and the Parent
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent Accountants such

discuss the issues with the Independent Accountants; (ii) the Independent
Accountants shall calculate Cash on Hand at the close of business on the
Closing Date, and the determination by the Independent Accountants, as set
forth in a notice to be delivered to both the Shareholder Representative and
the Parent within sixty (60) days of the submission to the Independent
Accountants of the issues remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties hereto and shall constitute the Closing Cash on
Hand; and (iii) any fees and costs of the Independent Accountants for such
determination shall be split equally between the Parent and the Indemnity
Fund.



(v) The " _Adjustment Amount_ " (which may be a positive or negative
number) will be equal to the amount determined by subtracting Closing Cash on
Hand (determined in accordance with Section 4.3(iii) or (iv) above, whichever
is applicable) from the Initial Cash on Hand as set forth in the Initial Cash
Statement. Within five (5) days of



 

19 the determination of the Closing Cash on Hand pursuant to Section 4.3 (iii) or
(iv) above, as the case may be: (a) if the Adjustment Amount is positive, the
Escrow Agent shall pay the Adjustment Amount to the Parent from the Indemnity
Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the Parent, and such payment shall be treated as a reduction of the LAMS
Shareholder Consideration and the DolEx Class B Purchase Price or (b) if the
Adjustment Amount is negative, the Parent shall pay the Adjustment Amount
(multiplied by the LAMS Percentage and the DolEx Class B Percentage,
respectively) to the Shareholders and to the DolEx Class B Shareholders, as
additional LAMS Shareholder Consideration and DolEx Class B Purchase Price, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the Shareholder Representative.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_



10.1. _Tax Matters_.



(a) _Tax Indemnification_. The Shareholders and the DolEx Class B
Shareholders shall severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Parent
Group Member from and against any Liability, as well as Losses or Expenses
arising therefrom, for (i) any unpaid Taxes of the Company and each Subsidiary
with respect to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) any
unpaid Taxes of the Company and each Subsidiary with respect to any Tax period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ")
to the extent allocable (as determined in Section 10.1(b)) to the portion of
such period ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_ ") and (iii) any breach in this Agreement of any covenant,
representation or warranty relating to Taxes.



For purposes of Section 10.1(a), unpaid Tax for the period from January
1, 2003 through the Closing Date shall be the Tax with respect to such period
less the amount of estimated Taxes paid by the Company prior to the Closing
Date with respect to such period and less the Accrued Taxes for such period,
reflected on a certificate duly executed by the President or Chairman of the
Company pursuant to Section 4.6(h). Parent shall refund to the Shareholders
and to Pilscomb Properties LLC, on behalf of the DolEx Class B Shareholders,
their proportionate amount by which the estimated Taxes paid by the Company
with respect to such period and the Accrued Taxes for such period, reflected
on an executed certificate pursuant to Section 4.6(h), exceed the amount of
Taxes owed to the relevant Governmental Body with respect to such period.



Each Parent Group Member shall severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Shareholder Group Member and the DolEx Class B Shareholders from and
against any Liability, as well as Losses or Expenses arising therefrom, for
(i) the Taxable periods that begin after the Closing Date, (ii) the portion
of any Tax attributable to the Straddle Period to the extent allocable to the
period commencing after the Closing Date as set forth in Section 10.1(b), and
(iii) any Tax periods that end on or before the Closing Date including the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date only if
such Liability is attributable to any election made by the Parent Group,
Company or Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to any election under
Section 338 of the Code) after the Closing Date.



If Parent intends to file an amended Tax Return for Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date and if
this filing would create a Tax Indemnification obligation for Shareholders and
the DolEx Class B Shareholders pursuant to Section 10.1(a), Parent shall
submit to the Shareholder Representative copies of the portion of such amended
Tax Return that would create such Tax Indemnification obligation for its
review and comments at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such amended
Tax Return is intended to be filed, the date of which will be disclosed to the
Shareholder Representative. Parent shall consider such comments in good faith.
Nonetheless, if Parent does not agree with or accept any of the
written comments provided by the Shareholder Representative or if



 

60 Shareholder Representative does not deliver its written comments to Parent
within 15 days of Shareholder Representatives receipt of the amended Tax
Return, the Parent may still file such amended Tax Return as originally
submitted to the Shareholder Representative.



(b) _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. For purposes of Section 10.1(a), in
the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable
for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than income taxes
and Taxes measured by capital, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Tax period and (ii) in the case of any
income taxes or any Tax based on or measured by capital, be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date.



(c) _Taxes of Other Persons_. The Shareholders and the DolEx Class B
Shareholders shall severally indemnify each Parent Group Member from and
against the entirety of any and all Tax liability, as well as Losses or
Expenses arising therefrom, imposed on the Company, the Subsidiaries, or a
Parent Group Member, to the extent allocable to a Tax Period ending on or
before the Closing Date or during the Pre-Closing Tax Period and which is
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
any Losses or Expenses of any Person other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries (i) as a transferee or successor, (ii) by contract, (iii) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of foreign,
state or local law) or (iv) otherwise.



(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax Sharing Agreements or similar
agreements (other than this Agreement) with respect to or involving the
Company or any Subsidiary shall be terminated as of or before the Closing Date
and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be
bound thereby or have any Losses or Expenses thereunder for any taxable year
(whether the current year, a future year or a past year) or have any
obligation (including Tax obligations) to make any payment thereby to any
party after the Closing Date.



10.2. _Tax Return Filing, Etc_. __



(a) _Tax Periods Ending on or before December 31, 2002, But Filed After
the Date Hereof_. The Company, or with respect to those Tax Returns filed

cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for
the Company and each Subsidiary for periods ending on or prior to December 31,
2002, but which are filed after the date hereof. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with prior practice,
except as required by a change in applicable Tax law. The Company or the
Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, shall submit to Parent copies
of such Tax Returns for its approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed. If Parent does not
give its approval in a timely manner, the Company or the Shareholder
Representative, as the case may be, can file or arrange to file such Tax
Returns.



 

61 (b) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date, But Filed
After Closing Date_. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall

consistent with prior practice, except as required by a change in applicable
Tax law. Parent shall submit to the Shareholder Representative copies of such
Tax Returns for its approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date
such Tax Return is required to be filed. If the Shareholder Representative
does not give its approval in a timely manner, Parent can file or arrange to
file such Tax Returns. Parent shall be responsible for the timely payment of
all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, subject, however, to the
obligation of the Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders to indemnify
the Parent Group Member to the extent required under Section 10.1, pursuant to
the provisions of Sections 10.9(d)(iii) and 10.9(e)(iii) below.



(c) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.
Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary for any Straddle
Period. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past
practice, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable Tax law.
Parent shall submit to the Shareholder Representative copies of such Tax
Returns for its approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Tax
Return is required to be filed. If Shareholder Representative does not give
its approval in a timely manner, Parent can file or arrange to file such Tax
Returns. Parent shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns, subject, however, to the obligation of the
Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders to indemnify Parent to the
extent required under Section 10.1, pursuant to the provisions of Sections
10.9(d)(iii) and 10.9(e)(iii) below.



(d) _Contests_. If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding,
suit, dispute or other claim (a " _Tax Contest_ ") shall be delivered, sent,
commenced, or initiated to, by or against a Parent Group Member, the Company
or any Subsidiary by any taxing authority with respect to Taxes that results
in or may result in Tax Losses or Expenses for which indemnification may be
claimed against Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders under this
Agreement, Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholder Representative in
writing of such Tax Contest; _provided_ that the failure to so notify the
Shareholder Representative shall not relieve Shareholders or the DolEx Class B
Shareholders of their indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that such failure prejudices the Shareholders or the DolEx Class B
Shareholders defense of the Tax Contest. The Shareholders and the DolEx Class
B Shareholders shall have the right to represent the Company and each
Subsidiarys interests and to employ counsel of their choice at their expense
with respect to any such Tax Contest for which they are entirely liable;
provided that the Shareholder Representative shall immediately notify Parent
of the decision to take control of such Tax Contest; and Parent shall cause
the Company and each Subsidiary to execute any powers of attorney or other
documents or forms necessary in order to allow the Shareholders and the DolEx
Class B Shareholders to control such Tax Contest and to settle any such Tax
Contest. In the case of any such Tax Contest, Parent shall also be entitled
to participate at its own expense in such Tax Contest. In the case of any Tax
Contest relating to any Tax for any Straddle Period, or with respect to any
Tax Contest in which the Shareholders



 

62 or the DolEx Class B Shareholders do not have the right to represent the
Company or a Subsidiarys interest pursuant to this Section 10.2(d), Parent,
the Shareholders, and the DolEx Class B Shareholders shall each be entitled to
participate at their own expense in such Tax Contest to the extent it relates
to a Tax for which such party bears Losses or Expenses pursuant to Section
10.1. No party may settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax Contest in any
manner without the consent and approval of the other party, which consent and
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In
the event that Shareholders or the DolEx Class B Shareholders do not take
control of a Tax Contest that they have the right to control hereunder, Parent
shall keep the Shareholder Representative reasonably informed as to the
progress of such Tax Contest and shall not enter into any settlement or other
disposition of such Tax Contest prior to receiving the written consent of the
Shareholder Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In no event, without the prior written consent of the
Shareholder Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, shall Parent, the Company or each Subsidiary grant an
extension of any applicable statute of limitations in respect of any Tax
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period.



(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Company, each Subsidiary of
the Company, IFMX, and CISA shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 10.2 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
(with supporting details) which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Return
filing, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, Company, each
Subsidiary of the Company, IFMX, and CISA agree (A) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and each
Subsidiary relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Parent or any of the Shareholders or the DolEx Class B
Shareholders any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records. Notwithstanding any of the above, in connection with
the filing of the Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary pursuant to
Section 10.2(b) and Section 10.2(c), IFMX and CISA each agree to provide the
information necessary to file such Tax Returns at least four months prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Returns.



(f) _Further Assistance_. Parent, the Shareholders, and the DolEx Class B
Shareholders further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby). Parent, the Shareholders, and the DolEx Class B
Shareholders further agree, upon request, to provide the other party with all
information that either party may be required to report pursuant to Section
6043 of the Code (or any similar provisions of any applicable tax law).



 

63 10.3. _Distribution or Sale of CISA and IFMX_. Any Taxes and
Losses arising therefrom resulting from the transfer of all of the Companys
stock ownership interest in CISA and IFMX to the Shareholders prior to the
Closing Date or, alternatively, any Taxes, Losses, and Expenses arising
therefrom resulting from the sale of all of the Companys stock ownership
interest in CISA and IFMX and the distribution of the sale proceeds to the
Shareholders prior to the Closing Date will each be Taxes treated as Pre-
Closing Taxes pursuant to Section 10.1 for which Shareholders have an
obligation to reimburse the Parent at such time as the applicable Tax Return
is filed with the appropriate taxing authority, pursuant to the procedure set
forth in Section 10.2. In connection with the transfer of all of the
Companys stock ownership interests in CISA and IFMX to the Shareholders, for
purpose of calculating gain on the distribution of IFMX and CISA, the fair
market value of the stock interest of IFMX and CISA shall be the amount
specified in an appraisal prepared by CIBZ Valuation, Inc., an independent
third party appraiser mutually acceptable to Parent and Shareholders. In
connection with the sale of all of the Companys stock ownership interest in
CISA and IFMX to an unrelated third party, for purpose of calculating gain,
the amount of the respective sale proceeds received by Company shall be deemed
to be at fair market value. In connection with the sale of all of the
Companys stock ownership interest in CISA and IFMX to a third party that is
a related party, for purpose of calculating gain, the fair market value of the
stock interests of CISA and IFMX shall be the amount specified in an appraisal
prepared by CIBZ Valuation, Inc. The adjusted tax basis of the stock interest
of IFMX for both of the above transaction alternatives shall be calculated by
KPMG LLP. The adjusted tax basis of the stock interest of CISA for both of the
above transaction alternatives shall be calculated by KPMG LLP and shall
be determined for U.S. tax purposes as well as Mexican tax purposes. All such
appraisals and adjusted tax bases calculations shall be promptly provided to
the Parent upon completion.



10.4. _Deconsolidation_. The Shareholders shall be liable for all Taxes
and Losses of the Company and each Subsidiary attributable to deconsolidating
adjustments (including without limitation any deferred income triggered into
income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss accounts
taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19) for all
periods through the Closing Date, including adjustments caused by the
distribution by the Company of the stock of IFMX and CISA prior to the Closing
Date.



10.5. _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use and other transfer taxes
(including all share transfer taxes, if any) incurred in connection with this
Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by the party to whom such
transfer taxes are assessed under applicable law.



10.6. _Indemnification of Parent Group Members for CISA and IFMX_. The
Shareholders shall severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Parent
Group Member from and against any Losses or Expenses incurred by such Parent
Group Member associated with or arising from the business or operations of
CISA and IFMX.



10.7. _Indemnification of Parent Group Members_.



The Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders shall severally indemnify
and hold harmless each Parent Group Member from and against any and
all Losses and Expenses incurred by such Parent Group Member as a direct
result of:



 

64 (i) any breach by the Company or any Subsidiary of any covenant in this
Agreement;



(ii) any breach, or (in the case of any third-party claim) alleged breach,
of any warranty or the inaccuracy, or (in the case of any third-party claim)
alleged inaccuracy, of any representation of the Company or any Subsidiary
contained in this Agreement;



(iii) any Liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary associated with or
arising from the conduct of the business or operations of the Company or such
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time, except for those Liabilities (x)
accrued or reserved against in the Audited Financial Statements or the
Quarterly Financial Statements, (y) set forth on the Schedules to this
Agreement, or (z) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since March 31, 2003; or



(iv) notwithstanding the exception contained in the immediately preceding
Section 10.7(iii)(y), any Losses associated those matters set forth on
_Schedule 5.16_.



10.8. _Indemnification of Shareholder Group Members_.



(a) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall jointly and severally indemnify
and hold harmless each Shareholder Group Member from and against any and all
Loss and Expense incurred by such Shareholder Group Member as a direct result
of:



(i) any breach, by Parent or the Surviving Entity of any of their
respective covenants in this Agreement; or



(ii) any breach, or (in the case of any third-party claim) alleged material
breach, of any warranty or the inaccuracy, or (in the case of any third-party
claim) alleged inaccuracy, of any representation of Parent or the Surviving
Entity contained in this Agreement.



(b) The indemnification provided for in this Section 10.8 shall terminate
three years after the Effective Date (and no claims shall be made by any
Shareholder Group Member under this Section 10.8 thereafter), except that the
indemnification obligation of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall continue
as to any Loss or Expense of which any Shareholder Group Member has notified
Parent and the Surviving Entity in accordance with the requirements of
Section 10.10 or prior to the date such indemnification obligation would
otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 10.8, as to which the
indemnification obligation of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall continue
until the Loss or Expense of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall have been
determined pursuant to this _Article X_ , and Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall have reimbursed all Shareholder Group Members for the full amount of
such Loss and Expense for which Parent and the Surviving Entity are
responsible in accordance with this _Article X_.



 

65 10.9. _Obligations for Indemnification of Parent Group Members_.



(a) Except for the indemnification obligations described in Section
10.9(d), any obligations arising pursuant to Section 4.3(g) or under the
indemnification provided to the Parent Group Members under this _Article X_
shall be satisfied solely from an indemnity fund comprised of (y) the Escrow
Amount  LAMS Cash Portion, the LAMS Escrow Note (or the proceeds thereof,
once paid), the Escrow Amount  DolEx Class B Cash Portion, and the DolEx
Class B Escrow Note (or the proceeds thereof, once paid), and (z) any amounts
subsequently contributed pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Earnout Agreement,
which shall collectively be referred to as the " _Indemnity Fund_ " and which
shall have an aggregate balance as of the Closing Date of $38 million (not
including those additional amounts to be contributed pursuant to Section 3.3
of the Earnout Agreement).



(b) The Indemnity Fund shall be reduced or terminate for each party thereto
according to _Schedule A_ ; it being noted that for the Advent Shareholders
(as identified on _Schedule A_ ) any remaining amounts held in the Indemnity
Fund shall be released and distributed eighteen months from the Closing Date
(with regard to 50% of the original amount of the Indemnity Fund attributable
to the Advent Shareholders, net of claims), thirty months from the Closing
Date (with regard to 25% of the original amount of the Indemnity Fund
attributable to the Advent Shareholders, net of claims) and the earlier of
thirty-six months from the Closing Date or December 31, 2006 (with regard to
25% of the original amount of the Indemnity Fund attributable to the Advent
Shareholders, net of claims), all as set forth in detail on _Schedule A_. No
claims shall be made by any Parent Group Member against the Indemnity Fund
after such termination, except that payment obligations from the Indemnity
Fund shall continue as to any Loss or Expense of which any Parent Group Member
has notified the Shareholder Representative in accordance with the
requirements of this _Article X_ on or prior to the date the Indemnity Fund
would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 10.9(b), as to which
the indemnification obligation shall continue until the indemnification Loss
or Expense shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article X_ , and the
Parent Group Members shall have been indemnified for the full amount of such
Loss and Expense in accordance with and subject to the limitations of this
_Article X_.



(c) The Indemnity Fund shall not be available under this _Article X_ for
(i) any Losses or Expenses of Parent Group Members unless the aggregate of all
Losses and Expenses for which the Indemnity Fund would be available but for
this Section 10.9(c) exceeds One-Hundred-Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "
_Aggregate Basket Amount_ "), and (ii) any particular Loss or associated
Expense for which the Indemnity Fund would be available but for this Section
10.9(c) unless such Loss and associated Expenses exceeds $10,000 (the "
_Claim Threshold_ "). When the aggregate amount of all Losses and Expenses for
which the Indemnity Fund is available exceeds the Aggregate Basket Amount,
Parent may recover for all such Losses or Expenses. For purposes of
calculating the Claim Threshold, all Losses or Expenses arising from events
involving the same or substantially similar facts or circumstances shall be
aggregated. The Claim Threshold shall not apply to claims arising or relating
to any indemnification obligation arising as a result of a breach of the
representations, warranties, or covenants contained in Sections 5.13(d), (e)
and 7.10. __



 

66 (d) Claims made by any Parent Group Member for Losses and Expenses
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the following matters shall not be limited solely to payment from the
Indemnity Fund, but shall instead be subject to the following limitations:



(i) with respect to the Shareholders only, any claim made regarding CISA
or IFMX, or the sale, transfer, or distribution of the Companys ownership of
CISA or IFMX, may be made by a Parent Group Member on or before December 31,
2006, and any payments made by any Shareholder relating thereto shall be
limited to such Shareholders pro-rata portion of the Base Amount _plus_ such
Shareholders pro-rata portion of any amount deposited into the Indemnity Fund
pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Earnout Agreement,  _less_ all amounts paid to
a Parent Group Member by such Shareholder or from such Shareholders
Individual Escrow Account pursuant to this _Article X_ ;



(ii) any claim made regarding fraud or the organization and capitalization
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, may be made by a Parent Group
Member on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date and any payments
made by any Shareholder or DolEx Class B Shareholder relating thereto shall
be limited to such Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders pro-rata
portion of the Base Amount _plus_ such Shareholders or DolEx Class B
Shareholders pro-rata portion of any amount deposited into the Indemnity
Fund pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Earnout Agreement, _less_ all amounts paid
to a Parent Group Member by such Shareholder or DolEx Class B Shareholder or
from such Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders Individual Escrow
Account pursuant to this _Article X_ ; and



(iii) any claims made regarding the Tax obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.6 and the covenants contained in _Article VII_ and Sections 10.1
through 10.5, but excluding any and all such claims relating to CISA or IFMX,
or the sale, transfer or distribution of the Companys ownership thereof
which shall be covered by Section 10.9(d)(i) above, may be made by a Parent
Group Member on or before the earlier of December 31, 2006, or the applicable
statute of limitations for such Tax obligations and any payments made by any
Shareholder or DolEx Class B Shareholder relating thereto shall be limited to
such Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders pro-rata portion of an
amount equal to $38 million _plus_ such Shareholders or DolEx Class B
Shareholders pro-rata portion of any amount deposited into the Indemnity Fund
pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Earnout Agreement, _less_ all amounts paid to a
Parent Group Member from such Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders
Individual Escrow Account pursuant to this _Article X_ or directly from such
Shareholder or DolEx Class B Shareholder pursuant to Sections 10.9(e)(iii)(y)
and (z).



(e) The obligations of the Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders
under Section 10.9(d) shall be satisfied as follows:



(i) With respect to all obligations arising under the indemnification
provided to the Parent Group Members under Section 10.9(d)(i), Parent may
elect, in its sole



 

67 discretion, to seek indemnification from (i) that portion of the Indemnity
Fund allocable to the Shareholders, or (ii) the Shareholders in accordance
with the limitations set forth in Section 10.9(d)(i).



(ii) With respect to all obligations arising under the indemnification
provided to the Parent Group Members under Section 10.9(d)(ii), Parent may
elect, in its sole discretion, to seek indemnification from (i) the Indemnity
Fund, or (ii) the Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders in
accordance with the limitations set forth in Section 10.9(d)(ii). 



(iii) With respect to all obligations arising under the indemnification
provided to the Parent Group Members under Section 10.9(d)(iii), and in
accordance with the limitations contained therein:



(x) For the first eighteen months following the Closing Date, Parent may
only pursue payment for the claim from the Indemnity Fund;



(y) For the period beginning on the first day of the nineteenth month
following the Closing Date through the thirtieth month following the Closing
Date, Parent may elect to pursue payment for the claim from the Indemnity
Fund or the Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders, _provided_ that
if such claim is equal to or less than 5% of the remaining undistributed
balance of the Indemnity Fund, Parent may only pursue payment for the claim
from the Indemnity Fund; and



(z) For the period beginning on the first day of the thirty-first month
following the Closing Date through December 31, 2006, Parent may only pursue
payment for the claim from the Shareholders and the DolEx Class
B Shareholders.



(iv) If Parent makes an election in any Claim Notice to pursue
indemnification from the Shareholders and DolEx Class B Shareholders, and
certain Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders do not satisfy their
payment obligations, Parent shall have the right to pursue payment of the
obligation from the Indemnity Fund by notice to the Escrow Agent and the
Shareholder Representative. Such Claim Notice shall indicate the exact name of
those Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders, as applicable,
whose Individual Escrow Accounts (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) shall
be debited for payment of the obligation, and the exact amount for each
account. In no instance shall Parent be allowed to pursue payment pursuant to
this provision from the Individual Escrow Account of a Shareholder or DolEx
Class B Shareholder who has otherwise paid their pro-rata portion of such
indemnity claim.



(v) Except for claims under Section 10.9(d)(i), in the event that the
Parent elects to pursue indemnification from the Shareholders and the DolEx
Class B Shareholders for any claim, such claim must be made against each
Shareholder and DolEx Class B Shareholder, as the case may be, pro rata in
accordance with the pro rata Purchase Price received by such Shareholder or
DolEx Class B Shareholder. In the event that the Parent elects to pursue
indemnification from the Shareholders under Section 10.9(d)(i), such claim
must be made against each Shareholder in the same proportion as
such Shareholders portion of the Purchase Price received by all
Shareholders.



 

68 (vi) Except as provided in Section 10.9(e)(iv) above, in the event that
the Parent elects to pursue indemnification from the Indemnity Fund for any
claim, such claim must be made against each Shareholders or DolEx Class B
Shareholders Individual Escrow Account pro rata in accordance with the pro
rata Purchase Price received by such Shareholder or DolEx Class B
Shareholder.



(f) If, at the time any monies are to be released to the Shareholders or
the DolEx Class B Shareholders from the Indemnity Fund, any Claim Notice
making a claim against the Indemnity Fund given by a Parent Group Member or
Members remains unresolved, the Escrow Agent shall reduce the amount of such
monies to be so released by the amount of the claimed Loss and Expense of the
Parent Group Members reflected in all such unresolved Claim Notices, and
shall thereafter reimburse such Parent Group Members out of the Indemnity Fund
for the full amount of such Loss and Expense to which the Parent Group Members
are determined to be entitled in accordance with this _Article X_ up to the
amount remaining in the Indemnity Fund. If it is finally determined that the
Parent Group Members were not entitled to the full amount of the
indemnification reflected in such Claim Notices, the Escrow Agent shall
promptly thereafter release the appropriate portion of the Indemnity Fund
that had been withheld pursuant to such Claim Notices in accordance with terms
of the Escrow Agreement.



(g) All funds or other property received by the Escrow Agent shall be
retained by it as part of the Indemnity Fund. The Indemnity Fund shall be
governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. The
Indemnity Fund shall be available to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse
the Parent Group Members from and against any Loss or Expense indemnifiable
under this Article X in the manner provided in the Escrow Agreement. All fees
and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid from the Indemnity Fund.



(h) Except as may be provided under Sections 10.9(d)(i) and 10.9(d)(ii), in
no circumstances will any Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders
aggregate responsibility to indemnify the Parent Group Members pursuant to
this Agreement exceed such Shareholders or DolEx Class B Shareholders pro
rata portion of the Purchase Price received by such Shareholder or DolEx
Class B Shareholder. To the extent the consideration received by a Shareholder
or a DolEx Class B Shareholder is not in cash, any obligation to pay an
indemnity claim hereunder may discharged by assigning a
proportionate interest in the non-cash consideration received by such
Shareholder.



10.10. _Notice and Determination of Claims_.



(a) If any Parent Group Member or any Shareholder Group Member believes
that it has suffered or incurred any Loss or incurred any Expense, such
Parent Group Member or Shareholder Group Member, as the case may be (the "
_Indemnified Person_ "), shall so notify (the " _Claim Notice_ ") the
Shareholder Representative or Parent, as the case may be, promptly in writing
describing such Loss or Expense, the amount thereof, if known, and the method
of computation of such Loss or Expense, all with reasonable particularity and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect
of which such Loss or Expense shall have occurred, and shall also indicate,
if applicable, whether such claim is payable from the Indemnity Fund, and if
so from which Individual Escrow Accounts thereof (as defined in the



 

69 Escrow Agreement), or by the Parent, the Shareholders or the DolEx Class B
Shareholders. The omission by the Indemnified Person to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve any indemnification obligation under this
_Article X_ except to the extent that such omission results in a failure of
actual notice to Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case may
be, and Parent or the holders of Company Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as the case may be, are damaged as a result of such failure to
give notice. If any action at law or suit in equity is instituted by or
against a third party with respect to which any Indemnified Person intends to
claim any liability or expense as a Loss or Expense under this _Article X_ ,
such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify Parent or the Shareholder
Representative, as the case may be, of such action or suit as specified in
this Section 10.10. The Indemnified Person shall use reasonable efforts to
minimize any Loss or Expense for which indemnification is sought hereunder.



(b) Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Indemnified Person has
delivered any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the Parent or the Shareholder
Representative, as applicable, shall notify the other party in writing whether
or not the claim or the amount thereof, is disputed. If such notice states
that the claim and the amount are not disputed, or if the Parent or the
Shareholder Representative, as applicable, fails to deliver any such notice
within the required time period, the claim shall be deemed to be in compliance
with this  _Article X_ , and shall be immediately forwarded to the Escrow
Agent, the Parent, the Shareholders and/or the DolEx Class B Shareholders, as
applicable, for payment, as set forth in the Claim Notice. If a claim or the
amount thereof is disputed, the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnified Person shall be entitled under this _Article X_ shall be
determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Person, on
the one hand, and Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case may
be, on the other hand; (ii) by a final unappealable judgment or decree of any
court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Person and Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case
may be, shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final
when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have
been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.
The Indemnified Person shall have the burden of proof in establishing the
amount of Loss and Expense suffered by it.



10.11. _Third Person Claims_. In the event of any claim for
indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim,
action or legal proceeding by a third Person, the Indemnified Persons shall
give such notice thereof to Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the
case may be (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable
after such Indemnified Person has actual knowledge thereof; _provided,
however_ , that the omission by such Indemnified Person to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve any indemnification obligation under this
_Article X_ except to the extent that such omission results in a failure of
actual notice to the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Person is
damaged as a result of such failure to give notice. At any time after receipt
of such notice, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to conduct and
control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or
settlement of any such third Person claim, action or legal proceeding. In any
such case (a) the Indemnified Person shall cooperate in connection therewith
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Person in connection therewith; (b)
the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to the Indemnified Person



 

70 for any Expenses of separate counsel for the Indemnified Person subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such
Third Person claim, action or legal proceeding; and (c) the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and, at its own
expense, to employ counsel, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Person, it being understood that the Indemnifying Person will
retain control of the defense. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Person
assumes the defense of any third Person claim, action, or legal proceeding,
the Indemnified Person shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any third Person claim, action or legal
proceeding without the Indemnifying Persons written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the
defense of any such third Person claim, action or legal proceeding, the
Indemnifying Person may not settle, compromise or discharge any claim, action
or legal proceeding that seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Person without the consent of the Indemnified Person. If the
Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of any third Person
claim, action or legal proceeding, the Indemnified Person may assume
the defense of such claim through counsel of its choosing and such
Indemnifying Person shall bear all expenses of counsel for the Indemnified
Person, and may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own
expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or legal proceeding.



10.12. _After-Tax Basis; Adjustment to Acquisition Cost_. Any
indemnification payment under this _Article X_ shall be made on an After-Tax
Basis, and as among the Parent, the Shareholders, and the DolEx Class B
Shareholders shall constitute an adjustment to the Acquisition Cost.



10.13. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for fraud, remedies that cannot be
waived as a matter of law and injunctive and provisional relief, if the
Closing occurs, this _Article X_  shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches
of this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby.



ARTICLE XI

 



_TERMINATION_



11.1. _Termination Rights_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time:



(a) by the mutual consent of all of the parties hereto;



(b) by any party if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before
the latest to occur of (i) November 30, 2003, (ii) if the parties shall not
have received all approvals and actions of or by the Governmental Bodies which
are specified in Sections 8.3 and 9.3 and all other conditions for Closing
have been satisfied or waived (other than those requiring the exchange of a
certificate, opinion or other document, or taking of other action at Closing),

extensions on a month-to-month basis, and (iii) such later date as may be
mutually agreed to by all of the parties hereto;



(c) by Parent in the event of any breach by the Company, the Shareholders,
the DolEx Class B Shareholders, or the Shareholder Representative of any of
their agreements, representations or warranties contained herein (or, in the
case of representations and warranties made solely as of the Closing Date, the
inability to make such representation or warranty) so as to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the failure of the Company, the
Shareholders, the DolEx Class B Shareholders, or the Shareholder
Representative to cure such breach within seven days after receipt of notice
from Parent requesting that such breach be cured; or



(d) by the Company or the Shareholder Representative in the event of any
breach by Parent or Mergersub of any of their respective agreements,
representations or warranties contained herein so as to materially adversely
affect the ability of the Parent and Mergersub to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the failure of Parent or Mergersub to cure
such breach within seven days after receipt of notice from the Company or the
Shareholder Representative requesting that such breach be cured.

Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 shall give notice of such termination to
each of the other parties to this Agreement.



11.3. _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to this _Article XI_ , all further obligations of the
parties under this Agreement (other than Sections 12.2 and 11.4) shall be
terminated without further liability of any party to the others; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for its
willful breach of this Agreement.



11.4. _Termination Fee_. If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
11.1(c), and within twelve months of such termination the Company shall enter
into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction, upon
consummation of such Acquisition Transaction the Company shall pay to the

ARTICLE XII



_GENERAL PROVISIONS_



12.1. _Survival of Obligations_. All representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein so long as there remains
an indemnification obligation under _Article X_.



12.2. _Confidential Nature of Information_. Each party agrees that it
will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which
it shall have obtained



 

72 regarding the other parties during the course of the negotiations leading to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained
before or after the date of this Agreement), the investigation provided for
herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related documents, and,
in the event the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be consummated,
each party will return to the other parties all copies of nonpublic documents
and materials which have been furnished in connection therewith. No other
party shall use any confidential information in any manner whatsoever

treatment and U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure. However, such information relating to the tax
treatment or tax structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent
necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws.



12.3. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered when

12.4. _Successors and Assigns_. 



(a) Except as expressly contemplated hereby, the rights of each party
under this Agreement shall not be assignable by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party.





 

75 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties and successors
and assigns permitted by this Section 12.4 any right, remedy or claim under
or by reason of this Agreement.



12.5. _Access to Records After Effective Time_. For a period of six years
after the Effective Time, the Shareholder Representative and his
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries for matters relating to
regulatory, Tax or litigation issues or other matters agreed to by Parent.
Such access shall be afforded upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours. The Company shall, prior to the disposition of
any such books and records during such six-year period, give the Shareholder
Representative a reasonable opportunity, at his or her expense, to segregate
and remove such books and records as the Shareholder Representative may
select.



12.6. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto on in
connection herewith contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto
with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede
all prior agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any
of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of each of the parties hereto, and only to the extent permitted
by Delaware Law.



12.7. _Interpretation_. Titles to articles and headings to sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein. Except as expressly stated to the contrary herein, all dollar
amounts in this Agreement refer to lawful money of the United States of
America. 



12.8. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor
in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach.



12.9. _Fees and Expenses_. From and after the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, Parent and Mergersub shall be jointly
and severally responsible for the costs of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel, accountants and other financial, legal, accounting or other advisors
to the Company, the DolEx Class B Shareholders, the Parent and Mergersub, and
the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and each of the other documents and instruments executed in
connection with or contemplated by



 

76 this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (collectively, to the extent not paid prior to Closing, the "
_Merger Expenses_ "). Merger Expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, without limitation, be deemed to include the fees incurred by Wiggin and
Dana LLP, Jackson Walker L.L.P., Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman, Goodwin
Proctor LLP, Bufete Gastelum, S.C., and Salvador Arroyo in connection with
preparation of the opinions required by Sections 4.6(d), (o), (r) and (s). If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, each party to this
Agreement shall be responsible for their own costs of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for any obligation arising pursuant to
Section 11.4.



12.10. _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without rendering
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.



12.11. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to each of the other parties. 



12.12. _Governing Law_. Regardless of any conflict of law or choice of
law principles that might otherwise apply, this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.



12.13. _Shareholder Representative_.

acknowledge that the Shareholder Representative shall act as an agent of the

arbitrators with respect to such claims, and (ix) to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for



 

77 the accomplishment of the foregoing and to otherwise act on behalf of the
Shareholders and the DolEx Class B Shareholders with respect to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Earnout Agreement, any Stock Pledge
Agreement and any Company Ancillary Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, each of which the Shareholders and the DolEx
Class B Shareholders have received, reviewed and approved in their execution
form.



(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder
Representative in accordance with Section 12.13(a) shall constitute a decision
of all Shareholders and all DolEx Class B Shareholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Shareholder or DolEx Class B
Shareholder, and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every such Shareholder and DolEx Class B

any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative.



(c) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to the Shareholders
or the DolEx Class B Shareholders for any act done or omitted as Shareholder
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the written advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.



(d) Neither Parent nor any Parent Group Member shall be responsible or
liable for any acts or omissions of the Shareholder Representative in such
Shareholder Representatives capacity as such.
