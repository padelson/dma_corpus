                   ------------------------
cooperate with each other, and shall cause their Affiliates (including, with
respect to Seller, the Companies and the Subsidiaries) and their respective
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to cooperate with each

----                                          ------------
that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Buyer, those
of the Companies and the Subsidiaries).  Any information relating to the
Companies and the Subsidiaries received by Seller pursuant to this Section
                                                                   -------

                                                  ------------
for a period of three years from the Closing, Seller shall not and shall cause

of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of a Person,

(G) continuing to include in the general product and service offerings of the
newspaper, broadcasting, interactive and other non-education-focused units and
businesses of Seller products and services of the type currently included in
such offerings, notwithstanding that such products and services may have some
relationship to or could otherwise be characterized as "educational" in nature
(e.g. the airing of educational programs through Seller's broadcast network, the
 ---
sale of education books through Seller's retail store, the publishing of
education-related news articles or special features in Seller's newspapers or
other publications, the publishing and distribution of aviation-related
materials or conducting flight training through Times Mirror Company's Jeppesen

"Tribune" in connection with the Competing Business pursuant to this Section

                                       ---------------
Person which shall, after the date hereof, acquire (whether by merger, purchase
or otherwise) direct or indirect control of Seller.

          (b) Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
during the 12-month period beginning on the Closing Date, solicit or recruit or,

managerial, marketing, editorial, sales or information technology employee of
the Business at the date of this Agreement who is offered employment by Buyer or
who becomes an employee of Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or encourage any such employee to leave the
employment of Buyer; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section

XI and other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of

equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance, with respect to
any breach or attempted breach of such covenants.

     Section 7.13. Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Section 8.1.  Use of Names. Seller is not conveying ownership rights or
                   ------------
granting Buyer or either Company a license to use any of the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos or domain names of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller (including, without limitation, the name "Tribune" or any trade name,

and, after the Closing, Buyer shall not permit either Company or any Affiliate
of either Company to use in any manner the names or marks of Seller or any

names or marks. In addition to the foregoing, within 10 days after the Closing

acknowledges that a violation of this Section 8.1 may cause Seller and its
                                      -----------
Affiliates irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money
damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened
violation of this Section 8.1, Seller and any of its Affiliates shall be

entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to seek a temporary
restraining order and to seek preliminary and final

extent Seller gave such employees such credit, any predecessor of any such
entities, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, vesting of,

purposes of benefit accrual under any retirement plan).

          (d) The Companies and the Subsidiaries shall recognize all accrued but

or actions associated with the operations of the Companies and the Subsidiaries
which arise following the Closing Date.

          (b) The indemnification provided for in Section 11.3(a)(i) shall
                                                  ------------------

                                      48
<PAGE>

would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 11.3, as to which the
                                                  ------------
obligation of Buyer shall continue until the liability of Buyer shall have been
determined pursuant to this Article XI, and Buyer shall have reimbursed all
                            ----------
Seller Group Members for the full amount of such Losses and Expenses in
accordance with this Article XI.
                     ----------

     Section 11.4. Notice of Claims. (a) Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group
                   ----------------
Member (the "Indemnified Party") seeking indemnification hereunder shall give
             -----------------
promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified
Party (the "Indemnitor") a written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in
            ----------                        ------------
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based.
The failure of any Indemnified Party to give the Claim Notice promptly as
required by this Section 11.4 shall not affect such Indemnified Party's rights
                 ------------
under this Article XI.
           ----------

          (b) In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any
insurance recovery in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue
hereunder to any insurer). Any indemnity payment hereunder with respect to any
Loss or Expense shall be calculated on an "After-Tax Basis," which shall mean an
amount which is sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party for the event
giving rise to such Loss or Expense (the "Indemnified Event"), determined after
                                          -----------------
taking into account (1) all increases in domestic or foreign, federal, state,
local or other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified
Party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment (as a result of the
indemnity payment being included in income, resulting in a reduction of tax
basis, or otherwise); provided, however, that Buyer and Seller agree to report,
                      --------  -------
to the extent permitted by law, each payment made in respect of a Loss or
Expense as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes, (2) all
increases in domestic or foreign, federal, state, local county, municipal and
other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified Party for all
affected taxable years as a result of the Indemnified Event, and (3) all
reductions in domestic or foreign, federal, state, local and other Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of the
Indemnified Event. All calculations shall be made using reasonable assumptions
agreed upon by Buyer and Seller and, in the case of any present value
calculations, shall be made using the applicable federal rate in effect at the
time of the Indemnified Event (based on the Federal mid-term rate) using semi-
annual compounding. In the event that any indemnity payment is reduced by virtue
of having been treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and such treatment
is subsequently disallowed for income tax purposes, the indemnity payment shall
be increased to the extent necessary to take account of its creating taxable
income to the Indemnitee without regard to any time limit otherwise applicable
under the terms of this Agreement.

          (c) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount
of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article XI shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
----------
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any
court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a

                                      49
<PAGE>

court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired
and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been
finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

     Section 11.5. Third Person Claims. (a) In order for a party to be entitled
                   -------------------
to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising
out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person against the
Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor in writing,
and in reasonable detail, of the third Person claim within 30 days after receipt
by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third Person claim. The
failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice as required by this Section
                                                                         -------
11.5 shall not affect such Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except to the
----
extent the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within ten business days
after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to
the third Person claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be
physically served with a complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within
ten business days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor
within ten business days after the receipt of such complaint copies of notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the third Person claim.

          (b) In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and
absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its option and at its own
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss,
liability or damage indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the
                                                   --------  -------
Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense. The parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with
each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to
defend such proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends
against or otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and
control the defense of such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the
Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding which settlement obligates the
other party to pay money, to perform obligations or to admit liability without
the written consent of the other party. After any final judgment or award shall
have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or
a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding written agreement with respect to
each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and
owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the
sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or bank
cashier's check within 30 days after the date of such notice.

          (c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 11.5 and
                                                              ------------
Section 11.6, the provisions of Section 11.6 shall control.
------------                    ------------

     Section 11.6. Tax Matters.
                   -----------

          (a) Tax Returns. (i)  Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be
              -----------
prepared and filed when due (or if presently overdue, as soon as reasonably
possible) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
either Company or any Subsidiary, or any predecessor thereof, for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods and shall remit any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, and
Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to either Company or
any Subsidiary for Post-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods and shall remit
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Seller's indemnity obligation
under Section 11.1(a) in respect of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall initially
      ---------------
be effected by its payment to the Companies of the excess of (a) such Taxes for
the Pre-Closing Tax-Period over (b) the amount of such Taxes paid by all Seller
Group Members-at any time. Such excess initially shall be paid to the Companies
no later than 30 days prior to the date on which the Tax Return with respect to
the final liability for such Taxes is required to be filed. If the amount of
such Taxes paid by all Seller Group Members exceeds the amount payable pursuant
to the preceding sentence, the Companies shall pay to Seller the amount of such
excess within 30 days after the Tax Return with respect to the final liability
for such Taxes is required to be filed. The payments to be made pursuant to this
Section 11.6(a)(i) with respect to a Straddle Period shall be appropriately
------------------
adjusted to reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution
of Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to Straddle Period Taxes.

          (ii)  No Buyer Group Member shall (or shall cause or permit either
     Company or any of the Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise modify
     any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to either Company or any of the
     Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle
     Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
     be unreasonably withheld.

          (iii) With respect to the taxable year of the Companies and the
     Subsidiaries ending on the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly cause the
     Companies and the Subsidiaries to complete and provide to Seller a package
     of tax information materials provided by Seller, including, without
     limitation, schedules and work papers (the "Tax Package"), required by
                                                 -----------
     Seller to enable Seller to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be
     prepared and filed, or caused to be prepared and filed, by it pursuant to
     Section 11.6(a)(i). The Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with
     ------------------
     past practice, including past practice as to providing such information,
     and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income or other
     relevant measure of income of the Companies and the Subsidiaries. Buyer
     shall cause the Tax Package to be delivered to Seller within 120 days after
     the Closing Date.

                                      51
<PAGE>

          (b) Contest Provisions. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing
              ------------------
upon receipt after the Closing Date by any Buyer Group Member of notice of any
pending domestic or foreign federal, state, local, county, municipal or other
Tax audit, examination or pending or threatened assessment which may affect any
Tax liability for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 11.1(a), provided
                                                     ---------------
that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices Seller's ability to contest any such Tax liabilities.

          Seller shall have the sole right, at its option and at its own
expense,  to represent the interests of either Company or any Subsidiary in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, however,
                                                            --------- --------
that Buyer may participate in such audit or proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense. With reasonable prior notice to Buyer given not
later than 12 months following the Closing Date, Seller shall have the sole
right to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, at its option and
at its own expense, voluntary disclosures to state, local, county or municipal
tax authorities with respect to the Tax liability of either Company or any of
the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Subject to the following
sentence, Seller shall have the sole right to settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any audit or proceeding relating to Taxes
of either Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, subject, in
the case of any refund, litigation, settlement, audit or proceeding that
increases the Tax liability of a Buyer Group Member in a Post-Closing Tax Period
by accelerating any Tax benefit to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or by deferring
income to a Post-Closing Tax Period, to principles reciprocal to those provided
in Section 11.1(d). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the settlement of
   ---------------
any issue that increases the Tax liability of a Buyer Group Member in a Post-
Closing Tax Period other than by accelerating any Tax benefit to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or by deferring income to a Post-Closing Tax Period (i.e., an issue
that increases Tax liability both in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and in a Post-
Closing Tax Period) shall require the consent of the Buyer, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. To the extent that Seller elects not to defend such
audit or proceeding relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer may retain
counsel, at the expense of Seller, and control the defense of such audit or
proceeding. In the case of any Straddle Period, Seller shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and, with the
written consent of Buyer, and at Seller's sole expense, may assume the entire
control of such audit or proceeding.  No Buyer Group Member may agree to settle
any Tax claim which may be the subject of indemnification by Seller under
Section 11.1 without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall
------------
not be unreasonably withheld.

          (c) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of Seller
              --------------------------
and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

          (i)  assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such
     other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
     Section 11.6(b);
     ---------------

                                      52
<PAGE>

          (ii)  cooperate fully in responding to any inquiries from and/or
     preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding,
     any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Companies or the Subsidiaries;

          (iii) make available to the other, as reasonably requested, all
     information in its possession relating to the Companies or the Subsidiaries
     which may be relevant to any Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding
     or determination and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested by
     Seller or Buyer all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes
     of the Companies or the Subsidiaries;

          (iv)  provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending Tax
     audits or pending or threatened assessments of the Companies or the
     Subsidiaries for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability
     under Section 11.1;
           ------------

          (v)   furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received
     from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information
     request with respect to any such taxable period;

          (vi)  timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be
     necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
     reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes
     described in Section 7.9(b) (relating to transfer Taxes); and
                  --------------

          (vii) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar
     authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 11.6.
                                                                ------------

     SECTION 11.7. Limitations. (a) In any case where an Indemnified Party
                   -----------
recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to
which an Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this Article XI, such
                                                        ----------
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by
it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

          (b) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and
injunctive and provisional relief, if the Closing occurs, this Article XI
                                                               ----------
shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any
covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect
of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby.

          (c) Seller shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless any
Buyer Group Member pursuant to Section 11.1(a) or Section 11.2(a) to the extent
                               ---------------    ---------------
that (i) the matter in question

                                      53
<PAGE>

was taken into account during the preparation and resolution of the Measurement
Date Balance Sheet and Measurement Date Net Assets and (ii) Buyer has been
expressly compensated for any related Loss or Expense through a decrease to the
amount paid to Seller under Section 3.3(i)(A), or an increase in the amount paid
                            -----------------
to Buyer under Section 3.3(ii)(A), on account of a change in the balance sheet
               ------------------
amount relating to such matter between the Financial Statement Date and the
Measurement Date.

     Section 11.8. Mitigation. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable
                   ----------
steps to mitigate their respective Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder, except that nothing
herein shall require Buyer Group Member, or permit Seller or an Affiliate, to
request or demand payment of previously unbilled sales or uses tax from
customers of either Company, a Subsidiary, or predecessors thereof.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                                  TERMINATION

     Section 12.1. Termination. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
                   -----------
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement and the purchase and sale of the Shares
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:

          (a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

          (b) by Buyer in the event of any material breach by Seller of any of
Seller's agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein
and the failure of Seller to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of
notice from Buyer requesting such breach to be cured;

          (c) by Seller in the event of any material breach by Buyer of any of
Buyer's agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein
and the failure of Buyer to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of

parties hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein,

herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be
a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
Schedules referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of
this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.
Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no
party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item
or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that
such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or

waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

     Section 13.10. Expenses. Each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses
                    --------
incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the Ancillary

conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with,

public accountants.

                    ------------------
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other
provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

     Section 13.12. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
                    -------------------------
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which

                                      58

one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to Seller and Buyer.

     Section 13.13. Further Assurances. On and after the Closing Date each
                    ------------------

instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably requested by the
other party hereto from time to time to effectuate or confirm the transfer of
the Shares to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

information provided to Buyer.  There is no assurance that any projected or
forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY
COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SELLER PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.4, SELLER IS SELLING THE
                                            -----------
SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE COMPANIES AND THE SUBSIDIARIES
REPRESENTED THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR

Buyer shall receive letters from (i) the Senior Vice President, General Counsel
and Secretary of Seller, (ii) Sidley & Austin, special counsel to Seller, and
(iii) foreign counsel to Seller, which, in the aggregate, express the opinion
that:

     1.   Each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries is duly incorporated,
          validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
          jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation (to the extent that the
          concept of good standing is recognized in such jurisdiction) and has
          corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its assets
          and properties and to conduct its Business as now being conducted.

     2.   Seller has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute,
          deliver and perform the Agreement. The Agreement has been duly
          authorized, executed and delivered by Seller and constitutes the
          legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller enforceable against
          Seller in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
          enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
          reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws
          affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the
          effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
          enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     3.   The authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
          Companies are as set forth in Section 5.2(b) of the Agreement; all of
          the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
          Companies and the Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly
          issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and have not been issued in
          violation of the preemptive rights of any stockholder of the Companies
          or the Subsidiaries; and to the knowledge of such counsel, Seller has
          title to all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Companies and
          TEC has title to all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
          Subsidiaries.

     4.   The certificates for the Shares delivered to you on this date and the
          stock powers attached thereto are each in due and proper form, and
          each has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller; and
          upon delivery by Seller of such certificates and stock powers and
          payment therefor by Buyer in accordance with the terms of the
          Agreement, Buyer will, to the knowledge of such counsel, receive good
          title to the Shares, subject to no lien, encumbrance or other adverse
          claim (assuming Buyer is purchasing such shares in good faith and
          without knowledge of any lien or encumbrance thereon or notice of any
          adverse claim thereto).

                                       2
<PAGE>

     5.   No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
          declaration with, any federal or state governmental authority or other
          regulatory agency is required for the valid execution and delivery by
          Seller of the Agreement, the consummation by Seller of the
          transactions contemplated thereby or compliance by Seller with the
          terms and provisions thereof, including the sale, transfer and
          delivery of the Shares.

                                       3
<PAGE>

                                   EXHIBIT C

Seller shall receive a letter from counsel to Buyer which expresses the opinion
that:

     1.   Buyer is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
          under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
          corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its assets
          and properties and to conduct its Business as now being conducted.

     2.   Buyer has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute,
          deliver and perform the Agreement. The Agreement has been duly
          authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes the legal,
          valid and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in
          accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be
          limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
          moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting the
          enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of
          general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
          considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     3.   No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
          declaration with, any federal or state governmental authority or other
          regulatory agency is required for the valid execution and delivery by
          Buyer of the Agreement, the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
          contemplated thereby or compliance by Buyer with the terms and
          provisions thereof.
