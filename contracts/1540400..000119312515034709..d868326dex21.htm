Business Days thereafter), Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the shares of
Company Common Stock at a price per Company Share, subject to the terms of

the Offer, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the
terms of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, together
with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent and Acquisition
Sub (if any), represents at least 

 



-14-  a majority of all then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the
shares of Company Common Stock that the Company would be required to issue
upon conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding options,
benefit plans, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into such
shares, or other rights to acquire or be issued such shares (including all
then outstanding Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units), for
which the Company has received notices of exercise or conversion prior to the
expiration of the Offer (excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received,"
as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for
the Offer pursuant to such procedures); and

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_.

(b) Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company in its sole discretion, Acquisition Sub may not (and Parent
shall not permit Acquisition Sub to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, the
condition set forth in clause (A) of _Annex A_ or the condition set forth in
clause (C)(1) of _Annex A_ , and (ii) make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be paid

Common Stock sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other than in a
manner required by the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)_, (D) imposes conditions
to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex A_ , (E) modifies the
conditions set forth in  _Annex A_ , or (F) amends any other term or
condition of the Offer in any manner that is material and adverse to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(c) _Adjustments to the Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Subs
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock
that are tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date
the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to
and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date
and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 



-15- (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, without the consent of the Company:

(A) Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend
the Offer for any period required by any Law or Order, or any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq, in
any such case, which is applicable to the Offer;

 

(B) in the event that all of the conditions of the Offer other than the
Minimum Condition have been satisfied or waived by Parent as of any then
scheduled expiration of the Offer, then Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend the Offer for an extension period of
ten (10) Business Days in order to further seek to satisfy the Minimum
Condition, it being understood that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (B) on more than two (2) occasions,
but may, in its discretion, elect to do so after two (2) such extensions; and

 

(C) in the event that any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum
Condition) have not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled expiration
of the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub
to) extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10)
Business Days each in order to further seek to satisfy the Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Condition);

_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any such extension shall not be deemed to
impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_.

(iii) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance
with the provisions of  _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ without the prior written
consent of the Company.

(iv) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Acquisition

unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one
(1) Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall

promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer (as it
may be extended in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_) (such time, the
"Acceptance Time"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on a timely basis the
funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Acquisition
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,_
that without the prior written consent of the Company, Acquisition

 



-16-  Sub shall not accept for payment or pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock if, as a result, Acquisition Sub would acquire less than the number of
shares of Company Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in
cash, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes payable in
respect thereof.

Law to be included in the Offer Documents so as to enable Parent and
Acquisition Sub to comply with their obligations under this _Section 2.1(f)_.
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
to determine the information regarding the Company that is necessary to
include in the Offer Documents in order to satisfy applicable Laws. Each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information

made by the Company and its counsel) and to participate in any discussions
with the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments.

The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations
and approvals and the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents,

-18- (b) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall (i) file with the SEC concurrently
with the filing by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the Schedule TO or as soon

14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
be mailed to the Company Stockholders promptly (and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days) after commencement of the Offer. To the extent requested

otherwise disseminated to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
together with the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
furnish in writing to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Sub that is required by applicable Laws to be included in the
Schedule 14D-9 so as to enable the Company to comply with its obligations
under this _Section 2.2(b)_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith to determine the information regarding the Company
that is necessary to include in the Schedule 14D-9 in order to satisfy
applicable Laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents or other representatives
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. Unless the Company Board or
the Company Board Committee has effected a Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any reasonable comments made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon

14D-9 promptly after such receipt, and unless the Company Board or the
Company Board Committee has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any such response, to which the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel) and to participate in any discussions with
the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments. Unless the Company Board or
the Company Board Committee has effected a Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9.

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
or shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent and Acquisition Sub with
such assistance and

such information then in their possession or control.

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders
of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled
Company Shares, and (B) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"), without
interest thereon, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such
share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_ (or in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit in the manner provided in _Section 3.10_).

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled Company Shares"), shall be cancelled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid
therefor.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common
stock of Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the consummation of the
Offer and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither
have voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)_, but shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Company Shares shall no 

 



-22-  longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist, and each Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however,_ that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL
shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.8_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 

(d) _Company Options_. Except as otherwise agreed to by any holder of a
Company Option and Parent, Parent shall not assume any Company Options in
connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed to by any holder of a Company Option and
Parent, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company or any holder of such Company Option, (i) each Company Option granted
under the Company Stock Plans that remains outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and
terminated as of the Effective Time and (ii) in consideration for such
cancellation and termination, each holder of each such Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid at
or promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_, an amount
in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, _less_ the per share
exercise price of such Company Option (the "Option Consideration") (it being
understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to
the Company by the holder of a Company Option); provided, however, that if the
per share exercise price of any Company Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any payment or
consideration and all rights with respect to such Company Option shall
terminate as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_ under

 



-23-  all Company Option agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all required notices. Except as otherwise agreed
to by a holder of a Company Option and Parent, within three (3) Business Days
after the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each of the holders of Company Options, the applicable
Option Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next
regular payroll date) thereafter.

 

(e) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Except as otherwise agreed to by any
holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit and Parent, Parent shall not assume
any Company Restricted Stock Units in connection with the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed to by
any holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit and Parent, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of
such Company Restricted Stock Unit, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that
remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and as consideration for
such cancellation and termination, each holder of each such Company Restricted
Stock Unit shall receive, subject to  _Section 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) subject
to the last sentence of this _Section 3.7(e)_, the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit grant
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (ii) the Merger Consideration
(the "Restricted Stock Unit Consideration"). Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Restricted Stock Unit
agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including
delivering all required notices and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. Within three (3)
Business Days after the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each of the holders of Company
Restricted Stock Units, the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Consideration
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof) as promptly
as practicable (and in no event later than the next regular payroll date)
thereafter. For purposes of this _Section 3.7(e)_, (x) for each outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof) that is subject to
performance-based vesting for which (A) the applicable performance period has
been certified by the Companys Audit Committee as of the Effective Time and
(B) for which the award agreement (as in effect on the date hereof) does not
provide an opportunity to earn shares through performance following the
completion of the initial performance period (a "Catch-Up Opportunity") that,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is still available, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit shall be determined based upon actual performance and (y) for each
outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof) that is subject
to performance-based vesting for which (A) the financial results for the
applicable performance period has not been certified by the Companys Audit
Committee as of the Effective Time or (B) for which the award agreement (as in
effect on the date hereof) provides a Catch-Up Opportunity that, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, remains available, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
shall be determined based upon the target number of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit.

 



-24- (f) _Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all actions necessary (including adopting such resolutions of the Company
Board (or any appropriate committee thereof) and providing all required
notices in connection therewith) to terminate each of the Company Stock Plans
and to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right
with respect to outstanding equity-based awards except as provided in
_Sections 3.7(d) and (e)_.

 

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause to
be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, an
amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Article III_. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America
which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America
(such cash amount being referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund"). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by this _Article III_, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make such payments
contemplated by this _Article III_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated
Shares"), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Upon surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such 

 



-25-  Certificate that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an
"agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section
3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any
transfer taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
Units such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld
and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



-26- (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_;
_provided_ that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as
condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
customary amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

 



-27- 3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

independent contractor who is involved in the development of material
Technology that is included in a Company product to execute one or more
agreements with provisions relating to the protection of the Companys
Confidential Information and the ownership of Technology and Intellectual
Property Rights developed with the scope of the individuals employment or
independent contractor relationship with the Company or any of its

received written notice of a claim that the conduct of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries business infringes upon, misappropriates, or otherwise violates
the Intellectual Property Rights of a third Person. As of the date hereof, to
the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject
to any Order that restricts or impairs the use of any material Company
Intellectual Property Rights.

licenses to any material Company Intellectual Property Rights except as set
forth in any of the Company IP Contracts, (ii) any third Person that is a
party to a Company IP Contract having the right to terminate the applicable
Company IP Contract, or (iii) the imposition of any Lien on any Company
Intellectual Property Rights other than Permitted Liens and encumbrances,
licenses, restrictions or other obligations arising under any of the Company
IP Contracts; _provided_ that the representations and warranties of the
Company in this _Section 4.15(g)_ shall not be deemed breached as a result of
the operation of any Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is not a party.

has disclosed or delivered to any party, or permitted the disclosure or
delivery to any escrow agent or other party, of any Company proprietary Source

time) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or
delivery by the Company or any other party acting on behalf of the Company, of
any Source Code. Except as set forth in _Section 4.15(h)_ of the Company
Disclosure, no third party owns any right or title or has any license in or to
any such Source Code. _Section 4.15(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
identifies each Contract pursuant to which the Company has deposited, or is
or may be required to deposit, with an escrow agent or any other party, any
Source Code and further describes whether the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in and
of itself, would reasonably be expected to result in the release from escrow
of any such Source Code.

 

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company-owned proprietary Technology

in all material respects with all its contractual commitments with respect
to Personal Information and has commercially reasonable safeguards in place
to protect Personal Information in its possession or control from unauthorized
access. Between August 1, 2012 through the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
the Company there have been no data breaches involving any Personal
Information and neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other Person, has made any illegal or unauthorized use of Personal Information
that was collected by or on behalf of the Company. Any deemed transfer of
Personal Information in connection with the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not violate any applicable Privacy Laws or
the Companys privacy policies, as such policies currently exist or as they
existed at the time the Personal Information was collected by or on behalf of
the Company, and the Company is not subject to any contractual requirements,
privacy policies or other legal obligations that, following the Closing,
would prohibit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company after the Closing

Company or the Affiliate of the Company receives and uses such Personal
Information immediately prior to the Closing.

Offer Documents are first published, sent or given to the Company
Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation
or warranty is made by Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to information

affiliates, agents or other representatives for inclusion or incorporation by

5.7 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub
is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203(c) of the
DGCL (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub owns any shares of Company Common Stock.

5.8 _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission payable by the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon

for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and,
prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub will not have engaged in any
other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations
other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

5.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of
the executed equity commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (the
"Commitment Letters") from the Guarantors, pursuant to which, and subject only
to the terms and conditions thereof, the Guarantors have agreed to invest the
amount set forth in the Commitment Letters to fully finance the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount
will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisition
Subs obligations under this Agreement (the "Financing") including the
payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration and the
consideration in respect of the Company Options and the Company Restricted
Stock Units, and to pay all related fees and expenses. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the investing of the full amount
of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters.
There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements
relating to the Commitment Letters. The Commitment Letters provide, and will
continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof and
is entitled to enforce such agreement subject to the terms and conditions
thereof and hereof.

 

(b) The Commitment Letters are valid, binding, and in full force and effect,
and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or Acquisition
Sub under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters. Assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.1_ and _Annex A_ ,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied
by it in the Commitment Letters at the time it is required to consummate the
Offer and the Merger, nor does Parent nor Acquisition Sub have knowledge that

 



-51-  any of the Guarantors will not perform their respective funding obligations
under the Commitment Letters in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions. Parent and Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters that are due and
payable on or before the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is a party to or
otherwise bound by any Contracts, or has any arrangements or other
understandings, with any Person (including any stockholder, director, officer
or other employee of the Company) concerning any investments to be made in or
contributions to be made to Parent or Acquisition Sub in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and/or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Support
Agreement.

 

(d) The obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under this Agreement are not
contingent upon the funding of the amount contemplated to be funded pursuant
to the Commitment Letters. The obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under
this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents or
Acquisition Subs ability to obtain financing for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.11 _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Acquisition Sub have delivered to the Company the Limited
Guaranties. Each Guarantor has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into its Limited Guaranty and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery of each Limited Guaranty and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the applicable
Guarantor, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of such Guarantor
are necessary to authorize such Limited Guaranty or the transactions
contemplated thereby. Each Limited Guaranty has been duly executed and
delivered by the applicable Guarantor and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations.

5.12  _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of all conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Offer and the Merger, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, the payment in
connection with the consummation of the Offer, the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, be Solvent at the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 5.12_,
the term "Solvent" means, with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis and as of 11:59 PM in New York City on the Closing Date,
after giving effect to the Merger, that: (a) the fair market value of the sum
of Parents assets exceeds Parents liabilities, (b) Parent has not incurred
debts for borrowed money beyond Parents ability to pay such debts as such
debts mature and become due and owing, and (c) Parent has sufficient capital
and liquidity with which to conduct its business as conducted as of such date;
provided that in each case, all determinations shall be made reasonably and
in good faith by Parents Board of Managers or other similar governing body.

furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes
such non-public information to Parent to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by the Company to Parent;  _provided, however_ ,
that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) or
(ii), (A) the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, and (B) the Company gives Parent
written notice of the identity of such Person, a copy of an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into with such Person (but only
if such agreement was entered into after the date hereof), and the terms of

Companys intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person. Without limiting the

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify or waive
any rights under, or release any Person (other than Parent and Acquisition
Sub) from, any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Person, on the other,

faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly notify Parent if any director or executive
officer of the Company becomes aware of any receipt by the Company of (i) any

be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (and shall include with such notice copies of any
written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

contemplated herein and in the Support Agreement by the Company Board for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or similar statue or
regulation or the Rights Plan to be inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreement
shall not be amended and no Company Board Recommendation Change or other
action shall change such approval, and (ii) the Rights Plan shall not be
otherwise amended or qualified. The Company and the Company Board shall take

Plan shall not become exercisable as a result of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Support Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein or in the Support
Agreement or prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or,

any waiver, amendment or release under any stake takeover statute or similar
statue or regulation or the Rights Plan, or (B) other than to the extent

grant any waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement (or terminate (other than in accordance with

other remedies thereunder to prevent further breaches by such other party), in
either case except as the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law and following a
Company Board Recommendation Change.

Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iii) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents,
waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby so as to maintain and
preserve the benefits under such Material Contracts following the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition to the
foregoing, neither Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, nor the
Company, on the other hand, shall take any action, or fail to take any action,
that is intended to, or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the
effect of, preventing, impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the ability of such party to
fully perform its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required prior to the
Effective Time to pay any consent or other similar fee, "profit sharing" or
other similar payment or other consideration (including increased rent or
other similar payments or any amendments,

 



-58-  supplements or other modifications to (or waivers of) the existing terms of
any Contract), or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty)
to obtain the consent, waiver or approval of any Person under any Contract.

7.2 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall file
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as
required by the HSR Act as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall
(i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings and
in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Authority under any applicable Laws (including Antitrust Laws) or
Orders with respect to any such filing, (ii) supply the other with any
information that may be required in order to make such filings, (iii) supply
any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the
FTC or the DOJ, and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, and to avoid any impediment
to the consummation of the Offer or the Merger under any applicable Laws
(including Antitrust Laws) or Orders, including using reasonable best efforts
to take all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority
or Person may assert under any applicable Laws (including Antitrust Laws) or
Orders with respect to the Offer and/or the Merger.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with any filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act, then such
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer,
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) give each
other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep the
other party reasonably apprised with respect to any oral communications with
any Governmental Authority regarding the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) cooperate in the filing of any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other
written communications

 



-59-  explaining or defending the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument
and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to
review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other
with respect to, all written communications (including any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a
Governmental Authority regarding the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each
party, as appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from
any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (vii) cooperate and provide each other
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and consider in good faith
the views of the other with respect to, all material deliberations with
respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and
(C)(1) of _Annex A_ and _Section 8.1(b)_. Any such disclosures, rights to
participate or provisions of information by one party to the other may be made
on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law or as
appropriate to protect confidential business information.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not contemplated by
this _Section 7.2_ are required to be or should be made, and whether any
other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not contemplated by this
_Section 7.2_ are required to be or should be obtained, from any
Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings, furnish
information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the parties
determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
avoid or eliminate impediments under any applicable Antitrust Laws that may
be asserted by the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates shall propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or otherwise
offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of
taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of
the businesses, services or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries, in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or Legal Proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the
Termination Date, provided that any such action, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such actions, shall not have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services

 



-60-  or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that any such
action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.3(b)_ and _Section 7.3(c)_, the
Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee shall make the Company Board
Recommendation.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or (y) approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal (each of clauses (x) and (y), a "Company Board
Recommendation Change"); _provided, however_ , that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act (and, in the case of a public Acquisition
Proposal that is not a third party tender offer, any similar communication
that does not contain more than what would be permitted under Rule 14d-9(f)
had such communication been issued in connection with a third party tender
offer) shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change. At any
time following the making by any Person of a public Acquisition Proposal,
Parent may submit a written request to the Company Board that the Company
Board publicly reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt of such request from Parent (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the first such
request from Parent and within five (5) Business Days in respect of any
subsequent requests thereafter).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board
and/or the Company Board Committee may make a Company Board Recommendation
Change if and only if:

 

(i) (A) the Company has received an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and not involving a breach of
this Agreement; (B) the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to
such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; (C) the Company shall have notified
Parent in writing of the Superior Proposal, including providing Parent with
the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and a copy of the
then-current forms of all of the relevant proposed transaction documents
related thereto, including definitive agreements with respect to such Superior
Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), _provided_ that with respect to a
material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal, Parent shall be entitled to a new written notice by the
Company (a "Superior Proposal Amendment Notice") (it being agreed that a
Superior Proposal Notice, a Superior Proposal Amendment Notice and any
amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such
notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement); (D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss with 

 



-61-  Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific
Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior
Proposal Notice or such Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as applicable, and
ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on, in the case of a Superior Proposal
Notice, the third (3rd) Business Day following the day of such delivery or,
in the case of a Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, the second (2nd) Business
Day following the day of such delivery; and (E) if Parent shall have delivered
to the Company during such three (3) Business Day period or such two (2)
Business Day period, as applicable, a written and binding offer to modify the
terms of this Agreement, the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee
shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of
such offer by Parent, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such Superior
Proposal Notice or such Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as applicable,
still constitutes a Superior Proposal; or

 

(ii) (A) an Intervening Event has occurred; (B) the Company Board and/or the
Company Board Committee shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law; (C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of such
Intervening Event, including a reasonable description of such Intervening
Event (an "Intervening Event Notice") (it being agreed that the Intervening
Event Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and the determination
to so deliver such notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect
thereto shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement); (D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made its Representatives available to discuss with Parents
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the day of
delivery by the Company to Parent of such Intervening Event Notice and ending
at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the third (3rd) Business Day following the day of
such delivery; and (E) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during
such three (3) Business Day period a written and binding offer to modify the
terms of this Agreement, the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee
shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of such
offer by Parent, that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in light of such Intervening Event would still reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or the
Company Board Committee from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that
the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; _provided_ that, (x) clause (ii) of this
_Section 7.3(d)_ shall not in and of itself be deemed to permit the Company
Board and/or the Company Board Committee to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change that would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_, and (y) in either such case, any such statement(s) or
disclosures made by the Company Board and/or the Company Board Committee will
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
provisions of _Article IX_.

 



-62- 7.4 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. None of the Company, on the
one hand, nor Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any
public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to
which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party);
_provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.4_
shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by
the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ or following a Company Board
Recommendation Change.

 

7.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company; _provided,
however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
any documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law
requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information, and (ii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such
documents or information; and _provided, further_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition
Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way
that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive
such a privilege including by providing

 



-63-  such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such a privilege
or comply with such Law or otherwise make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, to the extent possible. Any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this _Section 7.6_ shall be conducted in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreements shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.6_. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreements, each of the Company and Parent shall hold, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to hold, all information received
from the other party or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements. Nothing in this
_Section 7.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the
foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other
information.

7.7 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

7.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all (i) indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers as of the date of this Agreement and any person who becomes a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons") and (ii) indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law.

 



-64- (b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.8(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of, or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether
such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at
or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to
Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this
_Section 7.8(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is
fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final disposition
of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification
may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an
Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it
being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to
the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with
respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his
or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to
control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
(iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements
therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect
to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement
effected without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.8(b)_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates
(including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 



-65- (c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.8(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 7.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided, however,_
that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance provided, that, without the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not expend per year coverage
in excess of the Maximum Annual Premium for such "tail" policy. In the event
that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 7.8(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 7.8_.

 

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.8(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.8(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 7.8_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in  _Section 7.8(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 7.8_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

 



-66- (f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.8_ shall be joint and
several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.8_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

7.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and
compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _provided, however,_ that nothing in
this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
from amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements
or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) During the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide employee benefits (other than any
defined benefit or cash balance pension plan, deferred compensation, equity-
based benefits, or individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole,
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits (other than
any defined benefit or cash balance pension plan, deferred compensation,
equity-based benefits, or individual employment agreements) provided to
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. In addition,
base salary, annual cash incentive bonus opportunity and regular wages as of
the Acceptance Time, in the aggregate, shall not be decreased during the
period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending one (1) year following
the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period.
During the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending one (1) year
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance benefits to
Continuing Employees that are no less favorable than the severance benefits in
effect under the Companys severance plans, guidelines and practices
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and that are set forth in _Section
4.17(a)(xviii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) To the extent that, following the Effective Time, employee benefits are
provided under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to
Continuing Employees, and in which such Continuing Employees did not
participate prior to the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries to, cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit
for all service with the

 



-67-  Company and its Subsidiaries and any predecessor employer (to the extent the
Company and its Subsidiaries provide such past service credit) prior to the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
and, with respect to vacation, sick time or paid time off, accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be credited to the extent that (i) it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits or (ii) employees who are similarly situated to the
Continuing Employees are not provided with such service under such plan.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant
to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Employee Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); (b) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or
disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (x) cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent it would have been waived under the comparable Old Plan, and (y)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents under a comparable Old Plan during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Effective Time to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but
unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the Continuing
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that are affected by
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any such intended communication
in written form (including any talking points, frequently asked questions or
substantially similar written materials), Parent shall have a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on such communication, and Parent and
the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication, _provided_ that Company is not obligated to seek such Parents
prior review and comment in the case of responses to individual inquires by
a Continuing Employee or any other oral communication that is not directed to
Continuing Employees in general so long as such communication is generally
consistent with communications in written form previously reviewed by Parent.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries to terminate, any Continuing Employee for
any reason, (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan, New Plan, or other benefit
plan, agreement or arrangement, or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination

 



-68-  thereof after the Effective Time, or (iii) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated
as an amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit
plan or arrangement. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third
party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and benefits that may be provided to any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which any of them may
maintain, or otherwise.

 

7.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matter_ _s_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments
have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or
are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Employee Plans
(collectively, the "Arrangements"), to certain Company Stockholders and
holders of other Company Securities (collectively, the "Covered
Securityholders"). The Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the
"Company Compensation Committee") (A) at a meeting to be held prior to the
Acceptance Time, will duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (an
"Employment Compensation Arrangement") (1) each Arrangement presented to the
Company Compensation Committee on or prior to the date hereof, (2) the
treatment of the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, and (3)
the terms of _Section 7.8_ and _Section 7.9_, and (B) will take all other
actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the
foregoing arrangements. Each member of the Company Compensation Committee is
an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

7.11 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in paragraphs (C)(2) and
(C)(3) of _Annex A_ to fail

 



-69-  to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer; _provided_
that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the
parties hereunder; and _provided further_ that the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreements shall apply to any information provided to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.12(a)_.

 

 __(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the
extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the
ability of Parent and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective
covenants and obligations under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no
such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreements shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_. __

 

7.13 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent to such settlement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

7.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds
of the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including: (i) maintaining
in effect the Commitment Letters; (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in the
Commitment Letters that are within their control; (iii) consummating the
Financing at or prior to the Acceptance Time (and in any event prior to the
Termination Date), subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent, of all
conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and (iv) fully enforcing each
Guarantors obligations (and the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub) under
the applicable Commitment Letter.

 



-70- (b) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree
to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any
term of the Commitment Letters that (i) amends or modifies any of the
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Financing or imposes additional
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Financing, (ii) adversely affects
the rights of, or remedies available to, the Company under the Commitment
Letters, or (iii) would or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of the Merger or the Financing, in each case, without
the prior written consent of the Company. Parent shall promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) notify the Company of (i) any amendment,
alteration or waiver, or agreement to do any of the foregoing, of any term of
the Commitment Letters, (ii) the expiration or termination (or attempted or
purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Commitment Letters, or
(iii) any refusal by either Guarantor to provide, any stated intent by such
Guarantor to refuse to provide, or any expression of concern or reservation by
the Investor regarding its obligation and/or ability to provide, the full
financing contemplated by the applicable Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the arrangement and consummation of any third party debt financing for
the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including: (i) participating in meetings, presentations, marketing sessions
(including with ratings agencies) and due diligence sessions and promptly
furnishing such reasonably available information (including financial
information) as may be reasonably requested by Parent; (ii) assisting with the
preparation of materials for presentations, memoranda and similar documents
required in connection with such financing and participating in a reasonable
number of customary meetings with potential financing sources and senior
management; (iii) executing and delivering any definitive financing documents
and certificates as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including, without
limitation a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer (or equivalent
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to solvency matters) and otherwise facilitating the pledging
of collateral and the providing of guarantees (including providing reasonable
and customary information required in connection with the pledging and
identification of intellectual property to the extent specifically requested
by Parent) and (iv) to the extent reasonably requested by the Parent in
writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date therefor,
furnishing all documentation and other information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries that the potential financing sources have reasonably requested
for compliance under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money-laundering
rules and regulations, _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to be an issuer or obligor with respect to
such financing, or incur any obligation under any such documents or
certificates that is effective, in each case, prior to the Effective Time.
Nothing herein shall require the Company to provide such
cooperation described in the foregoing sentence to the extent it would
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees,
reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for
which it is not reimbursed or indemnified.

(d) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing (debt or
otherwise), nor the

 



-71-  completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing or
any alternative financing (debt or otherwise), is a condition to the Offer or
the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any alternative financing (debt or
otherwise).

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

9.1 _Termination Prior to the Acceptance Time_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

__(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer
without Acquisition Sub having accepted for payment any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer on or before ninety (90) days
after the date hereof (the " __Termination Date __"); _provided, however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_
shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of or
resulted in (i) any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_
having failed to be satisfied and such action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach of this Agreement or (ii) the expiration or termination of
the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer without
Acquisition Sub having accepted for payment any shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer and such action or failure to act constitutes
a material breach of this Agreement; __

 



-72- (c) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement and (ii) Parent and/or Acquisition Sub shall have
breached or otherwise violated any of their respective material covenants,
agreements or other obligations under this Agreement, or any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in

inaccuracy, individually or in the aggregate with other such breaches,
violations or inaccuracies, is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by
Parent and/or Acquisition Sub within twenty (20) calendar days following
receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach, violation or
inaccuracy and would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the
Offer prior to the Termination Date;

(d) by Parent, in the event that (i) Parent and Acquisition Sub are not then

promptly as reasonably practicable (in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of the first such request from Parent and within five (5)
Business Days in respect of any subsequent requests thereafter), or (iii)
a tender or exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes an

9.2 _Termination Before or After Acceptance Time and Prior to Effective Time_.
Notwithstanding the prior adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, this Agreement may be terminated and
the Offer and/or the Merger

 



-73-  may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time (it being agreed
that the party hereto terminating this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.2_ shall give prompt written notice of such termination to the other party
or parties hereto), by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction in the United States shall have (a)

termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_
shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 9.2_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without
liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any director,
officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or
parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for
the terms of this _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_ and _Article X_, each of
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b) subject to
_Section 9.4(d)_, nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto,
as applicable, from any liability or damages (which the parties acknowledge
and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket fees, costs
or expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby)
resulting from any knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
remedies available at law or in equity. In addition to the foregoing, no
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreements or the Limited Guaranties,
all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms.

9.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 9.4_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer and/or the Merger is
consummated. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ (other than a circumstance when a
Termination Fee is paid pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)(iv)_), then the Company
shall pay to Parent all of the reasonable and documented Expenses of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Guarantors up to, but not exceeding, Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate. As used herein, "Expenses" means all
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, financial advisors and investment bankers to a party hereto and
its Affiliates), incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, the filing of any required notices under
applicable Antitrust Laws or other regulations and all other matters related
to the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-74- (b) _Company Payments_.

 

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) (the
"Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business
Days after demand by Parent, in the event that: (A) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)_ as a
result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition prior to such
termination; (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)_ as
a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition prior to such
termination, a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly
announced or shall have become publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall
not have been withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C) within twelve (12)
months following the termination of this Agreement (the "Tail Period")
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy the
Minimum Condition prior to such termination, the Company has entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Competing Acquisition Transaction or
any Competing Acquisition Transaction has been consummated. For purposes of
this  _Section 9.4(b)(i)_ and _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_, a "Competing
Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same meaning as an "Acquisition
Transaction" except that all references therein to "more than twenty percent
(20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

(ii) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee, less any Expenses paid
pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent,
within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, in the event that: (A)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_; (B)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_, a Competing
Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly announced or shall have
become publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been withdrawn
or otherwise abandoned; and (C) during the Tail Period, the Company has
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Competing Acquisition
Transaction or any Competing Acquisition Transaction has been consummated.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

 

(iv) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(f)_ or pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_ in connection with a
breach of _Section 2.2_ (Company Actions), _Section 6.2_ (No Solicitation),
_Section 6.3_ (Rights Plan), _Section 7.3_ (Company Board Recommendation)
or  _Section 7.5_ (Anti-Takeover Laws) by the Company, the Company shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2)
Business Days after demand by Parent.

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events. 

 



-75- (d) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee, pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_, except with respect to any
act of fraud, intentional misconduct or willful breach on the Companys part,
the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of
its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement (and the termination thereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination. Without the foregoing
agreement, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement, and if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 9.4_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the payment
of any amount set forth in this _Section 9.4_, Company shall pay Parent its
costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on
such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or
such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

9.5 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ , that in the
event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement
that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under Delaware Law
without such approval.

 

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party or parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or
parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

approval of the other parties, except that each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
may assign, in Parents sole discretion, any of or all Parents and/or

among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto, the Confidentiality
Agreements, the Support Agreement and the Limited Guaranties, constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided,
however_ , the Confidentiality Agreements and the Limited Guaranties shall
not be superseded, shall survive __

 



-78-  any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and

on which the Confidentiality Agreements or the Limited Guaranties, as
applicable, expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR

THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE
BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION

TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 

10.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Section 7.8_, (b) from and after the Acceptance Time, the rights of holders
of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive

from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive consideration
pursuant to the Merger, as set forth in _Article III_.

10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

10.8 _Remedies_.

(a) Subject to _Section 9.4(b)_ and except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



-79- (b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
(or parties) under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance
of Parents obligation to cause the Financing to be funded or to fully enforce
the terms of the Commitment Letters against the Guarantors to the fullest
extent permissible thereunder and under applicable Laws, and to effect the
consummation of the Closing in accordance with _Article II_ and _Article
III_, if and only if (A) all conditions to Closing have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the
time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Financing
to be funded, and (B) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded,
then the Closing pursuant to _Article II_ and _Article III_ will occur.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. The parties hereto further
agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
10.8(b)_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other
form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section
10.8(b)_ are not available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing set
forth in this _Section 10.8(b)_ shall require any party hereto to institute
any Legal Proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any Legal
Proceeding for) specific performance under this  _Section 10.8(b)_ prior or
as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article X_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding pursuant to this  _Section 10.8(b)_ or anything set forth
in this _Section 10.8(b)_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article X_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 



-80- 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Limited Guaranties, for and on
behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with
_Section 10.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law,
and nothing in this _Section 10.10_ shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over
a particular matter, any federal or other state court within the State of
Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guaranties or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in
connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guaranties
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought, tried
and determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or
does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other
state court within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the
Limited Guaranties or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law.

10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS, THE LIMITED GUARANTIES
OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

 

10.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto agree that
the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (ii) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 



-81- 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, by email or facsimile, it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

[ _Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank_ ]

 



-82- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Agreement to be executed
by their respective duly authorized officers to be effective as of the date
first above written.

and continue to exist as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer:

 

(1) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the United States

of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger in the United States, or (ii) issued or granted any Order that is
in effect as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer and has the

inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered more than "de minimis" and such

A-2 Exhibit A

 

 _FORM OF TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT_

 

This TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February
4, 2015, is entered into by and among Eagle Parent Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Eagle Acquisition Sub, Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), and the Persons listed as
"Stockholder" on the signature page hereto (collectively, " _Stockholder_ ").
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have the meaning
given to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

 _WITNESSETH:_

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and E2open, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ")
have entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the
date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, Acquisition Sub will commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") for
each of the issued and outstanding Company Shares (as defined below) of the
Company for $8.60 in cash per share (the " _Offer Price_ "), and following
completion of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") as a result of which all of the then-outstanding
Company Shares, and all rights to purchase or otherwise acquire any Company
Shares, including Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units, not
tendered in the Offer will be canceled and converted into the right to receive
payment as set out in the Merger Agreement, and following the Merger of the
Company with the Merger Sub, the Company will thereupon become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder is the Beneficial Owner (as
defined below) of the Company Shares set forth on the signature page of this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents and Acquisition Subs
willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has requested
Stockholder, and Stockholder has agreed, in its capacity as a stockholder of
the Company, to tender and vote the Subject Shares (as defined below) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration of the
mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained herein
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. _Agreement to Tender_.

 

1.1 _Tender of Shares_. Stockholder agrees to promptly (and, in any event, not
later than five (5) Business Days after commencement of the Offer and not
later than three (3) Business Days after Stockholder acquires Beneficial
Ownership of any additional Subject Shares) and validly tender, or cause to be
validly tendered into the Offer, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of the Offer and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, all of the Subject Shares
(free and clear of any Liens or restrictions, except for any applicable
restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder that would not in any event prevent
Stockholder from tendering the Subject Shares in accordance with this
Agreement or otherwise complying with Stockholders obligations under this
Agreement). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing herein shall  require Stockholder to exercise any Company Option or other equity award or
require Stockholder to purchase any Company Shares, and nothing herein shall
prohibit Stockholder from exercising any Company Option held by such
Stockholder as of the date of this Agreement.

1.2 _No Withdrawal_. Stockholder agrees not to withdraw, and not to cause or
permit to be withdrawn, any Company Shares from the Offer unless and until the
earlier to occur of (i) the expiration of the Offer without Acquisition Sub
having accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered in the Offer or (ii)
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.3_ hereof.

1.3 _Conditional Obligation_. Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that
Acquisition Subs obligation to accept for payment Company Shares tendered
into the Offer, including the Subject Shares tendered by Stockholder, is
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Offer.

2\. _Voting Agreement; Grant of Proxy_ ,

 

2.1 _Voting Agreement_. Stockholder hereby agrees that, during the Support
Period, Stockholder will not vote any Subject Shares in favor of, or consent
to, and will vote against and not consent to, the approval of any (i)
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the Company or any other extraordinary
transaction involving the Company other than the Merger, (iii) corporate
action, the consummation of which would frustrate the purposes, or prevent or
materially delay the consummation, of any of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement or (iv) other matter relating to, or in connection with,
any of the foregoing matters that would result in a breach of any obligations
or agreements of Stockholder under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall limit
the ability of Stockholder to vote its Subject Shares in its sole discretion
on any matters other than the matters set forth in the first sentence of this
_Section 2.1_.

 

2.2 _Irrevocable Proxy_. Stockholder hereby revokes (or agrees to cause to be
revoked as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the date hereof) any and all previous proxies granted
with respect to the Subject Shares. By entering into this Agreement,
Stockholder hereby grants a proxy appointing Parent as
Stockholders attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full power of substitution,
for and in Stockholders name, to vote, express consent or dissent, or
otherwise to utilize such voting power in the manner contemplated by _Section
2.1_ above as Parent or its proxy or substitute shall, in Parents sole
discretion, deem proper with respect to the Subject Shares. The proxy granted
by Stockholder pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ is irrevocable and is granted
in consideration of Parent and Acquisition Sub entering into this Agreement
and the Merger Agreement and incurring certain related fees and expenses. The
proxy granted by Stockholder shall not be exercised to vote, consent or act on
any matter except as contemplated by  _Section 2.1_ above. The proxy granted
by Stockholder shall be revoked, terminated and of no further force or effect,
automatically and without further action, upon termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 6.3_ hereof.

 



2 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder represents
and warrants to Parent that:

3.1 _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by Stockholder of
this Agreement and the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby are within the powers of Stockholder and, if applicable,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate, company, partnership or
other action. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement
of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
similar law affecting creditors rights generally, to rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies, to
approval by the Company Board of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for purposes of Section 203
of the DGCL and to the federal securities laws and rules promulgated
thereunder. If this Agreement is being executed in representative or fiduciary
capacity, the Person signing this Agreement has full power and authority to
enter into and perform this Agreement.

3.2 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Stockholder of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) violate the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, or other comparable charter or organizational
documents, of Stockholder, if any, (ii) violate any Law applicable
to Stockholder or the transactions contemplated herein or in the Merger
Agreement, (iii) conflict with or violate or require any consent, approval,
notice or other action by any Person under, constitute a default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration or to a loss of any benefit to which
Stockholder is entitled under, any provision of any Contract binding on
Stockholder or any of Stockholders properties or assets, including the
Subject Shares or (iv) result in the imposition of any Lien on any asset of
Stockholder, including the Subject Shares.

 

3.3 _Ownership of Shares; Voting_. Stockholder is, or will be, as applicable,
the Beneficial Owner of the Subject Shares, free and clear of any Lien and
any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote or otherwise dispose of the Subject Shares), except for (i) any
restrictions provided herein and (ii) any applicable restrictions on transfer
under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
that would not in any event prevent Stockholder from tendering the Subject
Shares in accordance with this Agreement or otherwise complying with
Stockholders obligations under this Agreement. Stockholder has, or will have
control over the Person who has, sole voting power, sole power of disposition,
sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth herein,
and full power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in
each case with respect to all of the Subject Shares. For purposes of this
Agreement, "control", as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

 

3.4 _Total Shares_. Except for (x) the Subject Shares and (y) the Company
Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units set forth opposite
Stockholders name in Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter, if any,
Stockholder does not Beneficially Own any (i) shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company or (ii) options, warrants or other rights to
acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for (in each case,
whether currently, upon lapse of time, following the satisfaction of any
conditions, upon the occurrence of any event or any combination of the
foregoing), any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company.

 



3 3.5 _Finder s Fees_. No investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary is entitled to a fee or commission from Parent, Acquisition Sub
or the Company in respect of this Agreement based upon any Contract made by or
on behalf of Stockholder solely in Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of
the Company.

 

3.6 _No Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal
Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Stockholder, threatened against
Stockholder that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of
Stockholder to perform Stockholders obligations hereunder or consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub_. Parent and
Acquisition Sub represent and warrant to Stockholder:

 

4.1 _Corporation Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Acquisition Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the
limited liability company powers of Parent and the corporate powers of
Acquisition Sub and have been duly authorized by all necessary company
or corporate action, respectively. This Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Parent
and Acquisition Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar law affecting
creditors rights generally and to rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

 

5\. _Covenants of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that:

 

5.1 _No Proxies for, Encumbrances on or Disposition of Shares; Transfer of
Voting Rights_. During the Support Period, except pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, Stockholder shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, directly or indirectly, (a) grant any proxies, or enter into any
voting trust or other Contract, with respect to the voting of any Subject
Shares, (b) sell, assign, transfer, tender, encumber or otherwise dispose of,
or enter into any Contract with respect to the direct or indirect sale,
assignment, transfer, tender, encumbrance or other disposition of, any Subject
Shares, or (c) take any other action that would make any representation or
warranty of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material
respect or in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of
Stockholders obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby
or by the Merger Agreement, or seek to do or solicit any of the foregoing
actions, or cause or permit any other Person to take any of the foregoing
actions and, other than matters regarding which the Company has already
notified Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, agrees to notify Parent and
Acquisition Sub promptly, and to provide all details reasonably requested by
Parent or Acquisition Sub, if Stockholder shall be approached or solicited,
directly or indirectly, by any Person with respect to any of the foregoing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Support Period,
Stockholder shall not tender, agree to tender or cause or permit to
be tendered any Subject Shares into or otherwise in connection with any
tender or exchange offer, except pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Stockholder may transfer Subject Shares to (i) any affiliate, 

 



4  stockholder, member or partner of Stockholder or (ii) immediate family
members or a trust for the benefit of Stockholder; provided that a transfer
referred to in this sentence shall be permitted only if, as a precondition to
such transfer, the transferee agrees in a written Contract, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Parent, to be bound by all of the terms
of this Agreement. During the Support Period, Stockholder shall not deposit,
or permit the deposit of, any Subject Shares in a voting trust, grant any
proxy in respect of any Subject Shares, or enter into any voting or similar
Contract in contravention of the obligations of such Stockholder under
this Agreement with respect to any of the Subject Shares.

5.2 _Other Offers_. Neither Stockholder (in Stockholders capacity as such),
nor any of Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, shall, nor shall Stockholder or
any of Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, authorize or permit any of its or
their respective Representatives to, and Stockholder shall instruct,
and cause each applicable Subsidiary of Stockholder to instruct, each such
Representative not to, directly or indirectly, take any of the following
actions: (i) solicit, initiate, cause or induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or
any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person
(other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition
Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage, facilitate or
assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) enter into any Contract
contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any Subsidiary of Stockholder or Representatives of
Stockholder or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.2 by Stockholder. Stockholder shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to immediately cease
any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Unless the
Company has already notified Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Stockholder shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day)
notify Parent if it becomes aware of any receipt by Stockholder, its
Subsidiaries or Representatives of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry (and shall include with such notice copies of any written
materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such
Acquisition Proposal). Unless the Company has already notified Parent pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, Stockholder shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal known to
Stockholder, request or inquiry (and Stockholder shall provide Parent with
copies of any additional written materials received by it that relate to such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by Stockholder (or any
affiliated officer or director of the Company) in compliance with the Merger
Agreement, including taking any of the foregoing actions that would be
permitted to be taken by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

 



5 5.3 _Communications_. During the Support Period, Stockholder, and each of
Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, shall not, and shall cause their
respective officers, directors, employees or other Representatives, if any,
not to, directly or indirectly, make any press release, public announcement or
other public communication that criticizes or disparages this Agreement or
the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, without the prior written consent of Parent, provided that the
foregoing shall not limit or affect any actions taken by Stockholder (or any
affiliated officer or director of the Company) in compliance with the Merger
Agreement, including taking any of the foregoing actions that would be
permitted to be taken by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement
(including in respect of a Board Recommendation Change made pursuant to the
Merger Agreement). Stockholder hereby (i) consents to and authorizes the
publication and disclosure by Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
(including in the Schedule TO, the Schedule 14D-9 or any other publicly filed
documents relating to the Merger, the Offer or any other transaction
contemplated by the Merger Agreement) of: (a) Stockholders identity; (b)
Stockholders Beneficial Ownership of the Subject Shares; and (c) the nature
of Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement, and any other information that Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company determines to be necessary in any SEC disclosure document in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) agrees as promptly as
practicable to notify Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company of any required
corrections with respect to any written information supplied by Stockholder
specifically for use in any such disclosure document. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by
Stockholder (or any affiliated officer or director of the Company) in
compliance with the Merger Agreement.

5.4 _Additional Shares_. In the event that Stockholder acquires Beneficial
Ownership of, or the power to dispose of or vote or direct the disposition or
voting of, any additional Company Shares or other interests in or with respect
to the Company, such Company Shares or other interests shall, without
further action of the parties, be subject to the provisions of this Agreement
and deemed "Subject Shares", and the number of Subject Shares set forth on the
signature page hereto will be deemed amended accordingly. Stockholder shall
promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub of any such event.

5.5 _Waiver of Appraisal and Dissenters  Rights and Actions_.
Stockholder hereby (i) waives and agrees not to exercise any rights
(including under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware) to demand appraisal of any Subject Shares or rights to dissent from
the Merger which may arise with respect to the Merger and (ii) agrees not to
commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or other
Legal Proceeding, against Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any of
their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery
of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the making or consummation of the
Offer or consummation of the Merger, including any Legal Proceeding (x)
challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of, any
provision of this Agreement or (y) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of
the Company Board in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.

 



6 5.6 _Certain Restrictions_. Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
take any action that would make any representation or warranty of Stockholder
contained herein untrue or incorrect.

6\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

6.1 _Other Definitional and Interpretative Provisions_. The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in this Agreement
shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement. The captions herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof. References to Sections are to Sections of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include the plural, and any plural term the singular. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation," whether or
not they are in fact followed by those words or words of like import. The
word "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or."
"Writing," "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing and other
means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible form.
References to any Contract (including the Merger Agreement) are to that
Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References from or through
any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and
including, respectively.

 

6.2 _Further Assurances_. Stockholder shall, to the extent requested by
Parent, promptly: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each other
Person having voting power with respect to any Subject Shares to execute and
deliver to Parent a proxy with respect to such shares, which shall be
identical to the proxy in _Section 2.2_ above; and (ii) upon
request, surrender the certificates representing the Subject Shares, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to request the certificates representing any
other outstanding Subject Shares, to be surrendered so that the transfer agent
for such shares may affix thereto an appropriate legend referring to this
Agreement.

6.3 _Amendments; Termination_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
This Agreement shall terminate upon the termination or expiration of the
Support Period; provided, however, that no termination of this Agreement shall
relieve any party hereto from any liability for any knowing and intentional
breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to such termination.

6.4 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

6.5 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that Stockholder may not assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of Stockholders rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent. Any
assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall be null
and void.

 



7 6.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 

6.7 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. Signatures
to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
PDF form or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto
and the Merger Agreement has become effective. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto and the Merger
Agreement has become effective, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication).

 

6.8 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

6.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
to Parent or Acquisition Sub would occur, damages would be incalculable and
would be an insufficient remedy and no other adequate remedy would exist at
law or in equity, in each case in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed by Stockholder in accordance with the terms
hereof, and that each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically Stockholders performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which Parent or Acquisition Sub may be
entitled at law or in equity. Stockholder hereby waives any defenses based on
the adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might be
asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any of the terms
or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by
Parent or Acquisition Sub.

 

6.10 _Defined Terms_. For the purposes of this Agreement:

 

(a) Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 



8 (b) Stockholder shall be deemed to " _Beneficially Own_ " or to have
acquired " _Beneficial Ownership_ " of a security if Stockholder (a) is the
record owner of such security; or (b) is the "beneficial owner" with respect
to the investment authority of such security (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of such security.

(c) "Company Shares" shall mean shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company.

(d) "Subject Shares" shall mean any Company Shares that are owned, or
hereafter acquired (including through the exercise or settlement of Company
Options or Company Restricted Stock Units), by the Stockholder, or for which
the Stockholder otherwise becomes the record or beneficial owner (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), prior to the end of the Support
Period.

(e) "Support Period" shall mean the period from the date of this Agreement
through the earlier of (i) the date upon which the Merger Agreement is
validly terminated, (ii) the Effective Time, and (iii) an amendment to the
Merger Agreement that decreases, or changes the form of, the consideration to
be received in the Offer or the Merger.

6.11 _Action in Stockholder s Capacity Only_. Stockholder, if a director or
officer of the Company, does not make any agreement or understanding herein
as a director or officer of the Company. Stockholder signs this Agreement
solely in Stockholders capacity as a Beneficial Owner of the Subject Shares,
and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken in Stockholders
capacity as an officer or director of the Company, including complying with or
exercising such Stockholders fiduciary duties as a member of the Company
Board.

writing and shall be deemed to have been duly delivered and received
hereunder (i) four (4) Business Days after being sent by registered or

Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in

within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as
provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

6.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

 



10  PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

6.16 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of

remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. A party hereto shall not be deemed to

waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

6.17 _No Ownership Interest_. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of
and relating to the Subject Shares at a given time shall remain vested in and
belong to Stockholder as of such time, and Parent shall have no authority to
exercise any power or authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of
the Subject Shares, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, or in
the performance of Stockholders duties or responsibilities as a stockholder
of the Company.
