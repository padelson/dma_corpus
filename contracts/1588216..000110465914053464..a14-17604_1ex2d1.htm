earned with respect to the Assets at or after the Effective Time, and (B)

by Adventure in the ordinary course of business consistent with Adventures
past practice and such standards. For purposes of allocating production (and

liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into
the storage facilities into which they are transported from the lands covered
by the applicable Lease, Unit or Well, or if there are no storage facilities,
when they pass through the LACT meter or similar meter at the entry point into
the pipelines through which they are transported from such lands and (ii)
gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the delivery point sales meters
or similar meters at the entry point into the pipelines through which they are

procedures to arrive at an

 



      
 

 



 

allocation of production when exact meter readings (including gas production
meters or sales meters) or gauging and strapping data is not available.

 



 

(c) As used herein, " **Property Costs** " means (i) all costs attributable to
the ownership or operation of the Assets (including prepaid costs or deposits,
costs of insurance, and ad valorem, property, severance, production and
similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the
Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding any other
Taxes), (ii) capital expenditures incurred in the ownership or operation of
the Assets in the ordinary course of business, (iii) where applicable, such
costs and capital expenditures charged in accordance with the relevant
operating agreement, unit agreement, pooling agreement, pre-pooling agreement,
pooling order or similar instrument, or if none, charged to the Assets on the
same basis as charged on the date of this Agreement, (iv) overhead costs
charged to the Assets under the relevant operating agreement, unit agreement,
pooling agreement, pre-pooling agreement, pooling order or similar instrument
by unaffiliated third parties, or if none, charged to the Assets on the same
basis as charged on the date of this Agreement and (v) in addition to the
foregoing items, with respect to Adventure Operated Assets during the
Adjustment Period, payment to Adventure of $25,000.00 per month (prorated for
any partial months as applicable); _provided_ that "Property Costs" shall
exclude, without limitation, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses
attributable to (i) claims, investigations, Proceedings or litigation directly
or indirectly arising out of or resulting from actual or claimed personal
injury or death, property damage or violation of any Law (including private
rights or causes of action under any Law), (ii) title claims (including claims
that the Leases have terminated), (iii) obligations to plug wells, dismantle
facilities, close pits and restore the surface or seabed around such wells,
facilities and pits, (iv) obligations to cure, address or remediate any
contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil or Equipment under
applicable Environmental Laws, (v) obligations to furnish make-up gas
according to the terms of applicable gas sales, gathering or transportation
contracts, (vi) gas balancing obligations and similar obligations arising from
Imbalances, and (vii) obligations to pay working interests, royalties,
overriding royalties or other interests held in suspense, all of which are
addressed in Section 11.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement. For the purposes of
calculating the adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2 or
implementing the terms of Section 7.8 or Article 11, ad valorem, property and
similar Taxes, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and Property Costs
(excluding delay rentals, lease bonuses, minimum royalties, option payments,
lease extension payments and shut-in royalties) that are paid periodically
shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling
before, or at and after, the Effective Time, except that production, severance
and similar Taxes shall be prorated based on the number of units actually
produced, purchased or sold or proceeds of sale, as applicable, before, or at
and after, the Effective Time. Subject to the preceding sentence,
determination of whether Property Costs are attributable to the period before
or after the Effective Time shall be based on when services are rendered, when
goods are delivered, or when the work is performed.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.5 **_Delivery and Maintenance of Records_**.

 



 

(a) Each Seller, at Purchasers cost, shall use reasonable efforts to deliver
the Records in such Sellers possession or control (FOB such Sellers office)
to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days following Closing. Such Seller may
retain copies of any Records delivered by such Seller.

 



 

(b) Purchaser, for a period of four (4) years following the Closing, will (i)
retain the Records, (ii) provide each Seller, its Affiliates, and its and
their officers, employees and representatives with access to the Records
during normal business hours for review and copying at such Sellers expense
and (iii) within five (5) Business Days of receipt of written notice from a
Seller, provide such Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers,
employees, consultants and legal counsel with access, during normal business
hours, to materials received or produced after Closing relating to any claim
for indemnification made under Section 11.2 (excluding, however, (x) attorney
work product and communications protected by attorney-client privilege and
prepared with respect to any such claim being brought by Purchaser and (y)
information subject to an applicable confidentiality restriction in favor of
third Persons) for review and copying at such Sellers expense.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 2_**

 



 

 ** _PURCHASE PRICE_**

 



 

Section 2.1 **_Purchase Price_**.

 



 

The purchase price for the Assets (the " **Purchase Price** ") shall be Two
Hundred Forty-Nine Million Eight Hundred Seventy-Nine Thousand Dollars
($249,879,000), and shall be adjusted as provided in Section 2.2 and Section
9.4 (the " **Adjusted Purchase Price** ").

 



 

Section 2.2 **_Adjustments to Purchase Price_**.

 



 

The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all such
amounts being determined in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, as
applied by Adventure in the ordinary course of business consistent with
Adventures past practice and such standards (with such adjustments being made
so as to not give duplicative effect):

 



 

(a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received and
retained by any Seller between the Effective Time and the Closing Date (with
the period between the Effective Time and the Closing Date referred to as the
" **Adjustment Period** "): proceeds earned from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net
of any royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of
production, gathering, processing and transportation costs and any production,
severance, sales, excise or similar Taxes that are paid by such Seller and not
reimbursed to such Seller by the purchaser of production) produced from or
attributable to the Properties during the Adjustment Period;

 



 

(b) Reduced in accordance with Section 3.5 or Section 7.7, by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of those Properties (i) with respect to which
preferential

 



      
 

 



 

purchase rights have been exercised prior to Closing or remain outstanding as
of Closing, or (ii) that cannot be transferred due to unsatisfied and unwaived
Consent Requirements;

 



 

(c) Reduced in accordance with Section 7.7 by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of those Properties that are subject to a Proceeding prior to Closing
seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce
preferential rights;

 



 

(d) (i) Subject to Section 3.4(i), reduced by the applicable Title Defect
Amount as a result of Title Defects for which the Title Defect Amount has been
finally determined or agreed pursuant to Section 3.4 (or, for purposes of the
Closing Payment, pursuant to Sellers good faith estimate), and by the
Allocated Value (or applicable portion thereof) of any Title Defect Property
retained by Sellers pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(ii) and (ii) subject to Section
3.4(e), increased by the applicable Title Benefit Amount as a result of Title
Benefits for which the Title Benefit Amount has been finally determined or
agreed pursuant to Section 3.4;

 



 

(e) Reduced by the Allocated Values (or the applicable portions of the
Allocated Values) of any Properties excluded by Sellers pursuant to Section
3.4(c) or Section 3.6;

 



 

(f) Subject to Section 4.4, reduced by (i) the applicable Environmental Defect
Amount as a result of Environmental Defects for which Sellers made an election
under Section 4.4(a)(i) and the Environmental Defect Amount has been finally
determined or agreed pursuant to Section 4.4 (or, for purposes of the Closing
Payment, pursuant to Sellers good faith estimate), and (ii) the Allocated
Value of any Property retained by Sellers pursuant to Section 4.4(a) or
Section 4.4(b);

 



 

(g) Increased by the amount equal to the value of all of Sellers inventories
of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties that are in
storage in tanks or pipelines above the load line or pipeline connection, as
applicable, as of the Effective Time (which value shall be computed using the
price received for May sales as of May 31, 2014, net of any royalties,
overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of production,
gathering, processing and transportation costs and any production, severance,
sales or excise Taxes that are paid by a Seller and not reimbursed to such
Seller by the purchaser of production), less any applicable production,
severance, sales or excise Taxes, royalties and similar burdens; _provided,
however_ , that the adjustment contemplated by this paragraph shall be only
made to the extent that a Seller does not receive and retain the proceeds, or
portion thereof, attributable to the sale of such Hydrocarbons;

 



 

(h) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs attributable
to the ownership and operation of the Assets that are paid by a Seller and
incurred on or after the Effective Time, including pre-paid costs and
deposits, except any Property Costs and other such costs already deducted in
the determination of proceeds in Section 2.2(a);

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Increased by an amount equal to the value, as determined according to the
COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures, of all surplus tubular, goods and physical
inventory (including water) to the extent such items are owned by a Seller and
included in the Assets at the Effective Time; and

 



 

(j) Decreased in accordance with Section 7.10, as applicable.

 



 

The adjustment described in Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the
amount of the adjustment, Purchasers entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during the
Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and
Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or
income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has
been made.

 



 

The adjustment described in Section 2.2(h) shall serve to satisfy, up to the
amount of the adjustment, Purchasers responsibility under Section 1.4 for
Property Costs during the Adjustment Period, and Purchaser shall not have any
separate obligations for Property Costs with respect to which an adjustment
has been made.

 



 

Section 2.3 **_Allocation of Purchase Price_**.

 



 

On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser and Sellers will agree upon an
allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets, in compliance
with the principles of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " **Code** "), and the United States Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Such allocation shall be consistent with the Allocated Values set
forth in Schedule 2.3 (including the allocation among Sellers set forth
therein). The " **Allocated Value** " for any Asset equals the portion of the
unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Schedule 2.3, increased
or decreased as described in Section 2.2. Any adjustments to the Purchase
Price other than the adjustments provided for in Sections 2.2(b), 2.2(c),
2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.2(f) shall be applied on a pro rata basis in proportion
to the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.3 for all Assets. After all such
adjustments are made, any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Sections 2.2(b), 2.2(c), 2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.2(f) shall be applied to the
amounts set forth in Schedule 2.3 for the particular affected Assets. After
Sellers and Purchaser have agreed on the Allocated Values for the Assets,
Sellers will be deemed to have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise make no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values. Sellers and
Purchaser agree (i) that the Allocated Values, as adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph, shall be used by Sellers and Purchaser as the basis for reporting
asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax
Returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) that neither
they nor their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the Allocated
Values (as adjusted pursuant to this paragraph) in notices to Governmental
Bodies, in audit or other Proceedings with respect to Taxes, in notices to
preferential purchase right holders, or in other documents or notices relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the
other Party. Purchaser and Sellers further agree that, on or before the
Closing Date, they will mutually agree as to the further allocation of the
Allocated Values included in Schedule 2.3 as to the relative portion of those
values attributable to leasehold costs and depreciable equipment.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.4 **_Deposit_**.

 



 

Not later than the second Business Day after the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall pay to Bank of Texas, N.A. as escrow agent (the " **Escrow
Agent** "), a deposit in the amount of five percent (5%) of the unadjusted
Purchase Price (together with any interest or other earnings thereon, the "
**Deposit** "). In connection with the Deposit, Purchaser, the Sellers
Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter in an agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (the " **Escrow Agreement** "). In the event
Purchaser fails to timely make the Deposit in accordance with this Section
2.4, Sellers shall have the option to terminate this Agreement immediately by
delivering written notice to Purchaser of Sellers election to so terminate,
after which time the provisions of Section 10.2 shall apply; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding such termination, Sellers shall retain and be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law or in equity against
Purchaser in connection with Purchasers failure to perform its obligations
under this Section 2.4.

 



 

In the event the Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be credited against the
Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser at Closing and retained in the escrow
account established with Escrow Agent to satisfy (but not serve as a cap or
other limitation of) amounts that may be owed by Sellers to Purchaser with
respect to the indemnities of Sellers under this Agreement. Such amount
retained in the escrow account following the Closing, together with any
interest and earnings thereon, shall be referred to as the " **Indemnity
Escrow**."

(i) defects based solely on a lack of information in any Sellers files or
references to a document if such document is not in any Sellers files;

marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or estate

 



      
 

 



 

Proceedings, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such failure
or omission could reasonably be expected to result in another Persons
superior claim of title to the relevant Asset;

 



 

(iv) defects based on a gap in any Sellers chain of title unless such gap is
affirmatively shown to exist after a review of the available public and/or
county records and the Records, by an abstract of title, title opinion or

Notice);

 



 

(v) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitation or

the following:

by appropriate actions, such contested actions being reflected in Schedule
3.3(f);

 



 

(g) All rights to consent, required notices to, filings with, or other actions
by Governmental Bodies in connection with the sale or conveyance of the Assets
if they are not required prior to the sale or conveyance or are of a type
customarily obtained after Closing; provided such Governmental Body is,

(n) Imbalances associated with the Assets;

 



 

(o) Any liens, charges, encumbrances, defects or irregularities in the

operating agreements, farm-out agreements, leases and assignments, contracts
for purchases of Hydrocarbons or similar

 



      
 

 



 

Contracts or Surface Rights, or otherwise in the ordinary course of business)
that are of a nature customarily accepted by prudent purchasers of oil and gas
properties and do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce Sellers Net
Revenue Interest below that shown in Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3
(as applicable) or increase Sellers Working Interest above that shown in
Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3 (as applicable) without a corresponding
increase in Net Revenue Interest; and

 



 

(p) any Title Defects arising from the failure of Sellers to own the Endeavor

Section 3.4 **_Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) To assert a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim notices to Sellers
(each a " **Title Defect Notice** ") on or before the day that is seven (7)
Business Days before the Scheduled Closing Date (the " **Title Claim Date**
"), except as otherwise provided under Section 3.5 or Section 3.6. Each Title
Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Subject Property (or portion thereof)
affected by the Title Defect (each a " **Title Defect Property** "), (iii) the
Allocated Values of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Sellers (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by any Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s)
and (v) Purchasers reasonable estimate of the Title Defect Amount and the
computations and information upon which Purchasers estimate is based.
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived for all purposes under this Article 3
(and, for clarity, not for purposes of the Special Warranty in the Conveyance
(subject to and except as provided in Section 7.9 and Section 7.3)) all Title
Defects that were not included in a Title Defect Notice delivered to Sellers
on or before the Title Claim Date. The failure of a Title Defect Notice to
contain item nos. 3.4(a)(i) through (v) shall not render such notice void and
ineffective if it materially complies with the provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) Each Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser with respect to each Title Benefit a written notice (a " **Title
Benefit Notice** ") asserting such Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date. Each Title Benefit Notice shall include (i) a description of the Title
Benefit(s), (ii) the Subject Property affected by the Title Benefit (each a "
**Title Benefit Property** "), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Title Benefit
Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser (as
well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser) to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Benefit(s) and (v) such Sellers estimate of
the Title Benefit Amount, and the computations and information upon which such
Sellers estimate is based. Sellers shall be deemed to have waived for all
purposes hereunder all Title Benefits that were not included in a Title
Benefit Notice delivered to Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date. The
failure of a Title Benefit Notice to contain item nos. 3.4(b)(i) through (v)
shall not render such notice void and ineffective if it materially complies
with the provisions hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Cure Right.

 



 

Each Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon delivering
written notice to Purchaser, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove
any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Purchaser on or before the
expiration of ninety (90) days counted from and after the Title Claim Date
(the " **Cure Period** "), unless the Parties otherwise agree. If a Seller has
provided notice at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date of such
Sellers intent to attempt to cure a Title Defect within the Cure Period: (i)
the Title Defect Property affected thereby shall be excluded from the Assets
at the Closing, and (ii) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value thereof (proportionately reduced if the underlying Subject Property is
only partially affected) for purposes of Closing. If at the end of the Cure
Period (x) the Title Defect is cured as agreed by Sellers and Purchaser or (y)
if Sellers and Purchaser cannot agree, and it is determined by the Title
Arbitrator that such Title Defect is cured as of the end of the Cure Period,
then, within five (5) Business Days thereafter, (I) Sellers shall assign to
Purchaser using substantially the same form as the Conveyance each Title
Defect Property with respect to which Title Defects were cured and (II) the
Parties shall account to one another as if such Title Defect Property had been
conveyed at Closing. No action of a Seller in electing or attempting to cure a
Title Defect shall constitute a waiver of such Sellers right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect.

 



 

(d) Remedies for Title Defects.

 



 

In the event that (i) any Title Defect asserted by Purchaser in accordance
with Section 3.4(a) is not waived by Purchaser and (ii) no Seller has provided
notice to Purchaser at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date of its
intent to attempt to cure the given Title Defect, then Sellers shall, at their
sole joint election, elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant
to Section 3.4(f) or 3.4(h);

 



 

(ii) retain the Title Defect Property, in which event the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value thereof (proportionately
reduced if the underlying Subject Property is only partially affected); or

 



 

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10.

 



 

In the event Sellers elect to retain a Property subject to a Title Defect and
revenue has regularly been paid to a Seller with respect thereto without
written complaint for a period in excess of three (3) years, then Purchaser
agrees, except as required by Law (i) not to take any action to interfere with
such revenue stream to such Seller, its successors and assigns (including by
causing such interest to be put in suspense), and (ii) to the extent that
Purchaser becomes payor of such revenue, to pay such Seller such revenue upon
receipt of a reasonable indemnity agreement from such Seller.

 



 

(e) Remedies for Title Benefits.

 



 

In the event that any Title Benefit asserted by a Seller in accordance with
Section 3.4(b) is not waived by such Seller, then:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) to the extent Purchaser and such Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount
as calculated pursuant to Section 3.4(g), the Purchase Price shall be
increased by such amount; and

 



 

(ii) to the extent there is no agreement under Section 3.4(e)(i) on or before
the Closing Date, the disagreement between such Seller and Purchaser regarding
the Title Benefit Property or the Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, shall
be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 3.4(h).

 



 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Price
may only be adjusted with respect to one or more Title Benefits to the extent
that the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(i) on account
of one or more Title Defects.

 



 

(f) The " **Title Defect Amount** " resulting from a Title Defect shall be
determined as follows:

 



 

(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
on Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3 (as applicable), then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual amount
of the decrease in Net Revenue Interest from that stated on Exhibit A, Exhibit
A-1 or Schedule 2.3 (as applicable) and the denominator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3 (as
applicable); _provided, however_ , that if the Title Defect does not affect
the Title Defect Property throughout its entire life, the Title Defect Amount
shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period only;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by
the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic
effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the
values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and such other
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents (1) a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest

 



      
 

 



 

stated on Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3 (as applicable), and/or (2)
an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to
the Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by
applying subsections (ii), (iii) and (iv) to such Title Defect, provided there
shall be no duplication of Title Defect Amounts affecting a Title Defect
Property; and

 



 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3 but excluding
Title Defects described in subsection (ii), the aggregate Title Defect Amounts
attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect
Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.

 



 

(g) The " **Title Benefit Amount** " resulting from a Title Benefit shall be
the product of the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual amount of the increase in Net
Revenue Interest from that stated on Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3
(as applicable) and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
stated on Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1 or Schedule 2.3 (as applicable); _provided,
however_ , that if the Title Benefit does not affect the applicable Title
Benefit Property throughout its entire life, the Title Benefit Amount shall be
reduced to take into account the applicable time period only.

 



 

(h) With respect to Title Defect Notices and Title Benefit Notices provided
and received on or before the Title Claim Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall
attempt to agree on all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts on or before the Closing Date, subject to Sellers
rights under Sections 3.4(d)(ii) and 3.4(d)(iii). If Sellers and Purchaser are
unable to agree by that date, then subject to Section 3.4(c) and Sellers
rights under Sections 3.4(d)(ii) and 3.4(d)(iii), Sellers good faith estimate
shall be used for purposes of calculating the Closing Payment pursuant to
Section 9.4(a), and the Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved
by arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.4(h). Likewise, if a Seller has
provided notice at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date of such
Sellers intent to attempt to cure a Title Defect and by the end of the Cure
Period, Sellers and Purchaser have been unable to agree upon whether such
Title Defect has been cured, or a Seller has failed to cure any Title Defects
which such Seller provided notice that such Seller would attempt to cure and
such Seller and Purchaser have been unable to agree on the Title Defect
Amounts for such Title Defects, then the cure and/or Title Defect Amounts in
dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to
this Section 3.4(h). There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title
attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles in the
State of Texas as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Sellers within
fifteen (15) days after the end of the Cure Period (or such other time as
mutually agreed). Absent such agreement on the selection of the arbitrator,
the arbitrator shall be selected by the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " **Title Arbitrator** "). The Title Arbitrator
shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for either Party or
its Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or
have any financial interest in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall
be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in English and in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,
to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both
Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 3.4 and may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title
Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise
the arbitrator, including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts,
as applicable, submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest
or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear
its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Sellers shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, and Purchaser
shall bear one-half of such costs and expenses.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Sellers for any individual Title Defect (excluding a Lease Expiration Defect
or a matter that would constitute a breach of the Special Warranty) for which
the Title Defect Amount does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the
" **Individual Defect Threshold** "); and (y) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for
Title Defects (excluding Lease Expiration Defects and a matter that would
constitute a breach of the Special Warranty) unless the aggregate amount of
all Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects covered by Section 3.4(d)(i) that
exceed the Individual Defect Threshold (minus the amount of any Title Benefit
Amounts), exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the
Purchase Price (the " **Title Defect Deductible** "), after which point
Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
available remedies under this Article 3 with respect to all Title Defects in
excess of the Title Defect Deductible, subject to the Individual Defect
Threshold and Sellers elections under Section 3.4(d). The provisions of this
Section 3.4(i) shall not apply to Title Defects relating to consent to
assignment and preferential rights to purchase which shall be handled or
treated under Section 3.5 and Section 7.7. The Title Defect Amount of any
Title Defect Property retained by Sellers in accordance with Section
3.4(d)(ii) may be used in meeting the Title Defect Deductible.

 



 

(j) The Parties acknowledge that Adventure is engaged in efforts to acquire
the Samson Interest. In the event Adventure acquires Defensible Title to the
Samson Interest on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Samson Interest shall be deemed included in the Assets and, within ten (10)
Business Days after Adventure provides notice of such acquisition to Purchaser
(including evidence of the acquisition), shall be assigned to Purchaser using
the form of Conveyance (provided the effective time shall be the date of
assignment), and Purchaser shall contemporaneously pay to Adventure by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to Twelve Million
Dollars ($12,000,000). If Adventure acquires only partial Defensible Title to
the Samson Interest, the aforementioned payment shall be reduced in the same
manner as provided in the definition of "Title Defect Amount." As applied to
the Samson Interest in this Section 3.4(j) only, the represented Working
Interest and/or Net Revenue Interest in

 



      
 

 



 

the definition of Defensible Title shall be as set forth on Schedule 3.4(j).
If the Parties cannot agree on whether Adventure has acquired Defensible Title
to the Samson Interest pursuant to this Section 3.4(j) by the date that is ten
(10) Business Days after Adventures notice is delivered, then such
disagreement shall be promptly referred to a Title Arbitrator for a final
resolution in the same manner as provided in Section 3.4(h).

 



 

Section 3.5 **_Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase_**.

 



 

Each Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and
send (i) notices to the third Person holders (excluding Governmental Bodies,
which are addressed elsewhere in this Agreement) of any consents to assignment
of any Assets in which such Seller holds an interest requesting applicable
consents and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights
to purchase any Asset in which such Seller owns an interest requesting waivers
of such preferential rights to purchase, in each case that would be triggered
by the purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement, and of which any
Seller has knowledge as set forth on Schedule 5.15 (such consents and
preferential rights, " **Known Preferential Rights and Consents** "). The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Assets for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Assets (proportionately reduced if an Asset is only partially
affected). Each Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy or
obtain waivers of, as applicable, Known Preferential Rights and Consents to
which its interests in the Assets are subject, provided that each such Seller
is not required to make a payment or give other consideration in order to
obtain any Consents or waiver of any Known Preferential Rights. Purchaser
shall cooperate with Sellers in seeking to satisfy or obtain waivers of, as
applicable, Known Preferential Rights and Consents. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, no Seller shall have any liability for
failure to either send notices for, or to satisfy and/or obtain waivers of,
Known Preferential Rights and Consents so long as such Seller has used
commercially reasonable efforts in connection therewith.

 



 

(a) _Consents_. Each Seller shall notify Purchaser prior to Closing of all
Known Preferential Rights and Consents to which its interests in the Assets
are subject that have not been waived or granted, as applicable, or that have
been exercised in the case of preferential rights to purchase, and the Assets
to which they pertain. In no event shall there be included in the Conveyances
at Closing any Asset subject to an unsatisfied consent requirement that would
be triggered by the purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement and
provides that transfer of the Asset without consent will cause the transfer to
be void or result in (i) a termination or other material impairment of any
existing rights in relation to such Asset or (ii) the payment of liquidated
damages absent the consent (such consent requirement, a " **Consent
Requirement** "). In cases where the Asset subject to a Consent Requirement is
a Contract or Surface Right and Purchaser is assigned the Properties to which
the Contract or Surface Right relates, but the Contract or Surface Right is
not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Consent Requirement, each
Seller that owned interests in the Assets subject thereto shall continue after
Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable
consent so that the right, title and interest of such Seller(s) in such
Contract or Surface Right can be transferred to Purchaser upon the receipt of
such consent. In cases where the Asset subject to a Consent Requirement is a
Property and the third Person consent to the sale and transfer of

 



       
 

 



 

such Property is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may
elect to treat the unsatisfied Consent Requirement as a Title Defect by giving
Sellers notice thereof in accordance with Section 3.4(a), except that such
notice may be given on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , the
Title Defect Amount for such Property may not be used in meeting the Title
Defect Deductible, and a Seller may elect to cure such unsatisfied Consent
Requirement under Section 3.4(c), in which event the provisions of Section
3.4(c) shall apply, _provided further_ that the affected Asset shall be
excluded from the Assets for purposes of Closing until the Consent Requirement
is waived or satisfied (unless otherwise agreed by Sellers and Purchaser). In
cases where an Asset is subject to a third Person consent requirement that is
not a Consent Requirement, the Asset shall be included in the Assets at
Closing (unless excluded pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement)
and Purchaser shall be responsible after Closing for satisfying such consent
requirement at its sole cost, risk and expense, to the extent the applicable
consent was not obtained or waived on or prior to Closing. If an unsatisfied
Consent Requirement for which a Purchase Price adjustment is made at Closing
is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final determination of the
Final Settlement Statement (the " **Final Settlement Date** "), Sellers shall
receive an additional upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in the Final
Settlement Statement equal to the amount of the previous reduction in the
Purchase Price on account of the Consent Requirement and the provisions of
this Section 3.5 shall no longer apply except for the assignment made under
the next sentence. Within five (5) Business Days of the Final Settlement Date,
whether by agreement between Sellers and Purchaser or the determination of an
Independent Expert under Section 9.4(b) (or both), Sellers shall assign to
Purchaser using substantially the same form as the Conveyance, to the extent
previously unassigned, each Property subject to an aforementioned Consent
Requirement that was subsequently satisfied after Closing but prior to the
Final Settlement Date.

 



 

(b) _Exercised Preferential Rights to Purchase_. If any preferential right to
purchase any Property that would be triggered by the purchase and sale
contemplated by this Agreement is exercised prior to Closing, such Property
transferred to the exercising third Person as a result of the exercise of such
preferential right shall be excluded from the Assets for all purposes
hereunder, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced under Section 2.2(b) by the
Allocated Value for such Property (proportionately reduced if the preferential
right affects only a portion of such Property). Sellers shall retain the
consideration paid by the third Person pursuant to the exercise of such
preferential right; _provided, however_ , the adjustment made under this
Section 3.5(b) for such Property may not be used in meeting the Individual
Defect Threshold or the Title Defect Deductible. If any preferential right to
purchase any Asset is not exercised and does not expire prior to Closing, then
the terms of Section 7.7 shall apply to such right.

 



 

Section 3.6 **_Casualty or Condemnation Loss_**.

 



 

Subject to the provisions of Sections 8.1(e) and 8.2(e), if, after the
Effective Time but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is
destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right
of eminent domain (such portion of Assets, the " **Casualty Assets** "), and
the loss as a result of such individual casualty or taking exceeds One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000), Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof.
Sellers may elect

 



      
 

 



 

by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing to cause the Casualty Assets
to be repaired or restored, if such repair or restoration is reasonably
feasible, prior to Closing to at least its condition prior to the applicable
casualty, at Sellers sole cost (without an adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.2 or otherwise), as promptly as reasonably practicable
(which work may extend after the Closing Date), in which event Sellers shall
retain all of the rights to insurance and other claims against third Persons
with respect to the applicable casualty or taking except to the extent the
Parties otherwise agree in writing. In the event that Sellers do not make (or
are not able to make) such election, Purchaser may elect prior to Closing (i)
to have the Casualty Assets excluded from the Assets and have the Purchase
Price reduced by the Allocated Value of the Casualty Assets or (ii) to have
the Casualty Assets included in the Assets delivered at Closing (unless
excluded pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement) and have Sellers
assign to or subrogate Purchaser to all of Sellers right, title and interest
in and to all rights of insurance and other claims against third Persons that
arise from or by their terms cover the applicable casualty or taking. If
Purchaser makes an election under (i) of the preceding sentence, Sellers shall
retain all of the aforementioned rights to insurance and other claims against
third Persons with respect to the applicable casualty or taking except to the
extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

Section 3.7 **_Limitations on Applicability_**.

 



 

THE RIGHTS OF PURCHASER UNDER SECTION 3.1(A) AND SECTION 3.4(A) SHALL
TERMINATE AS OF THE TITLE CLAIM DATE AND BE OF NO FURTHER FORCE AND EFFECT
THEREAFTER, PROVIDED THERE SHALL BE NO TERMINATION OF PURCHASERS OR SELLERS
RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 3.4 WITH RESPECT TO ANY BONA FIDE TITLE DEFECT PROPERLY
REPORTED IN A TITLE DEFECT NOTICE OR BONA FIDE TITLE BENEFIT PROPERLY REPORTED
IN A TITLE BENEFIT NOTICE ON OR BEFORE THE TITLE CLAIM DATE. EXCEPT AS
PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 3 AND FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY IN THE CONVEYANCE
(SUBJECT TO SECTION 7.9), PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE PURCHASER
INDEMNITEES, RELEASES, REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES THE SELLER INDEMNITEES
FROM ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS,
DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST OR CAUSES OF ACTION
WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER OR ANY
PURCHASER INDEMNITEE MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO
OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT OR OTHER LIEN, ENCUMBRANCE, COVENANT,
OBLIGATION, OR DEFICIENCY AFFECTING TITLE TO ANY ASSET.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 4_**

 



 

 ** _ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 4.1 **_Assessment_**.

 



 

From and after the date hereof and up to and including the Environmental Claim
Date (or upon the earlier termination of this Agreement) but subject to (i)
applicable Laws, (ii) the limitations set forth herein and in Section 7.1, and
(iii) obtaining any required consents of third

 



      
 

 



 

Persons, including third Person operators of any Assets, Purchaser may, at its
option, cause a Phase I environmental assessment of all or any portion of the
Assets to be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering
firm selected by Purchaser and approved by Adventure (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) (the " **Environmental Consultant** ") or such
Environmental Consultant may conduct visual inspections, record reviews, and
interviews relating to the Properties, including their condition and their
compliance with Environmental Laws (the " **Assessment** "). The Assessment
shall be conducted at the sole risk, cost and expense of Purchaser, and all of
Purchasers and the Environmental Consultants activity conducted under this
Section 4.1 and Section 7.1 shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of
Section 7.6. Purchasers right of access shall not, without the prior written
consent of Adventure (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), entitle Purchaser to operate equipment or conduct
testing or sampling, it being understood that it shall be reasonable to
withhold such consent unless (i) Purchasers Environmental Consultant
reasonably believes that (in accordance with the standards of a prudent
consultant performing an ASTM Phase 1) such testing or sampling is warranted
due to a realistic likelihood of subsurface contamination that could
constitute an Environmental Defect, (ii) such Environmental Consultant
provides documentation supporting such belief, and (iii) Purchaser could be
liable under Environmental Laws for such Environmental Defect after Closing.
Each Seller has the right to be present during the Assessment. Purchaser shall
coordinate its Assessment with Adventure to minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Adventure. Purchaser, the
Environmental Consultant, and their respective agents, employees and
representatives shall abide by Adventures, and any third Person operators,
safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets including the Assessment. Upon a Sellers
request, Purchaser agrees to promptly provide, but not later than the
Environmental Claim Date, copies of all reports, results, and other
documentation and data prepared or compiled by the Environmental Consultant
and presented to Purchaser. No Seller shall be deemed by its receipt of said
documents or otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, expressed,
implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets or the accuracy of
said documents or the information contained therein. During all periods that
Purchaser, the Environmental Consultant, or any of their respective agents,
employees or representatives are on the Assets, Purchaser shall maintain, at
its sole expense and with reputable insurers, such insurance as is reasonably
sufficient to support Purchasers indemnity obligations under Section 7.6. All
information (including all reports, results and documentation containing such
information) acquired by Purchaser, the Environmental Consultant, or their
respective agents, employees or representatives, in conducting the Assessment
under this Section shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.2 **_NORM_**.

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges the following:

 



 

(a) The Assets have been used for exploration, development, and production of
oil and gas and there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other
materials located on or under the Properties or associated with the Assets.

 



 

(b) Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, Hazardous
Materials, or NORM.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms.

 



 

(d) The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included
in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Materials.

 



 

(e) NORM containing material and other wastes or Hazardous Materials may have
come in contact with the soil.

 



 

(f) Special procedures may be required for the remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of soil, wastes, asbestos, Hazardous Materials,
and NORM from the Assets.

 



 

Section 4.3 **_Notice of Violations of Environmental Laws_**.

 



 

Purchaser may deliver claim notices to Sellers in writing (an "
**Environmental Defect Notice** "), on or before the day that is seven (7)
Business Days before the Scheduled Closing Date (the " **Environmental Claim
Date** "), of each individual environmental matter disclosed by the Assessment
that (i) constitutes a present violation of Environmental Laws in effect in
the jurisdiction to which the affected Assets are subject, or (ii) constitutes
a physical condition that requires, if known, or will require, once
sufficiently discovered, reporting to a Governmental Authority, investigation,
monitoring, removal, cleanup, remediation, restoration or correction under
Environmental Laws, in each case of (i) and (ii) that would result in
Environmental Liabilities for which the Environmental Defect Amount exceeds
the Individual Defect Threshold (either of (i) or (ii), an " **Environmental
Defect** "); provided that "Environmental Defect" shall exclude any such
violation or condition to the extent caused by or arising from the ownership
or operation of any Retained Wellbore, which matters are addressed in Section
11.2(c)(iii). The Environmental Defect Notice shall provide (i) a reasonably
detailed description of the specific matter that is an alleged violation of
Environmental Laws; (ii) the Assets affected; (iii) a reasonable estimate of
the Environmental Defect Amount; and (iv) supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Sellers (as well as any consultant, inspector or expert hired by
a Seller) to verify the existence of the facts alleged in the Environmental
Defect Notice. The failure of an Environmental Defect Notice to contain item
nos. (i) through (iv) of the prior sentence shall not render such notice void
and ineffective if it materially complies with the provisions hereof. As used
herein, the " **Environmental Defect Amount** " means an amount equal to the
cost of the Lowest Cost Response applicable to an Environmental Defect.

 



 

Section 4.4 **_Remedies for Violations of Environmental Laws_**.

 



 

(a) If Sellers confirm to their reasonable satisfaction that any individual
matter described in an Environmental Defect Notice delivered pursuant to
Section 4.3 constitutes an Environmental Defect for which the Environmental
Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold, then subject to
Sellers continuing right to contest an Environmental Defect or Environmental
Defect Amount under Section 4.4(b), Sellers shall, at their sole joint
election, elect one of the following options on or prior to Closing and/or at
the time specified below:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Amount;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) retain the Assets that are alleged to be affected by the Environmental
Defect, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the sum of the Allocated Values of such Assets (determined without
duplication);

 



 

(iii) perform or cause to be performed prior to the Closing, at the sole cost
and expense of Sellers and to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, such
remedial operations as are contemplated by the Lowest Cost Response to address
the alleged Environmental Defect;

 



 

(iv) enter into an agreement with Purchaser whereby one or more Sellers will
as soon as reasonably practicable after Closing, at the sole cost and expense
of such Seller(s), perform or cause to be performed such operations as are
contemplated by the Lowest Cost Response to address the matter disclosed in
such Environmental Defect Notice;

 



 

(v) if such Environmental Defect can be cured by paying a fine or penalty, one
or more Sellers may cure such Environmental Defect by electing to pay such
fine or penalty and making such payment prior to the Closing; or

 



 

(vi) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10;

 



 

provided, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event that the Environmental Defect Amount exceeds the Allocated Values of
the Assets affected thereby, Purchaser may elect to cause Sellers to retain
such Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the sum of the Allocated Values of such Assets (determined without
duplication).

 



 

If Sellers elect the option set forth in Section 4.4(a)(i), then Purchaser
shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and expenses
attributable to the remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect and all
Damages with respect thereto. If Sellers make any election other than Section
4.4(a)(ii) or Section 4.4(a)(iv) with respect to an Environmental Defect or
Environmental Defect Amount but such Environmental Defect or Environmental
Defect Amount is to be determined by the Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to
Section 4.4(b), then within five (5) Business Days after the Environmental
Arbitrator has made its determination, Sellers at their option may change
their election to Section 4.4(a)(ii), and any retained Assets under Section
4.4(a) shall become Excluded Assets hereunder. If Sellers elect the option set
forth in Section 4.4(a)(iv), and Purchaser and Sellers have failed to agree by
Closing on the terms of the agreement contemplated thereby (which the Parties
shall use good faith efforts to reach), Sellers shall then proceed with
respect to such matter under another applicable election.

 



 

(b) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all timely alleged
Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts, and the sufficiency of
any cures performed pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(iii), prior to the Closing
Date. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree prior to the Closing Date,
the Assets affected by the unresolved Environmental Defects and Environmental
Defect Amounts shall be excluded

 



      
 

 



 

from the Assets at the Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Values thereof, and the Environmental Defects and Environmental
Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.4(b). During the thirty (30) day period
following the Closing Date, Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect
Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to an environmental attorney with at
least ten (10) years experience in evaluating the compliance with
Environmental Laws of oil and gas assets similarly situated to the Properties
in one or more of the jurisdictions where they are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of Purchaser and Sellers or absent such agreement during the
thirty (30) day period, by the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " **Environmental Arbitrator** "). Likewise, if
by the end of an agreed post-closing cure period under Section 4.4(a)(iv),
Sellers and Purchaser have been unable to agree upon whether any Environmental
Defects have been cured, the cure in dispute shall be submitted to the
Environmental Arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
agreed timeline for the cure. The Environmental Arbitrator shall not have
worked as an employee or outside counsel for either Party or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have any
financial interest in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in English and in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 4.4(b). The
Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
the Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Article 4
and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental
Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.
Additionally, the Environmental Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator, including environmental
attorneys from other states and professional environmental consultants. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects, attempted cures, and
Environmental Defect Amounts, as applicable, submitted by any Party and may
not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any
matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting
its case. Sellers shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator, and Purchaser shall bear one-half of such costs and
expenses. Within five (5) Business Days after the Environmental Arbitrators
decision with respect to a disputed Environmental Defect or Environmental
Defect Amount and assuming that no Party exercises its right (if any) to
permit or cause Sellers to retain the Assets affected thereby, (I) Sellers
shall assign such Assets to Purchaser using substantially the same form as the
Conveyance and (II) the Parties shall account to one another as if such Assets
had been conveyed at Closing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Sellers for individual Environmental Defects for which the Environmental
Defect Amount does not exceed the Individual Defect Threshold, and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Sellers for Environmental Defects unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Environmental

 



      
 

 



 

Defect Amounts covered by Section 4.4(a)(i) that exceed the Individual Defect
Threshold, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the
Purchase Price (the " **Environmental Defect Deductible** "), after which
point Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other available remedies under this Section 4.4 with respect to Environmental
Defects in excess of the Environmental Defect Deductible, subject to the
Individual Defect Threshold, and Sellers elections under this Section 4.4.
The Environmental Defect Amount of any Property retained by Sellers in
accordance with Section 4.4(a) may be used in meeting the Environmental Defect
Deductible.

 



 

Section 4.5 **_Limitations_**.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Article 4 and
Section 5.20 are intended to be the sole and exclusive remedy that Purchaser
Indemnitees shall have against Seller Indemnitees with respect to any matter
or circumstance relating to Environmental Laws, the release of materials into
the environment or protection of the environment or health. Except to the
limited extent necessary to enforce the terms of this Article 4 or Section
5.20, Purchaser (on behalf of itself, each of the other Purchaser Indemnitees
and their respective insurers and successors in interest) hereby releases and
discharges any and all claims and remedies at Law or in equity, known or
unknown, whether now existing or arising in the future, contingent or
otherwise, against the Seller Indemnitees with respect to any matter or
circumstance relating to Environmental Laws, the release of materials into the
environment or protection of the environment or health **EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS
OR DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT, EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER INDEMNITEES**. Purchaser acknowledges
that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.20,
no Seller has made or will make any representation or warranty regarding any
matter or circumstance relating to Environmental Laws, or the release of
materials into the environment or protection of the environment or health, and
that nothing in this Agreement or otherwise (other than Section 5.20) shall be
construed as such a representation or warranty.

within the boundaries of the applicable Leases or within limits otherwise
permitted by applicable Law. To the knowledge of such Seller, no Well included

(b) A Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after any officer of such Seller
obtains actual knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be
untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or

this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchasers or a Sellers
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date (other than on a specified date) shall not have been so performed or
observed in any material respect, but if such breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be cured by the Closing
(or, if the Closing does not occur, by the date set forth in Section 10.1),
then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.4 **_Operatorship_**.

 



 

Sellers make no representation and do not warrant or guarantee that Purchaser
will succeed in being appointed successor operator for the Adventure Operated
Assets or any other Assets. Purchaser shall promptly, following Closing (or by
Closing for those items subject to Section 12.6), file all appropriate or
required forms, applications, permit transfers, declarations, guarantees,
Asset Bonds or other financial support with federal and state agencies
relative to its assumption of operatorship of the Adventure Operated Assets.
For all Adventure Operated Assets, at Closing, Adventure shall execute and
deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall promptly file, the applicable
governmental forms transferring record operatorship of the Adventure Operated
Assets to Purchaser.

 



 

Section 7.5 **_Operation of Business_**.

 



 

Except (i) as expressly contemplated by the other provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) as set forth on Schedule 7.5 or for expenditures or operations
set forth on Schedule 5.9, (iii) for the renewal of expiring insurance
coverage in the ordinary course of business, (iv) the amendment, extension or
modification of credit, hedge, financing, security or similar agreements that
are to be released from the Assets at Closing, and (v) as otherwise consented
to in writing by Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, until the Closing, (x) Adventure will operate the Adventure
Operated Assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices and will maintain all material existing Governmental Authorizations
necessary for its operation of the Adventure Operated Assets as currently
operated by Adventure, and (y) each Seller:

 



 

(a) will not commit to any single operation, or series of related operations,
reasonably anticipated by such Seller to require future capital expenditures
by the owner of the Assets in excess of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000) (net to Sellers interest) or make any capital expenditures related
to the Assets in excess of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000)
(net to Sellers interest);

 



      
 

 



 

(b) will not terminate, materially amend, execute or extend any material
agreements affecting the Assets;

 



 

(c) will maintain its current insurance coverage on the Assets, if any,
presently furnished by unaffiliated third Persons in the amounts and of the
types presently in force;

 



 

(d) will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and
effect all Leases;

 



 

(e) will maintain all material existing Governmental Authorizations necessary
for such Sellers ownership of the Assets as currently owned;

 



 

(f) will not transfer, farmout, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise
dispose of any Assets except for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbon
production and surplus and inventoried Equipment made in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practices;

 



 

(g) will not make or revoke any material Tax election with respect to the
Assets, file any amended Tax Return with respect to the Assets or enter,
settle or compromise any Tax audit or other dispute or proceeding for Taxes
with respect to the Assets; and

 



 

(h) will not commit to do any act prohibited by the foregoing clauses (a)-(g).

 



 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, all
proceeds received by a Seller prior to Closing from the sale of surplus and
inventoried Equipment shall, as between Purchaser and such Seller, be the
property of such Seller, and there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase
Price for the same. Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this
Section 7.5 shall be considered granted within five (5) Business Days (unless
a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter
time is specified in a written notice from a Seller) of notice from a Seller
to Purchaser requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies such Seller to
the contrary during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
of an emergency or a serious risk to life, property, or the environment, any
Seller may take or consent to such action as a prudent operator, or non-
operator as the case may be, would take and without obtaining Purchasers
prior consent; provided such Seller shall notify Purchaser of such action
promptly thereafter. However, except for emergency action that must be taken
in the face of serious risk to life, property, or the environment, no Seller
shall have any obligation to undertake any actions with respect to the Assets
that are not required in the course of the normal operation of the Assets
consistent with past practices.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Sellers shall have no
liability to Purchaser for the incorrect payment of delay rentals, royalties,
overriding royalties, shut-in payments or similar payments made during the
Adjustment Period or for failure to make such payments through mistake or
oversight (including a Sellers negligence or other fault), except that, to
the extent such incorrect payment causes Sellers to have less than Defensible
Title to a Lease or Well prior

 



       
 

 



 

to Closing, Purchaser may, until the Title Claim Date, assert a Title Defect
under Section 3.4(a) with respect to such matter.

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges each Seller may own fractional undivided interests in
certain of the Assets and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of any
other working interest owner or any operator who is not affiliated with such
Seller shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this Section 7.5
by such Seller nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest
owners constitute such a violation so long as such Seller has voted its
interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.5.

 



 

Section 7.6 **_Indemnity Regarding Access_**.

 



 

Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the Purchaser Indemnitees and the
Environmental Consultant, hereby releases and agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless all Seller Indemnitees and the other owners of interests in the
leases and wells described on Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1 from and against any
and all Damages, including claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses
attributable to personal injuries, death, or property damage, arising out of
or relating to any and all access by the Purchaser Indemnitees or the
Environmental Consultant to any Sellers offices, the Assets or the Records
(or other related information), or any related activities of the Purchaser
Indemnitees prior to Closing, **EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, ANY CLAIMS,
LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY.**

 



 

Section 7.7 **_Other Preferential Rights_**.

 



 

Should a third Person fail to exercise its preferential right to purchase as
to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or
waiver has not yet expired, subject to the remaining provisions of this
Section 7.7, the Assets or portion thereof subject to such preferential right
shall be excluded from the Assets transferred at Closing and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets or
portions thereof. If a holder of preferential right thereafter fails to
consummate the purchase of the Assets subject to such preferential right on or
before the end of the time period for closing such sale or the time for
exercising or waiving such preferential right expires without exercise by the
holder thereof, as applicable, each Seller whose interests in the Assets is
subject to such preferential right shall provide written notice to Purchaser
and shall sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from each such
Seller within thirty (30) days after such notice, all such Assets or portions
thereof not being sold to the third Person for a purchase price equal to the
Allocated Value of such Assets or portions thereof, adjusted as provided in
Section 2.2.

 



 

Prior to Closing, should any third Person bring any Proceeding seeking to
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce preferential rights,
the Assets or portion thereof subject to such Proceeding shall be excluded
from the Assets transferred at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets or portions thereof. Promptly
after

 



      
 

 



 

the Proceeding is dismissed or settled or a judgment is rendered in favor of a
Seller whose interests in the Assets is subject to such preferential right, as
applicable, each such Seller shall sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase from each such Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice
from such Seller(s) of such dismissal, settlement or judgment, all such Assets
or portions thereof not being sold to the third Person for a purchase price
equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets or portions thereof, adjusted as
provided in Section 2.2; provided such Seller(s) shall have no obligation of
sale under this paragraph if the applicable dismissal, settlement or judgment
does not occur before the Final Settlement Date.

 



 

Section 7.8 **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 12.3, each Seller shall be
responsible for its Seller Share of all ad valorem, real property, personal
property, severance, production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by
the ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons
therefrom (" **Property Taxes** ") that are attributable to any period of time
at or prior to Effective Time. Purchaser shall be responsible for all Property
Taxes that are attributable to any period of time after the Effective Time.
Regardless of which Party is responsible, each Seller shall handle payment to
the appropriate Governmental Body of all Property Taxes affecting the
ownership or operation of its interests in the Assets which are required to be
paid prior to Closing (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such
Property Taxes), and Purchaser shall handle payment to the appropriate
Governmental Body of all Taxes affecting the ownership or operation of the
Assets which are required to be paid after Closing (and shall file all Tax
Returns with respect to such Taxes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 7.8(a) shall not apply to any Taxes other than Property Taxes,
including income, franchise, corporate, business and occupation, business
license and similar Taxes, and Tax Returns therefor, which shall be borne,
paid and filed by the Party responsible for such Taxes under applicable Law.
If requested by Purchaser, Sellers will assist Purchaser with preparation of
all Property Tax Returns due on or before thirty (30) days after Closing
(including any extensions requested). Each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
within thirty (30) days of filing copies of all Tax Returns filed by such
Seller after the Closing Date affecting the Assets and any supporting
documentation provided by such Seller to Governmental Bodies.

 



 

(b) If a Seller or Purchaser (or an Affiliate of a Seller or Purchaser)
receives a refund of any Taxes (whether by payment, credit offset or
otherwise, with any interest thereon) covered by Section 7.8(a) that are paid
by and required to be borne by the other Party, the Party that received (or
whose Affiliate that received) such refund shall promptly (but no later than
thirty (30) days after receipt) remit payment to such other Party of an amount
equal to the refund amount, including all relevant documentation. Each Party
shall cooperate with the other and its Affiliates in order to take all
reasonably necessary steps to claim any refund to which it is entitled.
Purchaser agrees to notify Sellers within ten (10) days following the
discovery of a right to claim any refund to which any Seller is entitled and
upon receipt of any such refund. Except to the extent required by applicable
Laws, Purchaser shall not and shall not permit its Affiliates to amend any Tax
Returns with respect to Taxes for which a Seller is liable under this Section
7.8 or for which a Seller may be liable to indemnify Purchaser under Section

 



      
 

 



 

11.2, without the consent of such Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) Control of any legal or administrative Proceedings concerning any Property
Taxes affecting the Assets shall belong to the Party responsible for such
Property Taxes under this Section 7.8.

 



 

(d) Purchaser agrees to cooperate with each Seller so that such Sellers
transfer of the Assets to Purchaser shall, at such Sellers election, be
accomplished in a manner enabling the transfer of all or part of the Assets to
qualify as a part of a like-kind exchange of property by such Seller within
the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code. If a Seller so elects, Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with such Seller to effect such like-kind exchange,
which cooperation shall include taking such actions as such Seller reasonably
requests in order to pay the Purchase Price in a manner which enables such
transfer to qualify as part of a like-kind exchange of property within the
meaning of Section 1031 of the Code, and Purchaser agrees that such Seller may
assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to an escrow
agent acting as a qualified intermediary under United States Treasury
Regulations, to qualify the transfer of the Purchase Price as a part of a
like-kind exchange of property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code.
Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) the Closing shall not be
delayed or effected by reason of any assignment of this Agreement as described
in this Section 7.8(d), (ii) any assignment of this Agreement to a Qualified
Intermediary shall not release any Party from any of their respective
liabilities and obligations under this Agreement, (iii) no Party, by its
consent granted under this Section 7.8(d), will be responsible in any way for
any other Partys compliance with the requirements of a like-kind exchange
under Section 1031 of the Code and (iv) no Party represents to another Party
that any particular tax treatment will be given to any Party as a result
thereof.

 



 

Section 7.9 **_Special Warranty of Title_**.

 



 

The Conveyance shall contain a covenant of each Seller to warrant Defensible
Title to the Properties after Closing from and against the lawful claims of
third Persons arising by, through or under such Seller, but not otherwise,
that are not reflected or referred to of record in the counties where the
lands covered by the Leases and Wells are located as of the date of this
Agreement (the " **Special Warranty** "); _provided, however_ , that Purchaser
shall not be entitled to claim a breach of the Special Warranty for any Title
Defect claimed in a Title Defect Notice or of which an officer of Purchaser
had knowledge on or before the Title Claim Date.

 



 

Section 7.10 **_Suspended Proceeds_**.

 



 

Each Seller shall transfer and remit to Purchaser, in the form of an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2(j), all monies
representing the value or proceeds of production removed or sold from the
Properties and held by such Seller at the time of the Closing for accounts
from which payment has been suspended, such monies, net of applicable rights
of set off or recoupment, being hereinafter called " **Suspended Proceeds** ".
Purchaser shall

 



      
 

 



 

be solely responsible for the proper distribution of such Suspended Proceeds
to the Person or Persons which or who are entitled to receive payment of the
same.

 



 

Section 7.11 **_Further Assurances_**.

 



 

After Closing, Sellers and Purchaser each agrees to take such further actions
and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are
reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of this
Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Date (other than representations and warranties that refer to a specified
date, which need only be true and correct on and as of such specified date),
except for such breaches, if any, as would not have a Material Adverse Effect
(provided that to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by
its terms by Material Adverse Effect, such qualification in its terms shall be
inapplicable for purposes of this Section 8.2(a) and the Material Adverse
Effect qualification contained in this Section 8.2(a) shall apply in lieu
thereof);

respects, all covenants and agreements to be performed or observed by Sellers
under this Agreement prior to or on the Closing Date;

 



 

(c) _Pending Litigation_. No Proceeding by a third Person (including any
Governmental Body) seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
pending before any Governmental Body or have resulted in an injunction, order
or award that grants such relief; provided, however, that Closing shall
proceed notwithstanding any Proceedings seeking to restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
brought by holders of preferential purchase rights seeking to

 



      
 

 



 

enforce such rights with respect to Assets with aggregate Allocated Values of
less than ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price;

 



 

(d) _Deliveries_. Each Seller shall be ready, willing and able to deliver to
Purchaser duly executed counterparts of the Conveyances and the other
documents and certificates to be delivered by such Seller under Section 9.2;
and

 



 

(e) _Title Defects, Environmental Defects and Other Adjustments_. The
aggregate amount of (i) the sum of all Title Defect Amounts for actual Title
Defects covered by Section 3.4(d)(i), less the sum of all Title Benefit

the sum of all Environmental Defect Amounts for actual Environmental Defects
covered by Section 4.4(a)(i), plus (iii) the sum of all adjustments to the

Section 9.4 **_Closing Payment and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, based upon the best information
available to Sellers, a preliminary settlement statement estimating the
Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all Purchase Price adjustments
set forth in Section 2.2 and the Deposit, together with reasonable supporting
information in Sellers possession reasonably necessary for Purchaser to
verify such adjustments. Within two Business Days after its receipt of such
preliminary settlement statement, Purchaser may submit to Sellers in writing
any objections or proposed changes thereto and Sellers shall consider all such
objections and proposed changes in good faith. The estimate agreed to by
Sellers and Purchaser, or, absent such agreement delivered in the preliminary
settlement statement in accordance with this Section 9.4(a) will be the dollar
amount to be paid by Purchaser to Sellers at the Closing, subject to
subsequent adjustments with respect to Title Defects (including any Consent
Requirements treated as Title Defects) and Environmental Defects as provided
in this Agreement (in each case to the extent not already reflected therein)
and pursuant to Section 7.10. The dollar amount to be delivered in accordance
with this Section 9.4(a) shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by
Purchaser to Sellers at the Closing (the " **Closing Payment** ").

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser a statement setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the
extent possible on actual credits, charges, receipts and other items before
and after the Effective Time and taking into account all adjustments provided
for in this Agreement. Each Seller shall at Purchasers request supply
reasonable documentation available to support any credit, charge, receipt or
other item. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the 30th day
following receipt of Sellers statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers a written report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be
made to such statement. Purchaser may not later contest or submit to the
Independent Expert any amounts or adjustments that were not contested in
Purchasers written report, which amounts or adjustments Purchaser will be
deemed to have accepted. If Purchaser does not timely deliver such written
report within such 30-day period, Purchaser shall be deemed to agree with the
adjustments set forth in Sellers statement. The Parties shall undertake to
agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (such final statement,
the " **Final Settlement Statement** "). In the event that the Parties cannot
agree on the Adjusted Purchase Price within one hundred and twenty (120) days
after the Closing Date, the specific disputed items will be automatically
referred to an independent expert of the Parties choosing with at least ten
(10) years of oil and gas accounting experience for

 



      
 

 



 

arbitration (the " **Independent Expert** "). If the Parties are unable to
agree upon an Independent Expert, then such Independent Expert shall be
selected by any Federal District Court or State District Court Judge in
Houston, Texas. The Independent Expert shall conduct the arbitration
proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section. The Independent Experts
determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on both Parties, without
right of appeal; _provided_ that disputes relating to any Title Defects or
Environmental Defects (including adjustments or remedies to be provided on
account thereof) shall be resolved in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and
Section 4.4(b). In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price, the Independent Expert shall not increase the Purchase Price
more than the increase proposed by Sellers nor decrease the Purchase Price
more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as applicable. The Independent
Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages
or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall each
bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Sellers shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Independent Expert and the
Purchaser shall bear one-half of such costs and expenses. Within ten (10) days
after the date on which the Parties agree (or are deemed to agree) on the
Final Settlement Statement or the Independent Expert finally determines the
disputed matters, as applicable, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount
by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment or (ii)
Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds
the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable. Any post-closing payment pursuant
to this Section 9.4 shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the Agreed Interest Rate.

 



 

(c) With respect to each payment made or to be made hereunder to Sellers,
Sellers shall designate in writing the portion of such payment to be made to a
Seller. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Sellers shall be in cash
by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of
applicable Seller pursuant to the wiring instructions reflected in Schedule
9.4(c) or as separately provided in writing. All payments made or to be made
hereunder to Purchaser shall be in cash by electronic transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to
Sellers.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 10_**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 10.1 **_Termination_**.

 



 

Subject to Section 10.2, this Agreement may be terminated: (i) at any time
prior to Closing by the mutual prior written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;
(ii) by Sellers or Purchaser if Closing has not occurred on or before August
29, 2014 (the " **Termination Date** "); (iii) by Purchaser if any condition
set forth in Section 8.2 has not been satisfied or waived at Closing or (iv)
by Sellers if any condition set forth in Section 8.1 has not been satisfied or
waived at

 



      
 

 



 

Closing; _provided, however_ , that termination under clauses (ii), (iii) or
(iv) shall not be effective until the Party electing to terminate has
delivered written notice to the other Party of its election to so terminate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Partys failure to perform or observe any
of its covenants or obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
shall have resulted in, the failure of Closing to occur on or prior to the
Termination Date because the conditions to the other Partys obligation to
perform at Closing in Article 8 have not been satisfied, the defaulting Party
shall not be entitled to exercise any right of termination under this Section
10.1.

 



 

Section 10.2 **_Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section
2.4, except as set forth in this Section 10.2 or Section 10.3, this Agreement
shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of Sections 5.6, 6.5, 7.6, 10.2,
11.6, 12.2, 12.4, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.11, 12.12, 12.14, 12.15, 12.16, 12.17,
and 12.18, and all disclaimers herein, all of which shall survive such
termination and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms) and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned
without any further action or liability to any Party or its respective
Indemnitees, and following such termination, each Seller shall be free
immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell,
transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without
any restriction under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.3 **_Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination_**.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 10.1(ii) or
Section 10.1(iv), each Seller has performed or is ready, willing and able to
perform all of its agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be
performed or observed at or prior to Closing, and Purchaser has failed to
perform or observe any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which
are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing, then:

 



 

(i) the Deposit shall be paid to Sellers as liquidated damages as Sellers
sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by Purchaser
under this Agreement, except for the indemnities provided in Section 7.6, and
all other rights and remedies arising under this Agreement (except for the
provisions that survive pursuant to Section 10.2, which shall remain in full
force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by Sellers. Subject to an
election by Sellers under Section 10.3(a)(ii), Sellers and Purchaser agree
upon the Deposit as liquidated damages due to the difficulty and inconvenience
of measuring actual damages and the uncertainty thereof, and Sellers and
Purchaser agree that such amount would be a reasonable estimate of Sellers
loss in the event of any such breach or failure to perform by Purchaser. Upon
such termination, each Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of
ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose
of the Assets to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) In lieu of termination of this Agreement, Sellers shall be entitled to
specific performance of this Agreement, it being specifically agreed that
monetary

 



       
 

 



 

damages will not be sufficient to compensate Sellers if Sellers determine the
same in their sole discretion. To seek specific performance and as a condition
thereto, Sellers must deliver notice in writing to Purchaser of Sellers
election to seek specific performance under this Section 10.3(a)(ii) within
thirty (30) days counted from and after the Termination Date. If Sellers elect
to seek specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.3(a)(ii), the Deposit shall be retained by the Escrow Agent until a non-
appealable final judgment or award on Sellers claim for specific performance
is rendered, at which time the Deposit shall be distributed as provided in the
judgment or award resolving the specific performance claim or shall be applied
as provided in Section 2.4 of this Agreement. Purchaser hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and agreements of Purchaser under
this Agreement. Sellers shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Parties hereto
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this paragraph,
including by the institution of a court proceeding, Sellers shall not in any
respect waive their rights to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to them under this Agreement (including those set forth in Section
10.2 and Section 10.3(a)(i)) in the event that the remedies provided for in
this paragraph are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing
set forth in this paragraph shall require Sellers to institute any Proceeding
for (or limit Sellers right to institute a Proceeding for) specific
performance prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
this Article 10, nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
paragraph restrict or limit Sellers right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with this Article 10.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1(ii)
or Section 10.1(iii), Purchaser has performed or is ready, willing and able to
perform all of its agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be
performed or observed at or prior to Closing, and a Seller has failed to
perform or observe any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which
are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing, then at Purchasers
option:

 



 

(i) The Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and Purchaser shall be entitled
to seek money damages from Sellers available at Law for any Sellers
applicable breach of this Agreement, as Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy
for any breach or failure to perform by Sellers under this Agreement, and all
other rights and remedies arising under this Agreement (except for the
provisions that survive pursuant to Section 10.2, which shall remain in full
force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by Purchaser, and each Seller
shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and
to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person
without any restriction under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) In lieu of termination of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to
specific performance of this Agreement, it being specifically agreed that
monetary damages will not be sufficient to compensate Purchaser if Purchaser
determines the same in its sole discretion. To seek specific performance and
as a condition thereto, Purchaser must deliver notice in writing to Sellers of
Purchasers election to seek specific performance under this Section
10.3(b)(ii) within thirty (30) days counted from and after the Termination
Date. If Purchaser elects to seek specific performance of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.3(b)(ii), the Deposit shall be held by the Escrow
Agent, until a non-appealable final judgment or award on Purchasers claim for
specific performance is rendered, at which time the Deposit shall be
distributed as provided in the judgment or award resolving the specific
performance claim. Each Seller hereby agrees not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and agreements of such Seller under this
Agreement. Purchaser shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with seeking an injunction or injunctions to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Parties hereto
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this paragraph,
including by the institution of a court proceeding, Purchaser shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to it under this Agreement (including those set forth in Section 10.2 and
Section 10.3(b)(i)) in the event that the remedies provided for in this
paragraph are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set
forth in this paragraph shall require Purchaser to institute any Proceeding
for (or limit Purchasers right to institute a Proceeding for) specific
performance prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
this Article 10, nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
paragraph restrict or limit Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with this Article 10.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement terminates for reasons other than those set forth in
Section 10.3(a) or Section 10.3(b), the Deposit shall be returned to
Purchaser, free of any claims by Sellers to the Deposit, and the terms of
Section 10.2 shall apply.

 



 

(d) The Parties shall execute such joint instructions or other instruments as
are necessary to cause any distribution of the Deposit that is required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Adventure relinquishes operatorship of the applicable Adventure Operated
Assets, even if after the date of Closing.

(a) Without limiting Purchasers rights to indemnity under this Article 11, on
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and hereby agrees to fulfill,

expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts
reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of
investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement
of the indemnity; _provided, however_ , that no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification under this Section 11.2 for Damages that constitute (i) loss
of profits or other consequential, special or indirect damages, or any
punitive damages, except to the extent payable to a third Person that is not
an Indemnitee, or (ii) any liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or
judgment to the extent resulting from or increased by the actions or omissions
of any Purchaser Indemnitee after the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or a document to be
delivered hereto to the contrary, any claim for indemnity to which a Seller
Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled must be asserted by and through
a Seller or Purchaser, as applicable.

 



 

(g) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnity under Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates). Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to allow the
Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment in
accordance with this Agreement. An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate damages in respect of any Damages for which it is seeking
indemnification and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid costs
or expenses associated with such Damages and, if such costs and expenses
cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

 



 

Section 11.3 **_Indemnification Actions_**.

 



 

All claims for indemnification under Section 11.2 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term " **Indemnifying Party** " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Party having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11, and the term " **Indemnified Party** " when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Party
pursuant to this Article 11, subject to Section 11.2(f).

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Article 11, an Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 11.3,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the " **Claim Notice** "). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Party (a " **Third Party Claim** "), the Indemnified Party shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure
of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in
this Section 11.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
under Section 11.2 except to the extent such failure

 



      
 

 



 

prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third Party
Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an
inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the
Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
which was inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have fourteen (14) Business Days from its receipt
of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or
denies its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified
Party is authorized, prior to and during such fourteen (14) Business Day
period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party all costs of which
shall be included as Damages in respect of such claim for indemnification. The
failure to provide notice to the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be
denial of liability, except as may be provided in a subsequent notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and all related Proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.
If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, in contesting any Third
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified
Party may participate in, but not control, at its sole cost without any right
of reimbursement, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 11.3(d).
Irrespective of whether the Indemnified Party elects to participate in
contesting a Third Party Claim subject to this Section 11.3(d) in accordance
with the foregoing sentence, the Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and
expense shall provide to the Indemnified Party the following information with
respect to the Third Party Claim: all filings made by any party; all written
communications exchanged between any parties to the extent available to the
Indemnifying Party and not subject to a restriction on disclosure to the
Indemnified Party or potential waiver of attorney-client privilege in favor of
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party; and all orders, opinions,
rulings or motions. The Indemnifying Party shall deliver the foregoing items
to the Indemnified Party promptly after they become available to the
Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include a written
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim, or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party, in each case except for any settlement
made by the Indemnifying Party in which the only consideration is the payment
of money damages (or similar consideration) and/or obligations undertaken by
the Indemnifying Party and which payment and/or undertaking would otherwise
resolve all or a portion of the Third Party Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability for a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any proposed payment or settlement, whether whole or partial, and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt
of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability for the Third Party Claim
or portion thereof and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its
reasonable judgment, the proposed payment or settlement. If Indemnifying Party
fails to respond and admit in writing its liability during such ten (10) day
period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have denied liability and not
approved such proposed payment or settlement.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure or remedy the Damages complained of, (ii) admit
its liability for such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
30-day period that it has cured or remedied the Damages or that it disputes
the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
disputed the claim for such Damages.

 



 

Section 11.4 **_Limitation on Actions_**.

 



 

(a) All representations and warranties of Sellers and Purchaser contained
herein shall survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date and
expire thereafter; _provided, however_ , that (i) the representation and
warranty of Sellers contained in Section 5.18 and Section 5.21 shall expire on
the Closing Date, and (ii) the representations and warranties of Sellers
contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.6, and the representations and
warranties of Purchaser contained in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.8, 6.9 and
6.10 shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period and the representations and warranties contained in Section
5.8 shall survive until 60 days after the expiration (including any
extensions) of the applicable statute of limitations period. The covenants and
other agreements of Sellers and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement to be
performed on or before Closing shall expire on the day following the Closing
Date and each other covenant and agreement of Sellers and Purchaser shall
survive the Closing until fully performed in accordance with its terms and
expire thereafter. The affirmations of representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in the certificate delivered by each Party at Closing
pursuant to Sections 9.2(d) and 9.3(e), as applicable, shall survive the
Closing as to each representation, warranty covenant and agreement so affirmed
for the same period of time that the specific representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this Section 11.4, and
shall expire thereafter. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect after the respective
date of their expiration, after which time no claim may be asserted thereunder
by any Person, provided that there shall be no

 



      
 

 



 

termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its
expiration or termination date.

 



 

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.2(b)(iii) and 11.2(b)(iv) shall terminate
as of the termination date of each respective representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case
as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date.
Purchasers indemnities in Sections 7.6, 11.2(b)(i), 11.2(b)(ii) and
11.2(b)(v) shall continue without time limit. Each Sellers indemnities in
Section 11.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each
respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or
before such termination date. Each Sellers indemnities in Section
11.2(c)(iii) and Section 11.2(c)(iv) (solely as it pertains to clause (i),
(iii), and (iv) of the definition of "Seller Retained Obligations") shall
continue without time limit, subject however to applicable statutes of
limitations. Each Sellers indemnity in Section 11.2(c)(iv) (as it pertains to
clause (ii) of the definition of "Seller Retained Obligations") shall
terminate on the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, except for (i) claims for breaches of Sellers covenant in Section
7.8, (ii) claims for breaches of the Special Warranty, (iii) claims based on a
breach of a Sellers representation in Section 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 or 5.8, (iv)
the adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2 and any payments in
respect thereof, (v) claims based on the Seller Retained Obligations (provided
claims based on clause (i) of the definition of "Seller Retained Obligations"
shall be subject to the limitation in Section 11.4(c)(iii) below), or (vi)
claims asserted under Section 11.2(c)(iii):

 



 

(i) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
11.2(c) for any individual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or
judgment that does not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) as to
all Sellers in the aggregate, and such individual Damages may not be applied
towards the Indemnity Deductible;

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section 11.4(c)(i), Sellers shall not have any liability for
indemnification under Section 11.2(c) until and unless the aggregate amount of
the liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices are timely delivered by
Purchaser exceeds a deductible amount equal to three percent (3%) of the
Purchase Price (the " **Indemnity Deductible** "), after which point Purchaser
(or Purchaser Indemnitees) shall be entitled to claim Damages in excess of the
Indemnity Deductible; and

 



 

(iii) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser and Purchaser
Indemnitees for aggregate Damages in excess of ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

For purposes of indemnification associated with a breach of representation or
warranty hereunder, any dollar thresholds or materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifiers in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall each Sellers aggregate liability arising from claims for
breaches of such Sellers covenant in Section 7.8 or claims based on a breach
of such Sellers representation in Section 5.8 exceed such Sellers allocated
share of the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 11.5 **_Recording_**.

 



 

As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall record the Conveyances
in the appropriate counties as well as the appropriate governmental agencies
and provide Sellers with copies of all recorded or approved instruments.

 



 

Section 11.6 **_Waiver of Trade Practices Acts_**.

 



 

(a) IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES THAT PURCHASERS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES
WITH RESPECT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND WITH RESPECT TO ALL ACTS OR PRACTICES OF
SELLERS, PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY LEGAL PRINCIPLES OTHER THAN THE OKLAHOMA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT
(OKLA. STAT. ANN. TIT. 15 § 753 ET SEQ.), THE OKLAHOMA DECEPTIVE TRADE
PRACTICES ACT (OKLA. STAT. ANN TIT. 78 §§ 51-56), AND THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE
TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, SUBCHAPTER E OF CHAPTER 17, SECTIONS
17.41 ET SEQ., OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, AS AMENDED (THE "
**ACTS** "). AS SUCH, PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ACTS TO
THIS TRANSACTION AND ANY AND ALL DUTIES, RIGHTS OR REMEDIES THAT MIGHT BE
IMPOSED BY THE ACTS, WHETHER SUCH DUTIES, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ARE APPLIED
DIRECTLY BY THE ACTS ITSELF OR INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER STATUTES.
PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES, REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT IS PURCHASING THE
GOODS AND/OR SERVICES COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT FOR COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS USE
AND NOT FOR PERSONAL, FAMILY, AND HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES; THAT PURCHASER HAS
ASSETS OF TWENTY-FIVE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($25,000,000.00) OR MORE
ACCORDING TO ITS MOST RECENT FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
GAAP; THAT PURCHASER HAS KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS
MATTERS THAT ENABLE IT TO EVALUATE THE MERITS AND RISKS OF A TRANSACTION SUCH
AS THIS; AND THAT PURCHASER IS NOT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY DISPARATE BARGAINING
POSITION WITH SELLERS.

 



 

(b) PURCHASER EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZES THAT THE PRICE FOR WHICH EACH SELLER HAS
AGREED TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN PREDICATED
UPON THE INAPPLICABILITY OF

 



   

     
 

 



 

THE ACTS AND THIS WAIVER OF THE ACTS. PURCHASER FURTHER RECOGNIZES THAT EACH
SELLER, IN DETERMINING TO PROCEED WITH THE ENTERING INTO OF THIS AGREEMENT,
HAS EXPRESSLY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER AND THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE ACTS.

 



 

Section 11.7 **_Indemnity Escrow_**.

 



 

In order to provide security for Sellers indemnification obligations under
this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow shall be held by Escrow Agent, and
disbursed by Escrow Agent after the Closing in accordance with this Section
11.7 and the Escrow Agreement. With respect to each claim for indemnification
asserted by Purchaser against a Seller or Special Warranty claim pursuant to
the Conveyance during the period from and after the Closing Date up to first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " **Escrow Termination Date** "), upon
final resolution or determination of such an indemnity or warranty claim by
the Parties, Purchaser and Sellers shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to
disburse to Purchaser the amount set forth in such joint instruction, which
will be that portion of the Indemnity Escrow being held in the Indemnity
Escrow account as would satisfy such finally resolved or determined indemnity
or warranty claim. On the Escrow Termination Date, Sellers shall, subject to
the remainder of this sentence, be entitled to receive the Indemnity Escrow
balance as of such time and such amount shall be automatically distributed to
Sellers pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (and Purchaser and
Sellers shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to take any necessary actions in
order to accomplish the foregoing); provided, however, that Sellers at such
time shall not be entitled to, and Escrow Agent shall retain, any amounts
necessary to satisfy any unresolved Claim Notices that have been timely
delivered by Purchaser (which amounts shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow
until such Claim Notices are finally resolved or determined). If there are
remaining amounts due by any Seller to Purchaser pursuant to its indemnity
obligations after the Indemnity Escrow balance is exhausted, then such amounts
shall be promptly paid to Purchaser by such Seller as they are agreed by the
Purchaser and such Seller or finally determined in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. If there are any funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
account after the resolution of all previously outstanding Claim Notices, then
Sellers and Purchaser shall promptly jointly instruct Escrow Agent to release
the remaining account balance to Sellers.

 



 

Section 11.8 **_Endeavor Documents_**.

 



 

The Parties acknowledge that Adventure is engaged in efforts to obtain duly
executed originals of the Endeavor Documents and/or a materially comparable
interest in the rights and interests owned by Endeavor Energy Resources, LP
that are contemplated to be acquired by Adventure under the Endeavor Documents
(such materially comparable interest, the " **Endeavor Interest** "). In the
event Adventure does not obtain duly executed copies of each of the Endeavor
Documents by Closing, and Purchaser waives Adventures obligation to deliver
the Endeavor Documents pursuant to Section 9.2(g) as a condition of Closing,
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the
" **Endeavor Adjustment** "). In the event Adventure obtains duly executed
originals of each of the Endeavor Documents on or before the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, or otherwise obtains the Endeavor Interest pursuant to
other transaction documents, the Endeavor Documents and/or the Endeavor
Interest shall be deemed included in the Assets and, within ten (10) Business
Days after Adventure provides

 



      
 

 



 

notice thereof to Purchaser (including executed copies of the Endeavor
Documents or other relevant transaction documents), shall be assigned to
Purchaser using the form of Conveyance (provided the effective time shall be
the date of assignment), and Purchaser shall contemporaneously pay to
Adventure by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). If Adventure does not obtain duly executed
copies of each of the Endeavor Documents, or does not obtain the Endeavor
Interest, by the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Adventures right to
the Endeavor Adjustment shall automatically terminate, and Purchaser shall
have the right to engage Endeavor directly in an effort to enter into a joint
operating agreement and other related documents. In addition, the foregoing
provisions in this Section 11.8 with respect to the acquisition of the
Endeavor Interest shall equally apply to a partial acquisition of the Endeavor
Interest, except the relevant Endeavor Adjustment shall be proportionately
adjusted to reflect such partial acquisition..

Section 12.3 **_Sales or Use Tax Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and Fees_**.

 



 

Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall bear equally any
sales, use, excise, real property transfer, registration, documentary, stamp
or transfer Taxes, recording fees and similar Taxes and fees incurred and
imposed upon, or with respect to, the property transfers or other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties shall cooperate in determining the amount of
sales Tax, if any, that is due in connection with the sale of Assets and
Purchaser agrees to pay its allocable share of any such Tax to Sellers at
Closing. If such transfers or transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from
any such Taxes or fees, the Parties agree to cooperate with each other in good
faith to provide any documentation necessary to demonstrate that the
requirements for such exemptions are satisfied.

 



 

Section 12.4 **_Expenses_**.

 



 

Except as provided in Section 12.3, all expenses incurred by a Seller in

Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing,

respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no
right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to a Seller or any
of its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 12.6 **_Replacement of Asset Bonds_**.

 



 

The Parties understand that none of the Asset Bonds are to be transferred to
Purchaser. On or before Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be
obtained in the name of Purchaser, the corresponding Asset Bonds as necessary
to permit the cancellation or proportionate adjustment thereof, as applicable,
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser
may also provide evidence that such new Asset Bonds are not necessary as a
result of existing Asset Bonds that Purchaser has previously posted as long as
such existing Asset Bonds are adequate to secure the release of or
proportionately adjust, as applicable, those posted by a Seller and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
