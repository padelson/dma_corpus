2  

(b) _Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Merger Sub to (and of Parent
to cause Merger Sub to) accept for  payment, and pay for, any and all Shares
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
satisfaction (or to the extent waivable, the waiver by  Parent or Merger Sub
in their sole discretion) of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (as they
may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement,
collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ ") and not to any other  conditions.
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, at any time, to (i) increase the
Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition or (iii) make any other changes to
the terms and  conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written
consent of the Company: (A) the Minimum Condition may not be amended or 
waived, (B) Merger Sub shall not decrease the Offer Price and (C) no change

satisfy the Minimum Condition, (3) imposes conditions or requirements to the
Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (4) except as  provided in this
_Section 1.1_ , terminates the Offer or accelerates, extends or otherwise
changes the Expiration Date of the Offer, (5) otherwise amends or modifies any
of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects  any
holder of Class A Shares or that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Offer or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent
or Merger  Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions,
or (6) provide any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn
prior to the Expiration  Date (or any rescheduled or extended Expiration
Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article VIII_.

 

 

(c) _Expiration of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to
expire at  one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) following the  Offer Commencement Date
(the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent date to
which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 

 

(d) _Extension of the Offer_.

 

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this
Agreement has been  terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ and subject
to _Section 1.1(d)(ii)_ :

 

 

(A) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is  not
satisfied and has not been waived by Merger Sub or Parent, to the extent
waivable by Merger Sub or Parent, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional
period of up to  ten (10) Business Days per extension (or such longer period
per extension as the Parties may agree), to permit all Offer Conditions to be
satisfied; _provided_ _that_ if the sole then-unsatisfied Offer Condition
(other than those  conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Offer Acceptance Time) is the Minimum Condition, Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions for an additional
period of ten (10) Business Days  each (but may in its sole discretion elect
to extend the Offer in excess of two (2) occasions);

 

 

 

3  

(B) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
from time to time for  the minimum period required by any Law, any
interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or any rules and
regulations of Nasdaq applicable to the Offer (including in order to comply
with Rule 14e-1(b)  promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any
change in the Offer Price); and

 

 

(C) if, as of any scheduled Expiration Date (x)       all of the Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but each of
which would be satisfied if the Offer Acceptance Time were to then occur), (y)
the full amount of the Debt Financing necessary to pay the Required Financing
Amount has not been funded and will not be available to be funded at the Offer
Closing and at the Closing and (z) Parent and Merger  Sub acknowledge and
agree in writing that all Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs (d) and (h)
of _Annex I_ will be deemed satisfied or waived at the Expiration Time of the
Offer after giving effect to the extension pursuant to this
_Section       1.1(d)(i)(C)_ (if such Offer Conditions were actually
satisfied at the time of such extension), Merger Sub may extend the Offer for
successive periods of up to five (5) Business Days per extension (or such
longer period per extension as  the Parties may agree), with each such period
to end one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the last Business Day of
such period, in order to permit the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing necessary to pay the Required  Financing Amount, _provided_ , that
Merger Sub shall not be permitted to extend the Offer to a date later than the
Termination Date and provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, no
extension pursuant to this _Section  1.1(d)(i)(C)_ shall preclude the Company
from exercising any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.3(c)_

 

 

(ii) In no event shall Merger Sub: (i) be required to extend the Offer 
beyond the earlier to occur of (A) the valid termination of this Agreement in

prior written consent of the Company, be permitted to extend the Offer beyond
the Extension Deadline.

Merger  Sub not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If this  Agreement
is validly terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly and unconditionally terminate the
Offer and not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto, and Merger Sub shall, and

immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, after
giving effect to the Specified  Exchange (as defined in the Exchange
Agreement), other than (A) Class A Shares held in treasury by the Company, (B)
Class A Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub  (each
Class A Share referred to in _clauses_ _(A)_ and _(B)_ , an " _Excluded Share_
" and, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") and (C)       
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to the Offer Price per Class A Share in cash, without interest thereon
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, all such Class A
Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares), shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be  cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate formerly representing any such Class A Shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") and each book-entry formerly representing any such
uncertificated Class A Shares (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ")  shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders
thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Class A Shares
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender 
thereof in accordance with _Section 4.2_.

 

 

(ii) _Class B Shares_. Each Class B Share outstanding or held in treasury by
the Company  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor, and any certificate formerly representing any
Class B Shares shall not  entitle the holder thereof to any consideration or
other rights in respect thereof.

 

 

(iii) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share outstanding as of
immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall, cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist.

 

 

(b) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value  $0.01, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

4.2 _Surrender and Exchange of Shares_.

 

 

 

10  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited,  with a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an aggregate amount of cash
sufficient to pay all amounts required to be  delivered pursuant to _Section
1.1(g)(ii)_ and _Section 4.1(a)(i)_ in respect of such Class A Shares (such
cash, together with any other amounts deposited with the Paying Agent from
time to time and any interest thereon, the " _Exchange       Fund_ "),
to be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Class A Shares. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that (i) such  investments shall be an obligation of, or
guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in  certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of commercial banks and (ii) no
such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders  of Shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_.
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reason (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, payments from the Exchange Fund  in accordance with this Agreement)
below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange  Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient to make all cash payments required
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(i)_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the  Paying
Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to effect
the applicable terms of this Agreement. To the extent applicable, compensatory
consideration, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(i)_ in  respect of
Class A Shares, shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation's payroll as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later
than ten (10) Business Days thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant
to  _Section 4.2(f)._

 

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall  cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Class A
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Certificate in respect of Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and containing such customary provisions as
Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree (but in any event specifying
that the right to receive payments under _Section  4.1(a)_ shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 4.2(e)_ to the Paying Agent)) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof). Upon the surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as  provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent and specified in the transmittal
materials, the holder of such Certificate shall  be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ in respect of the Class A Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate (after giving effect to any  required Tax
withholding as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) in full satisfaction of any and
all rights with respect thereto, and any Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount 
payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
any Class A Shares represented by a Certificate that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a  Person other than the holder in whose name the Class A Shares
represented by such Certificate are registered upon (A) due surrender of the
Certificate, properly endorsed, and any and all other documents required to 
evidence and effect such transfer, duly executed and in proper form and (B)
evidence that any applicable transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable.

 

 

 

11  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Class A Shares or
Class B Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective
Time. If after the Effective Time a Certificate or book-entry account
statement evidencing ownership of any Class A Shares, or any valid certificate
representing any Class B Shares, in each case, outstanding immediately prior
to the  Effective Time is presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, such certificate shall be canceled and the Shares
formerly represented thereby treated in accordance with this _Article IV_.

 

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Following the  twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, upon Parent's request, any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company
shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Class A Shares (other than 
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any payment of cash to which
such Person is entitled hereunder (after giving effect to any required Tax 
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) upon due surrender of such
Person's Class A Shares in accordance with this _Section 4.2_ , without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation,  Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. To
the fullest extent  permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and  clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In  the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation (in a  form
reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation), the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the cash that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the
provisions  of this _Article IV_ (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered; provided, however, that the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed  Certificate may be required, as a condition precedent to
the payment of such Merger Consideration, to provide a bond or other security
in a customary amount if so required by the policies and procedures of the
Paying Agent.

 

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall  be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from the amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making  of such
payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
" _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely remitted to the 
applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. As soon as
reasonably  practicable prior to making any deduction or withholding pursuant
to this _Section 4.2(f)_ , Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall provide written notice to the
Company of any  anticipated deduction or withholding (together with the legal
basis therefor) and shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to reduce or
eliminate any amounts that would otherwise be deducted or withheld.

 

 

 

12  

(g) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event  within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to (i) mail or make available to each registered holder of
Uncertificated Shares (other than in respect of Excluded Shares) materials 
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of
its Class A Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii)
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message"  in customary form
(or such evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request),
reasonably promptly thereafter deliver the cash that such holder thereby
becomes entitled to receive in respect of its Class A Shares pursuant to
_Section       4.1(a)_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ), without interest thereon.

 

 

4.3 _Dissenters ' Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no  Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive only the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, except as set forth in this _Section
4.3_. If at any time following the Effective Time, a Person who otherwise
would be deemed to be a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively 
withdrawn or otherwise lost or fails to timely perfect the right to an
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall finally determine that the Dissenting 
Stockholder is not entitled to an appraisal with respect to any Shares, any
Class A Shares held by such Person shall thereupon be treated as though such
Shares had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive
the Merger  Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(i)_ and in accordance
with _Section 4.2_ (without interest and less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ). The Company shall give Parent written notice
as  promptly as practicable of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals
or attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders'
rights of  appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make or offer to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any  withdrawal of any such demands or waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL.
Any amounts required to be paid in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

4.4 _Adjustments_. In the event that, following the execution and delivery of
this  Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Shares or any other
equity interests of the Company, including any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any Shares or other equity interests of the
Company, shall have  been increased or decreased, or changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities (other than
as a result of any repurchase, redemption or issuance of capital stock
permitted by this Agreement and the issuance of  Class A Shares and
cancellation of Class B Shares in accordance with the Exchange Agreement),
including as a result of any reorganization, reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, 
recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar change in capitalization or
any other similar event or transaction, the Offer Price, Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately and  proportionately adjusted to reflect the effects of such
event.

 

 

4.5 _Treatment       of Equity Awards._

 

 

 

13  

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. At the Effective  Time, with respect to
each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted
under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ ")
that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,  whether vested
or unvested, (i) if the exercise price of such Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall terminate and
be cancelled as of immediately prior to the  Effective Time, without any
consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or
effect, and (ii) if the exercise price of such Company Option is less than the
Merger Consideration, such  Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to
receive, in accordance with this _Section 4.5(a)_ , a lump sum cash payment in
the amount equal to (i) the number of Shares underlying the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration minus the applicable exercise price (the product of (i) and
(ii), the " _Option Payment_ "). The Option Payment (if any) payable under
this _Section       4.5(a)_ shall be paid to each former holder of a
Company Option through the Surviving Corporation's payroll as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter), net of any  Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section 4.2(f)_.

 

 

(b) _Treatment of Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, with
respect to each outstanding stock  appreciation right (a " _Company SAR_ ")
granted under the Company Stock Plan, that was outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, (i) if the exercise price
of such Company  SAR is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company SAR shall terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, without any consideration being payable in respect
thereof, and have no further force or  effect and (ii) if the exercise price
of such Company SAR is less than the Merger Consideration, such Company SAR
shall terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
in exchange for the  right to receive, in accordance with this _Section
4.5(b)_ , a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to (i) the number of
Shares underlying such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise
price (the product of (i) and (ii), the " _SAR Payment_ "). The SAR Payment
(if any) payable under this _Section 4.5(b)_ shall be paid to each former
holder of a Company SAR through the Surviving Corporation's payroll as soon
as  practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than
ten (10) Business Days thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section 4.2(f)_.

 

 

(c) _Further Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of
directors of the Company or the compensation committee of the board of
directors of the Company, as applicable, shall  adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 4.5_ and ensure that following the Effective Time, (x) no
Person shall have any right to acquire any securities of the  Company or to
receive any payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted under the Company Stock Plan, except the right to receive a payment
with respect thereto as provided in _Section 4.2_ and this _Section  4.5_ and
(y) no Company Equity Award will be issued and outstanding.

from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and 
performance of this Agreement by the Company and/or the consummation by the
Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except, in each case, those that the failure to make or obtain would
not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Merger Sub to commence or consummate the Offer or the

18  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company

fund a portion of the Offer Acceptance  Consideration, the Merger
Consideration and other amounts payable hereunder through an investment in the
aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together
with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The  aggregate amount of the
Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters is sufficient to fund the
Required Financing Amount when required pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

 

(iv) As of the date of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the  parties thereto, is in full force
and effect, and is enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with
its terms, subject only to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date
of this Agreement,  each Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Issuer or Merger Sub, as applicable, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, is in full force and effect, and is
enforceable against the parties  thereto in accordance with its terms,
subject only to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

Affiliates  is a party relating to the Financing other than (A) as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letters or provided to the Company on or prior to
the date hereof and (B) customary engagement letter(s) or nondisclosure
agreement(s) or other  Contracts that do not adversely impact the
conditionality, availability or aggregate amount of the Financing.

 

 

(vi) The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that
the Company  is a third party beneficiary thereof and is entitled to enforce
such agreement to the extent provided therein, and that Parent and the Equity

beneficiary rights, in  each case in accordance with its terms and subject to
the limitations set forth therein and herein, including _Section 9.13_

has been amended, restated or otherwise modified (and no such amendment,
restatement or modification is contemplated) and (B) the respective
commitments set forth in the Commitment Letters have not been reduced, 
withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect
(and no such reduction, withdrawal, rescission, amendment, restatement or
modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other party  thereto), in each case except in connection with any amendments,
restatements or modifications to effectuate any "market flex" terms contained
in the Debt Commitment Letters or to add additional lenders, arrangers or 
agents thereto and re-allocate the commitments among such Persons in each case
as provided for therein). As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Issuer or Merger Sub is in breach of or default under any Commitment
Letter to  which it is a party, and no event has occurred which would (or
that with notice or lapse of time or both would) result in a breach of, or

under, any term or condition  in the Commitment Letter to which it is a
party, and to the Knowledge of Parent, no other party thereto is in breach of
or default under any of the Commitment Letters and no event has occurred which
would (or with notice or lapse of time or  both would) constitute a breach
of, or a default by, any such party under any term of or condition in the
Commitment Letters, or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable or materially delayed.  As of the date
of this Agreement, no party to any Commitment Letter has notified Parent of
its intention to terminate such Commitment Letter in whole or in part prior to
the Closing Date or not to provide any portion of the Financing  contemplated
thereby. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent (x) is not aware of any fact or 
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Parent, the
Issuer or Merger Sub, as applicable, in any of the Commitment Letters
inaccurate (taking into account any qualifiers as to knowledge and materiality
in such  representations and warranties), (y) has no reason to believe that
it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition to be satisfied

Letter to which it  is a party and (y) has no reason to believe that the
Required Financing Amount will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date,
including any reason to believe that either the Equity Investor or the Debt
Commitment Parties will not  perform their respective funding obligations
under the Commitment Letters to which they are a party in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions. Each of Parent, the Issuer, and Merger
Sub, as applicable, has fully paid any and  all commitment fees and other
fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to which it is a party to be paid
as of the date of this Agreement, and will pay (or cause to be paid) in full
any and all other commitment fees and other fees  required to be paid
thereunder as and when they become payable in accordance with the terms
thereof.

Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect
and is a valid and binding obligation of the  Guarantor and enforceable
against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default on the part of the  Guarantor
under the Limited Guarantee.

Agreement,  none of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries,

(ii) reasonably likely to be completed, in each case of _clauses_ _(i)_ and
_(ii)_ , taking into account the  financial terms of such proposal
(including, if applicable at the time of such determination, any changes to
the financial terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
then proposed by Parent in response to such offer or  otherwise), and such
legal, regulatory, financing and other aspects of such proposal that the
Company's board of directors considers appropriate.

 

 

(e) _No Change in  Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Except as provided in _Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.2(g)_ , the Company's
board of directors (and each of its committees) shall not (i)  withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal  (each, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), (ii) cause or permit the
Company or any  of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement partnership
agreement or other agreement (other  than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (each, an " _Alternative  Acquisition Agreement_ "),
(iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or to enter into an  Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, (iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
Schedule 14D-9, or (v) fail to expressly reaffirm publicly the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following  Parent's written
request to do so if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or
disclosed. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement
that solely describes the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and
the  operation of this Agreement with respect thereto (that includes a
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) shall not be deemed a Change in
Recommendation.

 

 

 

47  

(f) _Change in Recommendation for Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set  forth in this Agreement, including in _Section 6.2(e)_ ,
following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the
date of this Agreement that is not preceded by a breach of _Section 6.2(a)_ or
_Section 6.2(e)_   and that the Company's board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial
Advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Change in
Recommendation or terminate this  Agreement in response to such Acquisition
Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company's board of directors may, at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, make a Change in  Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_ in order to enter into a
definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement (or cause or permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into a definitive  Alternative
Acquisition Agreement) with respect to such Superior Proposal if, in either
case, prior thereto all of the following conditions are met:

 

 

(i) the Company shall have provided  to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall (A)
state that it has received a written Acquisition  Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (B) specify the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the Person or group making  the Acquisition Proposal) and (C)
include a copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement, proposed
financing commitment (if any) and any other ancillary agreements and other
documents relating to such  Acquisition Proposal;

 

 

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to making a Change in
Recommendation or terminating  this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.3(b)_ , as applicable, the Company shall have engaged and negotiated in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) during such four
(4) Business Day period, which may be  on a non-exclusive basis, with respect
to any adjustments proposed by Parent during such period to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby such that
the Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute  a Superior Proposal or
the Company's board of directors would no longer determine that the failure to
make such Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_ , as applicable, would be  inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 

 

 

48  

(iii) following the end of such four  (4) Business Day period, the Company's
board of directors shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with its Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal and taking into account any  revised terms proposed by
Parent, such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation or to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_ , as  applicable, would
continue to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any
material term or condition of such  Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice under _Section 6.2(f)(i))_ and compliance with the Company's
obligations under _Sections 6.2(f)(i) --(iii)_, except that each reference to
a four (4) Business Day period shall be to a two  (2) Business Day period.

 

 

(g) _Change in  Recommendation for Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, including in _Section
6.2(e)_ , upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company's board of
directors  may, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, make a Change
in Recommendation if prior thereto all of the following conditions are met:

 

 

(i) the Company's board of directors shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation  with its outside legal counsel, that an Intervening Event
has occurred and the failure to make a Change in Recommendation in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors'  fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;

 

 

(ii) the Company shall have provided  to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice, which notice shall (A) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the material circumstances giving  rise to such
Intervening Event and the rationale for the proposed Change in Recommendation
and (B) state expressly that, subject to _clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ below, the
Company's board of directors  has determined to make a Change in
Recommendation;

 

 

(iii) after providing such notice and prior to making such a Change in
Recommendation, the  Company shall have engaged and negotiated in good faith
with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) during such four (4)
Business Day period with respect to any adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the  transactions contemplated hereby such
that the failure of the Company's board of directors to make a Change in
Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with _clause
(iv)_ below would no longer be inconsistent  with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and

 

 

(iv) following the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the  Company's
board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and
taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make
a  Change in Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

 

 

49  

(h) _Certain  Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_
shall or shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard
to an  Acquisition Proposal, including from issuing a customary "stop, look
and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
complying with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from making any disclosure to the
Company's stockholders if the Company's board of directors concludes, after
consultation with outside legal counsel,  that such disclosure is required
under applicable Law; provided that this _Section 6.2(h)_ shall not be deemed
to permit the Company or the Company's board of directors to make a Change in
Recommendation except in accordance with _Section       6.2(f)_ or
_Section 6.2(g)_.

 

 

6.3 _[Reserved.]_

 

 

6.4 _[Reserved.]_

 

 

6.5        _Reasonable Best Efforts._

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
6.2_ , the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries  to) cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly take (or cause to be taken) all actions,
and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to
satisfy the other party's conditions  to, and to consummate and make
effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement no later than the Termination Date, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as  reasonably practicable the Required Regulatory Law
Filings that must be filed prior to Closing (which in any event shall occur
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) and all other
documentation to effect all necessary  notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, reports and other filings necessary or advisable to be filed
with or made to any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, (ii)
obtaining (and taking all steps necessary to obtain) all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, waivers, Licenses, permits, Orders,
expirations of waiting periods and authorizations  necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
obtaining (and cooperating  with each other in obtaining) any consent,
approval of, waiver or any exemption by and delivering notification to, any
non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with the Offer, the  Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby or to maintain and preserve the benefits to the Surviving
Corporation under the Material Contracts as of and following the consummation
of the Merger, and (iv)  executing and delivering any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement, provided, however, that such
efforts shall not include any  requirement to expend money (other than
filing, application, legal, or consulting fees), commence, defend or
participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial
or otherwise) to any third party. The Company and Parent  shall (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to), as applicable, reasonably promptly
advise the other party upon providing such notices or receiving any such
consents or waivers and, to the extent practicable, permit the other party 
to review in advance and consult with respect to the content and substance of
such consents or waivers.

 

 

 

50  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.5(a)_ , each of the
parties hereto agrees to (i) make, within ten (10) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, the notifications and filings required to be made
under the HSR Act and requesting early termination of the waiting period
thereunder, (ii) supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act and (iii) use reasonable best  efforts to take or cause to be
taken all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and to obtain any and all
consents, authorizations, waivers and approvals under the  HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Entity with
competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(c) Subject to _Section 6.5(d)_ , in the event that the parties receive a
request for information or  documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Laws, including a request for additional information (a "
_Second Request_ "), unless otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, the
parties will use their reasonable  best efforts to submit an appropriate
response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second Request as promptly
as practicable and advisable, and counsel for both parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second  Request review process.
None of the parties, without the other party's prior written consent, shall
(i) enter into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or otherwise agree
or commit to any arrangement,  that would have the effect of extending,
suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling the expiration or termination of
the waiting period applicable to the contemplated transactions under the HSR
Act or any Antitrust Laws, or (ii) enter into any timing or similar agreement,
or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the
parties not to consummate the contemplated transactions (or that would
otherwise  prevent or prohibit the parties from consummating the contemplated
transactions).

 

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with  respect to the Antitrust
Laws and Health Regulatory Laws and discuss in good faith the appropriate
course of action with respect to obtaining the consents, approvals, permits,
waiting period expirations or authorizations of any Governmental  Entity
required to consummate the Offer prior to the Termination Date. No party
hereto or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive call
or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws or Health Regulatory Laws with any 
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable Law,
first giving the other party or its counsel prior notice of such call or
meeting and, to the  extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend and participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to
the extent practicable and permitted by applicable Law, (i) each party shall
notify  the other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or
substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Affiliates intends to
make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject
of this _Section 6.5_ ,  (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or making
any such communication or inquiry, such party shall provide the other party
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good
faith  the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing,
communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the submission of such
filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other  party with
a copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry and
(iv) consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing,
investigation or litigation by, or negotiations  with, any Governmental
Entity relating to the Offer or the Merger, including the scheduling of, and
strategic planning for, any substantive meetings with any Governmental Entity
relating thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation  rights, the
Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.5_ may be reasonably redacted as necessary to address 
reasonable privilege concerns.

 

 

 

51  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.5_ , each of the parties hereto,  including
their respective Subsidiaries, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
in connection with the HSR Act or any applicable Antitrust Laws, with respect
to  the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid the entry of, or effect
the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would
otherwise have the effect  of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this _Section 6.5_ , "reasonable best
efforts" shall include taking any and all actions (such actions, the "
_Regulatory Actions_ ")  necessary to obtain the consents, approvals,
permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any Governmental
Entity required to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby no later than the  Termination Date, including (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license,
hold separate, and other disposition of the businesses,  assets, products or
equity interests of the Company or any of Parent's other businesses, assets,
products or equity interests now owned or hereafter acquired by Parent, (ii)
creating, terminating, or amending any existing relationships,  ventures,
contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to any action that would
limit Parent's freedom of action with respect to the operation of, or its 
ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets,
products or equity interests of Parent or the Company (including any of their
respective Subsidiaries); provided that such Regulatory Actions shall be
conditioned upon  and become effective only from and after the Effective
Time.

 

 

(f) In furtherance and  not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.5_ , if any administrative or judicial Proceeding
by a Government Entity is instituted challenging the Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated  by this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,  judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger.

 

 

(g) The Company and Parent shall each, upon request, promptly furnish the
other  with any information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors or officers and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by
the other party that is necessary or advisable in connection with any
statement, filing,  notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

 

52  

(h) The Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the
status  of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of any notice or
other substantive written communications received by the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, or  any of their respective Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial
communications.

 

 

6.6 _Access;  Consultation_.

 

 

(a) Upon reasonable advance notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford Parent, the Debt Commitment Parties and their respective
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
Pre-Closing  Period, to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' employees,
properties, assets, books, records and contracts and (ii) during such Pre-
Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
furnish  promptly to Parent, the Debt Commitment Parties and their respective
Representatives all information concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries'
capital stock, business and personnel as may reasonably be requested by
Parent, the Debt  Commitment Parties or their respective Representatives in
connection with the Offer or the Merger; provided that no investigation
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by  the Company; and provided, further that
the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection or to
disclose any information pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ , to the extent that
(A) in the  reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, any applicable Law
or Order requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information or disclosure thereof would
expose the Company to an  unreasonable risk of liability for disclosure of
sensitive or personal information, (B) in the reasonable good faith judgment
of the Company, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a
third  party or its disclosure would violate the terms of any confidentiality
agreement or other Contract that is binding on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (C) disclosure of any such information or document  would
result in the waiver or loss of attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other legal privilege; provided, further that with respect to
the foregoing _clauses_ _(A)_ through _(C)_ of this _Section 6.6(a)_ , the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (I) obtain the required
consent of any such third party to provide such inspection or  disclosure,
(II) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address
such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and (III) in the case of
_clauses_ _(A),_ _(B)_ and _(C)_ , implement appropriate and mutually
agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner
to  remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of
appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint
defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the
parties determine that  doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating applicable Law or Order or jeopardizing
such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be
conducted in such a manner intended  not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Company. All requests for information made
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be directed to an executive officer of
the Company, or such Person as may be  designated by any such executive
officer.

 

 

 

53  

(b) The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate
competitively sensitive material as "Outside Counsel Only Material"  or with
similar restrictions. Such material and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient pursuant to the
terms of an agreement with respect thereto on terms that are reasonably
acceptable  to the Company and Parent and pursuant to which such information
shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to any directors, officers or
employees of the recipient without the express prior permission of the Company
or its legal counsel,  and shall be subject to any additional confidentiality
or joint defense agreement between the parties. All information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ , including all information and/or discussions
resulting from any access  provided pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ , shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive any termination
of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

 

 

(c) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this _Section 6.6_ or  otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings (other than  legal proceedings between Parent
and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand) or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of  interest with respect
to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding
that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its  continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable  privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these
privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

 

 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another if
they  become aware of any change, effect, circumstance or development that
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), or of any reasonably likely
failure of any  condition to Parent's or the Company's obligations to effect
the Merger (as applicable).

 

 

(e) Unless such action would violate applicable Law, the Company shall (i)
notify Parent, as far in advance as practicable, of any material  development
or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Affiliates receives
from or intends to make with any (x) Governmental Entity relating to any
current or prospective Proceeding or otherwise related to compliance with
Laws  or (y) any party to any material current or prospective civil
Proceeding, (ii) prior to making any such communication or inquiry, provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider
in good faith the comments  of the other party in connection with, any such
communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the making such
communication or inquiry, provide Parent with a copy of any such communication
or inquiry (if in written form) and (iv) consult  with Parent in connection
with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations
with, any Governmental Entity or party to any material civil Proceeding. In
exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the Parent and the  Company each
shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable and the Company
shall implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to address reasonable privilege 
concerns, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures,
redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to
any information to be so provided.

 

 

 

54  

6.7 _Stock Exchange De-listing and De-registration_. The Company shall take 
all commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the Class A Shares to
be de-listed from the Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon
as possible following the Effective Time.

 

 

6.8 _Publicity_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other on,
and  provide each other the opportunity to review and comment on, any press
releases or other public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to issuing or making
any such press  release or public announcement, except (a) as may be required
by or impracticable as a result of any applicable Law or Order or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or the rules and
regulations  of any national securities exchange or the Nasdaq to which such
party is subject or submits if the disclosing party has consulted with the
other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and content of any such
press release or public  statement, (b) any press release or public statement
that in the good faith judgment of the applicable party is consistent with
prior press releases issued or public statements made in compliance with this
_Section       6.8_ or (c) to the extent related to any Change in
Recommendation or Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

 

 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time who continues to remain employed with
the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately after the  Effective Time (a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending twelve (12) months thereafter, or, if earlier, the date such
Continuing Employee's employment terminates (the " _Continuation      
Period_ "), be provided with (i) a base salary or base wage that is no less
favorable than the base salary or base wage provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and  (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities or commission
opportunities (as applicable) that are no less favorable than the target
annual cash bonus opportunities or commission opportunities (as applicable)
provided to such Continuing  Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the Continuation Period,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Continuing
Employees with employee benefits (other than  any equity-based compensation
or benefits, transaction-triggered benefits, deferred compensation, defined
benefit pension, or retiree health or welfare benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the  Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company Plans listed on _Section 5.1(h)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Additionally, during the Continuation  Period,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each
Continuing Employee with severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing  Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
Company Plans set forth on _Section 5.1(h)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

 

 

 

 

55  

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to use reasonable  best efforts to provide that no pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to Continuing Employees
or their dependents under the group health benefit plans provided for those
individuals except to the extent such  condition or exclusion was applicable
to an individual Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With respect
to the first plan year during which the Continuing Employees begin
participating in any welfare benefit plan offered by  Parent or its
Affiliates (each a " _Parent Plan_ "), Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, each Continuing Employee with
credit for deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments and out-of-pocket 
requirements paid under a Company Plan during such plan year and prior to the
Continuing Employee's participation in such Parent Plan in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-insurance, co-payments or out-of-pocket requirements
under any  Parent Plan in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate during such year, to the same extent and for the same purpose as
credited under the corresponding Company Plan, _provided_ that no duplication
of benefits shall  result.

 

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide credit  to Continuing Employees for their
service with the Company, its Affiliates and each of their respective
predecessors as of the Effective Time for purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of paid time off and severance  benefits under the
Parent Plans (other than any equity-based compensation or benefits, defined
benefit pension, or retiree health or welfare benefits) to the same extent and
for the same purpose as credited under the corresponding Company  Plan as of
the Effective Time, _provided_ that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

 

(d) Each Continuing Employee who participates in a cash bonus program of the
Company, whether annual or otherwise, shall be eligible to  receive payment
of a cash bonus pursuant to the terms and conditions of such cash bonus
program, based on the Company's actual performance through the end of the
applicable performance period; _provided_ that the applicable performance
criteria may be equitably adjusted by the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company to account for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and all related  expenses and costs; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any such adjustment shall not adversely affect the participants in the
program.

 

 

 

(e) The       provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and neither any current or former
employee, nor any other individual associated therewith, is or shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third  party beneficiary to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (except to the
extent provided in _Section 9.8_ ), no provision of this Agreement is intended
to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment  of, or an amendment to, any
Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent to
amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or any other  benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ , (iv) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, 
from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or (v) be deemed to
confer upon any such individual or legal representative any rights under or
with respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated
by this  Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be
entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or
arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers'  Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall, in
accordance with the organizational  documents of the Surviving Corporation as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each individual who is (or who at any time prior to the Effective Time was) a
director or officer of the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries or is (or who
at any time prior to the Effective Time was) serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another Person (together with such individual's heirs,  executors and
administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all costs
(including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties or liabilities 
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or based on, in whole or in part, the fact that such
Indemnified Party prior to the  Effective Time is or was (or with respect to
any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Party in their capacity as) a
director or officer, of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of
the Company as a director, officer, employee or  agent of another Person, in
each case, whether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time, and
including any such claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations
arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and actions taken in connection herewith prior to the Effective Time),
to  the fullest extent the Surviving Corporation may do so in accordance with
its organizational documents and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
The Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent the  Surviving Corporation may do so in accordance with its
organizational documents and to the extent permitted under applicable Law;
provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it  is ultimately determined that the
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. The Surviving
Corporation shall ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, for a period of six  (6) years from and
after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than  are
presently set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational and governing documents of any
Subsidiary). Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Section       6.11_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of
such Indemnified Party as provided herein.

 

 

 

57  

(b)        Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary  liability insurance (collectively, "D _and O
Insurance_"), and fully pay for, "tail" insurance policies, with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as  favorable as the Company's
existing DandO Insurance policies (including in respect of coverage in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); provided, however that in no event shall the Company  expend for
such "tail" policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for its
DandO Insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such " _tail_ " 
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) effective as of the
Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for " _tail_ "  insurance policies for
DandO Insurance consistent with the obligations of the Company pursuant to the
prior sentence or (ii) continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after  the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as provided in the Company's existing DandO Insurance policies as
of the date of this Agreement,  or the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in the Company's  existing DandO Insurance
policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation expend for such policies, an
aggregate amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the  annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such DandO Insurance. If the
aggregate costs for any insurance coverage required to be obtained pursuant to
this _Section 6.11(b)_ exceeds three hundred percent (300%) of the annual 
premiums currently paid by the Company for such DandO Insurance, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a policy or "tail"
coverage with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
maximum  amount.

 

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or  assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall  transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case as a
condition thereto, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or their respective
successors or assigns), as applicable, shall cause such  Person to assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

 

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are intended to be for the  benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. The rights
of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.11_ shall be in addition to
any rights such individual may have under the Laws of the State of  Delaware,
any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, and Parent
acknowledges and agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses  and exculpation from liabilities in effect as of the date of this
Agreement in favor of any Indemnified Party for actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with  their terms.

 

 

 

58  

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or 
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such  Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

 

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall 
release, waive or impair any rights to any directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors or
officers or  other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.11_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such policies.

 

 

6.12 _Takeover Statute_. The Company and the Board shall (a) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (b) if  any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, grant
such approvals and take all actions necessary to ensure that such transactions
may be consummated as  promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

 

 

6.13 _Control of the Company 's or Parent's Operations_. Nothing contained
in  this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly,
rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise,  consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision of its operations.

 

 

6.14 _Section 16_ _(b)_. Prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall (and
shall be permitted to) take all actions as may be reasonably requested by any
party hereto to cause any dispositions (or deemed dispositions) of equity
securities of the Company (including any derivative  securities with respect
to any equity securities of the Company) by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or
any release of a Lender or a Purchaser of its commitment under or consent to
the termination  of, any Commitment Letter that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, (i) reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount
of the Financing below the Required Financing Amount; (ii) impose new or 
otherwise expand upon any of the conditions precedent to the funding of the
Financing; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters or the definitive
agreements with  respect thereto; provided that any amendment, supplement or
modification (x) to effectuate any "market flex" terms expressly set forth in

written consent of the Company.

 

 

 

61  

(c) Parent shall maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (i) use
reasonable best efforts to ensure the accuracy of all  representations and

62  

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
(including any flex rights) and  conditions contemplated in any Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i)
alternative third-party debt or third-party preferred equity  financing for
any such portion, in an amount that is sufficient, when added to any portion
of the Debt Financing that is available and the Equity Financing, to pay the
Required Financing Amount prior to the Termination Date (the "
_Alternative       Financing_ ") and (ii) a new Debt Commitment Letter
and new definitive agreements with respect to such Alternative Financing not
imposing economic terms that are, taken as a whole, less favorable to Parent
or other terms less favorable in  any material respect, including any new or
additional condition to the availability of or obligation to fund and make
available the proceeds of the financing under, or otherwise expanding any
condition to draw or adding other terms that would  reasonably be expected to
materially affect the availability of the Financing at, the Closing (the "
_Alternative Financing Commitments_ "). Parent shall promptly provide the
Company with true, correct and complete copies of any new Debt  Commitment
Letter and any fee letter (subject to customary redactions to remove any fees
and other economic terms, none of which would result in any additional
conditionality to the availability of the Financing, adversely impact the 
enforceability (or alter the termination provisions thereof) or reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the financing contemplated thereby) in
connection therewith. If any new Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (A) any
reference in this  Agreement to the "Commitment Letters" or "Debt Commitment
Letters" shall be deemed to include such new Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent still then in effect (together with any accompanying fee letter), (B)
any reference in this Agreement  to the "Financing" (as it relates to the
portion comprised of the Debt Financing) or the "Debt Financing" shall mean
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified
pursuant to the foregoing,(C) any reference in  this Agreement to the
"Lenders", the "Purchasers", the "Debt Commitment Parties" or the "Financing
Sources" shall be deemed to include the lender or purchaser parties to such
new Debt Commitment Letter to the extent still then in effect.  
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.15_ or anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall (I) the reasonable best
efforts of Parent, the Issuer or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require  Parent, the Issuer or Merger Sub to, and none of Parent, the Issuer
or Merger Sub shall be required to, (x) incur or pay any fees to obtain a
waiver or amendment of any term of the Debt Commitment Letters or fees (in the
aggregate) in excess  of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date of this Agreement, (y) agree to conditionality or economic terms
with respect to the Debt Financing that are, taken as a whole, materially less
favorable than those  contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or related
fee letters (including any flex provisions therein) as of the date of this
Agreement, or (z) seek or accept equity financing from a Person other than the
Guarantors or in an amount in  excess of the Equity Financing Commitments as
of the date of this Agreement and (II) Parent, the Issuer or Merger Sub have
any obligation to take any action pursuant to this clause (e) that would cause
it to breach any other provisions of  this _Section 6.15_.

 

 

(f) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall (i) upon request by the
Company, keep the Company informed in  reasonable detail of material activity
concerning the Financing (including the status of its efforts to obtain the
Financing or any alternative financing pursuant to _Section 6.15(e)_ ) and
(ii) promptly provide the Company with copies  of all executed amendments,
written modifications or replacements of any Debt Commitment Letter (it being
understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements shall only be as
permitted herein), and such other information and  documentation (including
definitive agreements related to the Financing) available to Parent as shall
be reasonably requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the progress
of the financing activities, subject to the confidentiality  obligations
applicable to the Debt Commitment Letters. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company (A) of any breach (or
threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that could 
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of
which Parent becomes aware, (B) of the receipt by Parent of any written notice
or  communication from the Equity Investor or any Debt Commitment Party with
respect to any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default), or any  termination or repudiation or threatened termination or
repudiation, in each case by any party to a Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of any
Commitment Letter or such definitive  agreements, (C) of any material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing, including with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount  of the Financing to be funded
at the Closing, in each case, if Parent at any time believes it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing constituting the Required
Financing Amount on the terms, in the manner or from the  sources
contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements
related to any of the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement amends, limits or modifies Parent, the Issuer's and Merger Sub's,
as  applicable, right under the respective Financing Commitments.

 

 

 

63  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein but without
limiting or amending the provisions of _Section       6.15_ , Article
VIII or Section 9.13, the parties acknowledge and agree that neither the
obtaining nor the availability nor funding of the Debt Financing is a
condition to Parent's or Merger Sub's obligation to timely consummate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required hereby.

 

 

(h) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and their respective  Representatives from and against any and

suffered or incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries  and their respective
Representatives in connection with the Company's cooperation with the Debt

control) the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against
Parent and/or its officers or directors, in each case relating to the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in  accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon joint defense
agreement, _provided_ , that neither the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, nor Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective  Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, on the other
hand, shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or offer or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
stockholder litigation or consent  to the same unless the other party hereto
shall have consented in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

 

6.18 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the scheduled  expiration of the Offer,
the Company (acting through the Company Board and its Compensation Committee)
shall use reasonable efforts to take all such steps as may be required to

obligations  pursuant to, and implement the terms of, the Exchange Agreement,

"materiality," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification
therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not, and would  not
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B) at any
time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall

Days prior to the Termination Date; provided that  the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)_ if the

covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

 

 

(b)   in order to substantially concurrently enter into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section 6.2(f)_ , provided that the Company shall not be

concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent the Company
Termination Fee required to be paid  pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ or if the
Company is in breach of _Section 6.2_ ; or

 

 

(c) if (i) all of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived at

which would be  satisfied if the Offer Acceptance Time were to then occur),
(ii) Merger Sub shall have failed (or Parent shall have failed to cause Merger

66  

8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be  terminated and the Offer
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time
by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if:

 

 

(a) the board of directors of  the Company shall have made a Change in
Recommendation (regardless of whether such Change in Recommendation was
permitted under _Section 6.2(f)_ or _6.2(h)_ );

 

 

(b) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made  by the Company in this Agreement, such that the conditions

(i)       thirty (30) days following written notice to the Company from
Parent of such breach or failure and (ii) the date that is three (3) Business
Days prior to the Termination Date; provided that Parent shall not have  the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_ if Parent

right  to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ ; or

 

 

(c) the Offer (as extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(d)(i)_ ) expires or

satisfied if the Offer Acceptance Time were to then occur), and (ii) the
Minimum Condition having not been satisfied, in each case, without the
acceptance for payment of any Shares thereunder; provided that Parent  shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.4(c)_ if Parent is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement such that the Company
has  a valid right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_.

 

 

8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Offer and Merger pursuant to  this _Article VIII_ , this
Agreement (other than as set forth in this _Section 8.5_ and in _Section 9.1_
) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any
party hereto (or of any of its respective  Representatives); provided,
subject to _Section 9.8(b)_ that no such termination shall relieve (i) the
Company from any liability for damages resulting from any Willful Breach by
such party prior to such  termination, (ii) the Company from any obligation
to pay, if applicable, the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.5(b)_ or _Section 8.5(c)_ , or (iii) Parent from  any obligation to pay, if
applicable, the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.5(d)_.

 

 

 

67  

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.4(a)_   (Change in Recommendation), (ii) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_ (Termination for Superior Proposal) or (iii) by a Party
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ at such time  as this Agreement was terminable by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ , then the Company shall, within two (2)
Business Days after such termination in the case of _clause_ _(i)_ or
_clause  (iii)_ or concurrently with such termination in the case of _clause_
_(ii)_ , pay to Parent or its designee, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, a fee equal to $14,700,000 (the " _Company      
Termination Fee_ ").

 

 

(c) If (i) this Agreement is validly terminated (A)  by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ (Termination Date) prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ (Company Breach),
(ii)       prior to such termination but after the date of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly made to the
Company's stockholders generally or shall have otherwise been publicly
announced or become publicly known and (iii) within twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for any Acquisition Proposal (that is subsequently consummated) or
consummates any  Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay the Company
Termination Fee to Parent; provided that for purposes of this _Section 8.5(c)_
, references to "twenty (20%) or more" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed  to be references to "fifty percent (50%) or more".

 

 

(d) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant  to _Section 8.3(a)_ (Parent Breach) or _Section 8.3(c)_ (Failure to
Close), Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days  after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to
$29,400,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ").

 

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of  the Company
Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when
required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ , shall not constitute a
penalty but will be liquidated damages, and that the amount thereof is a 
reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such funds in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this  Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Offer and
Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
either the Company be required  to pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent
be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee or any portion thereof, as the
case may be, on more than one occasion.

 

 

(f) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.5_ are  an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, no party would have entered
into this Agreement.

 

 

 

68  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the proviso in _Section 8.5(a)_   and _Section 9.13_ , in any circumstance in
which this Agreement is terminated and Parent has the right to receive payment
of the Company Termination Fee, the payment of the Company Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of  Parent and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, the Financing  Sources, the
Guarantors, representatives, agents or any their respective heirs, assignees
or successors or any former, current or future general or limited partner,
stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer,
employee,  Affiliate, representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of
the foregoing (the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") against the Company, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or
future general  or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons,
managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
representatives, agents or any their respective heirs, assignees or successors
or any former, current or future general or  limited partner, stockholder,
controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of the foregoing
(collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss or  damage
suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other
document  delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any
representation (oral or otherwise) made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of
the Company Related Parties  shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment  Letter, without limiting the last sentence of this _Section
8.5(h)_ , in the event that this Agreement is terminated, the Company's right
(if any) to receive the payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy  of the Company and any other Person against the
Parent Related Parties, and no Parent Related Party shall have any other
liability for any or all losses suffered or incurred by the Company or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement  (and the termination hereof),
the Offer, the Merger (and the abandonment of the Offer and the Merger), any
matter with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, any matter
forming the basis for such termination or any breach (including  any Willful
Breach) of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, and
neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Parent or any other
Parent  Related Party arising out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any matters forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and
the payment of the  Parent Termination Fee (in each case in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement), under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any
money damages, including all or any  portion of the Parent Termination Fee or
receive any monetary damages other than the Parent Termination Fee when
payable hereunder.

70  

(b) Subject to _Section 9.5(c)_ , each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware in  the event any of any dispute arising out of or related
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion  or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it
will not, and waives any right to, bring any Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity (each, an " _Action_ ") relating to or arising  out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court
other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware,  and (iv) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such Action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal  court
located in the State of Delaware or that such Action was brought in an
inconvenient forum and agrees not to plead or claim the same. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that and consents to service of
any process,  summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.6_ shall be effective service of
process for any Action in connection with this Agreement or  the transactions

and determined in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New

thereof). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
of  the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding

court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in New York. Each of the parties further agrees
that delivery of notice by registered mail pursuant to _Section      
9.6_ shall constitute sufficient service of process with respect to any action
or proceeding involving a Financing Source or related to the Debt Commitment
Letters and the parties further waive any argument that such service is 
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding involving any Financing
Source arising out of  or relating to this Agreement, any Debt Commitment
Letter or the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the courts  in New York as described herein for any reason, (ii) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of 
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of

action or proceeding in any such  court is brought in an inconvenient forum,

Company  Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein and therein  constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede any and all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

 

 

73  

9.8 _No        Third-Party Beneficiaries; Non-Recourse_.

 

 

(a) This Agreement is not intended to, and does not and shall not be deemed
to, confer upon any Person other than the  parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, other than (i) as provided in _Section 6.11_
(Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance), (ii) the right of the
Company's stockholders to receive the Offer Price after the Offer Acceptance
Time or Merger Consideration after the Closing, as applicable, (iii) the right
of the  holders of equity awards of the Company to receive such consideration
as provided for in _Section 4.5_ after the Closing, (iv) this _Section 9.8_ ,
_Section 8.5(g)_ (Liability of Company Related Parties), _Section 8.5(h)_
(Liability of Parent Related Parties), _Section 9.2 (_ Modification or
Amendment)  and _Section 9.5_ (Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial)
which, to the extent applicable to the Company Related Parties or Parent
Related Parties, are intended to benefit and be  enforceable by the Company
Related Parties and Parent Related Parties (as applicable) and (v) the
Financing Sources shall be a third-party beneficiary of and entitled to
enforce, to the extent applicable to the  Lender, this _Section 9.8_ ,
_Section 9.2_ (Modification or Amendment), _Section 9.5_ (Governing Law and
Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial) and _Section       9.13(b)_ (Specific
Performance).

 

 

(b) This Agreement may be enforced only against the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub. All Proceedings (whether in  contract, tort, or equity, at law, or
granted by statute, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil or otherwise) that may
be based upon, arise under, out of, or relate in  any manner to (i) this
Agreement or any of the other agreements or documents contemplated hereby,
(ii) the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement or any of
the  documents contemplated hereby (including any representation or warranty
made in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the
other agreements or documents contemplated hereby), (iii) any  breach
(including Willful Breach) or violation of this Agreement (including the
failure of any representation and warranty to be true or accurate) or any of
the other Transaction Documents, and (iv) the Offer, the  Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, may be made only against (and
are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, and then only to the  extent of
the specific obligations of such Persons set forth in this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document, as applicable, and only by Persons that are party
to or are expressly identified as third party beneficiaries under this 
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to the extent permitted to
institute a Proceeding thereunder. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
Transaction  Documents to the contrary, the Company covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that, except to the extent such Person is a party to any of the
Transaction Documents, and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
of such parties set forth  in such Transaction Document, as applicable, no
recourse under this Agreement, any related document or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any related
document shall be had against any Parent Related  Party and neither the
Company nor any Person acting on its behalf shall assert a claim or institute
a Proceeding that is not a Retained Claim (as defined in the Limited
Guarantee). For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly agreed and 
understood by the Parties that nothing contained in this _Section 9.8(b)_
shall limit the Company's remedies under _Section 9.13_ , as a third party
beneficiary under the Equity Commitment Letter(s), or under the Limited
Guarantee  against the Guarantors on the terms and subject to the limitations
set forth therein.

 

 

 

74  

9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a  Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any  action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to cause such  Subsidiary to take such action.

 

 

9.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and in  the event any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitral
panel finds any provision hereof to be invalid or unenforceable, such
invalidity or enforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the other provisions hereof so long  as the economic, risk allocation,

or  obligations of the parties hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without

or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, from time to time, to (a) one  or more of its
Affiliates, or (b) to any parties providing secured debt financing, solely for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning this 
Agreement as collateral in respect of such secured debt financing, and (c)
after the Effective Time to any Person _, provided_ that no such assignment
shall impede  or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
otherwise impede the rights of the Company under this Agreement. No assignment
by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the  immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment in violation of this  _Section 9.12_ shall be null and void ab

9.13 _Specific        Performance_.

 

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have  any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of
the parties to this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary  damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of 
this Agreement by the other parties, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of proving actual harm or
damages or posting a bond or other security therefor, this being in addition
to any  other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and
each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other
party has an adequate  remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior  to the Closing, each party
shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants
required to be performed by the other parties under this Agreement 
(including _Section 6.5_ , and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the Closing when required hereunder and
to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including _Article I_ and
_Article       IV_ ) in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity and in accordance with this Agreement. Each
party further agrees that it shall not take any position in any legal
proceeding concerning this Agreement  that is contrary to the terms of this
_Section 9.13_.

 

 

 

76  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.13(a)_ and subject to the last sentence of this
_Section        9.13(b)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance of Parent's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter to fund the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and consummate the Closing only in the event that (i) all of the Offer
Conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied  by actions taken at or immediately prior to the
consummation of the Offer, each of which would be satisfied if the Offer
Acceptance Time were to then occur) at the time the Offer Acceptance Time
would have otherwise occurred pursuant to _Section       1.1(g)(ii)_ ,
(ii) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if
Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with _Section 6.15(e)_ ,
pursuant to the Alternative Financing  Commitments with respect thereto) has
been funded or an agent of the Lender(s) and the Purchaser(s) has confirmed in
writing to Parent that such financing will be funded at or prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time if the Equity Financing is funded  at or prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that it is ready,
willing and able to, and will, cause the Offer Closing and Closing to occur in
accordance with the terms of  this Agreement if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded and (iv) Merger
Sub shall have failed to accept for payment in accordance with _Section
1.1(g)(ii)_ all  Class A Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and
not properly withdrawn or to consummate the Merger within two (2) Business
Days of the receipt of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Company or any of its  successors or permitted assigns be entitled
to (x) enforce or seek to enforce specifically the remedy of specific
performance of any Debt Commitment Letter against any Financing Source, (y) be
entitled to  specifically enforce (or to bring any Proceeding in equity
seeking to specifically enforce) Parent's rights under the Equity Commitment
Letter to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the Closing
other than as expressly  provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or
(z) seek to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement or to obtain
an injunction or injunctions, or to bring any other Proceeding in equity in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, against any
person other than against Parent and, in such case and solely with respect to
the Proceedings described in this clause (z), only under the circumstances
expressly set forth in _Section 9.13(a)_   and this _Section 9.13(b)_.

 

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' right to  seek specific performance
pursuant to this _Section 9.13_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the
Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and/or
pursue payment of the Parent Termination Fee after the  valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.5(d)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be entitled
to the Parent Termination Fee if they have been granted specific  performance
of this Agreement, the Closing actually occurs and Parent makes all of the
payments contemplated by _Article IV_ hereof and unless this Agreement has
been validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.5(d)_.

condition in _clause (a)_ below has not been satisfied by one minute after
11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date  or (y) any of the
conditions set forth in _clauses (b)_ through _(i)_ below shall not be
satisfied or waived in writing by Parent

 

 

(a) the number of Shares validly tendered and, "received" by the

pursuant to  guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered
in satisfaction of such guarantee in accordance with Section 251(h) of the
DGCL), together with any Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, equals at least one Share more than a majority of
all issued and outstanding Shares as of the Expiration Time (the " _Minimum
Condition_ ");

 

 

(b) No Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,

subject only to inaccuracies that would not increase the total of the
aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1_ ,  the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 4.2_ and the aggregate
amounts payable to former holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to
_Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.5_ (calculated assuming there are no  Dissenting
Shares) by more than three million Dollars ($3,000,000) relative to if such
representations and warranties were true and correct in all respects, as of
the date of the Agreement and at the Offer Acceptance Time (in each case
except  to the extent that any such representation and warranty speaks as of
a particular date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be
true and correct as of such earlier date), (ii) the representations  and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 5.1(f)(i)_ (Absence of Certain
Changes) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and at the Offer Acceptance  Time, (iii) the representation and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_ (Corporate Authority
and Approval) and _Section_ _5.1(t)_ (Brokers and Finders) shall be true and

Offer Acceptance Time, (iv) the other representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 5.1_ shall be true and correct as of the date of
the Agreement and at the Offer Acceptance Time (except to the extent that
any  such representation and warranty speaks as of a particular date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of
such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties of the Company  to be so true and correct (read for purposes of
_clause_ _(iii)_ and _this clause_ _(iv)_ without giving effect to any
"materiality," " _Company Material Adverse  Effect_ " or similar
qualification therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and
(v) Parent and Merger Sub shall have  received a certificate of the Company,
validly executed for and on behalf of the Company and in its name by a duly
authorized executive officer thereof, to the foregoing effect.

required to be performed by it under the  Agreement at or prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time and shall not have failed to comply with any covenant or
agreement of the Company hereunder at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
and Parent and Merger Sub shall have received a certificate  of the Company,
validly executed for and on behalf of the Company and in its name by a duly
authorized executive officer thereof, to the foregoing effect;

 

 

(f) the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Transactions
under the HSR Act shall have expired or been  earlier terminated;

 

 

(g) the Founder Exchange and Tender shall have occurred prior to the
Expiration Date and no party (other than Parent) shall have breached in any 
material respect any of its obligations under, or terminated or repudiated,
the Exchange Agreement;

 

 

(h) after the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Change
that, individually or taken together with  any other Changes, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and

be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.
