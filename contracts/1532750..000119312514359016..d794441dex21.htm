ARTICLE V

 

PURCHASERS DUE DILIGENCE

 

5.1 General. Purchaser shall have the right to inspect at the offices of
Seller in Dallas, Texas, seven days a week, upon reasonable advance notice to
Seller, copies or originals (as determined by Seller) of all files, records
and data related to the Assets that are in the possession of Seller; provided,
that access to certain of such files, records and data may be made
available on a website created for such purpose. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be under any obligation to furnish Purchaser any
data or information which is subject to third-party restrictions (provided
that Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to disclose such data or information to Seller, provided
further that Seller will have no obligation to provide consideration in
exchange for such consent unless Purchaser agrees to reimburse Seller for
such consideration) or attorney-client privilege (other than title opinions).
Purchaser shall also have the right to make or perform at any reasonable
time(s), at its own risk, cost and expense, inspections of the
Assets, including the well sites, equipment and facilities included therein;
provided, however, that Purchaser must make previous arrangements with Seller
for each such inspection; and provided, further, that each such inspection
shall be limited to a visual inspection of the Assets, it being understood
that no sampling or other invasive inspections thereof may be conducted
without Sellers prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld). PURCHASER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER AND ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS,
CAUSES OF ACTION, INJURIES TO PURCHASERS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS,
SUBCONTRACTORS OR INVITEES OR TO PURCHASERS PROPERTY, AND/OR INJURY TO
SELLERS PROPERTY, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS WHICH MAY ARISE OUT
OF PURCHASERS INSPECTIONS REGARDLESS OF SELLERS NEGLIGENCE OR FAULT
(INCLUDING THOSE CLAIMS RESULTING FROM THE SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT),
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER OR ANY OF SELLERS
REPRESENTATIVES). The foregoing indemnity shall continue in full force and
effect notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Purchaser

 



22  agrees to provide to Seller, immediately upon request, a copy of any and all
environmental assessments of the Assets conducted by or on behalf of
Purchaser, including any reports, data, and conclusions, and to maintain the
confidentiality of the information set forth therein until the Closing except
to the extent disclosure is required under applicable law. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated, Purchaser agrees to continue to maintain the
confidentiality of such information (irrespective of the termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement) except to the extent disclosure is required under
applicable Law. Purchaser agrees to comply with the rules, regulations
and instructions issued by Seller regarding the actions of Purchaser and its
agents while upon, entering or leaving the Assets.

5.2 Title Matters. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.1, Seller
shall make available to Purchaser at the offices of Seller in Dallas, Texas at
all reasonable times prior to the Closing and upon reasonable advance notice
to Seller such title files, land files, title opinions and other title data
as Seller has in its possession pertaining to the Assets.

5.3 Title Defects. In the event Purchaser discovers a Title Defect that it
intends to assert hereunder, Purchaser shall notify Seller in good faith of
such Title Defect as soon after such Title Defect is discovered as is
reasonably practicable, and in any event, on or before the Title Defect
Notice Date. Each such notice shall set forth Purchasers basis for the
assertion of such Title Defect (including supporting documentation and
calculations therefor), Purchasers requirement(s) to cure such Title Defect
and Purchasers proposed Title Defect Value thereof (each such notice, a
"Title Defect Notice"). Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

 

(a) Purchaser may not assert any Title Defect after the Title Defect Notice
Date;

 

(b) this Article V sets forth Purchasers sole remedy for Title Defects
(including any breach of a representation and warranty set forth in Article
III that would also constitute a Title Defect), other than (without
duplication of recovery) Sellers limited warranty as to title contained in
the ARP Assignment and AGP Assignment;

 

(c) Purchaser may only assert a Title Defect pursuant to a timely Title Defect
Notice;

 

(d) an individual Title Defect shall not qualify as such unless the Title
Defect Value thereof exceeds the Individual Deductible Amount (any individual
Title Defect with a Title Defect Value exceeding the Individual Deductible
Amount being referred to herein as a "Qualified Title Defect" and the amount
by which the Title Defect Value of a Qualified Title Defect exceeds the
Individual Deductible Amount being referred to herein as the "Qualified Title
Defect Value");

 

(e) the Purchase Price will only be adjusted for one or more Qualified Title
Defects and Qualified Environmental Defects to the extent that the cumulative
amount of Qualified Title Defect Values and Qualified Environmental Defect
Values thereof exceeds the Aggregate Deductible Amount.

 

5.4 Remedies for Title Defects. Upon timely delivery of a Title Defect Notice,
Purchaser and Seller shall meet and use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree on the validity of such Title Defect and, if valid, the Title Defect
Value thereof. Subject to Section 5.3(e), if

 



23  Purchaser and Seller agree prior to the Closing on the Title Defect Value
and Seller does not cure such Title Defect prior to Closing, then the Asset
affected by such Title Defect shall, at Sellers election, either (i) be
conveyed by Seller to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted by the Qualified Title Defect Value, (ii) be excluded from the
transactions contemplated hereby, in which event the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value thereof, or (iii) be the subject of Sellers
further attempts to cure in accordance with Section 5.5. If, prior to Closing,
Purchaser and Seller have not agreed on the validity of one or more Title
Defects asserted in accordance with this Article V or on the Title Defect
Value(s) thereof or on whether one or more Title Defects has been cured to the
reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser prior to Closing, then the Parties shall
submit such Title Defect to arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Section
5.8. If Seller elects to attempt to cure one or more Title Defects then Seller
may, upon notice to Purchaser, delay the Closing Date for a period of up
to twenty (20) Business Days in the event that Seller believes in good faith
that it can cure any such Title Defect within such extended period.

 

5.5 Curative Provisions. The following shall apply with respect to each Title
Defect that Seller attempts to cure pursuant to Section 5.4(iii) (each a
"Subject Defect"):

(a) The Assets affected by each Subject Defect shall be conveyed by Seller to
Purchaser at the Closing (unless the Subject Defect is a Material Consent).

(b) Seller shall have a one hundred (100) day period after (i) the Closing
with respect to Subject Defects within which to attempt to cure such Subject
Defects provided, that, in each case, if Sellers curative efforts with
respect to a Subject Defect require the initiation of proceedings before a
Governmental Authority, such one hundred (100) day period with respect thereto
shall be extended for so long as such proceedings are diligently pursued by
Seller until such proceedings are concluded pursuant to a final, non-
appealable judgment or are otherwise finally resolved, such extension not to
exceed the Final Payment Date (the applicable cure period being hereinafter
referred to as the "Cure Period"). Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller,
at Sellers sole cost and expense, in connection with its curative efforts,
including in connection with any proceedings before a Governmental Authority.

 

(c) In the event that Seller believes in good faith that it has cured a
Subject Defect within the Cure Period, Seller shall submit such curative
efforts to Purchaser for approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved such curative efforts in
the event Purchaser does not notify Seller of its objection to the same (and
the reasons therefor) within fifteen (15) Business Days after Purchasers
receipt thereof. In the event Purchaser so objects, Seller shall have an
additional period of ten (10) Business Days within which to perform
additional curative efforts to satisfy Purchasers objections (and the Cure
Period applicable thereto shall be extended accordingly). In any event: (i)
except with respect to curative efforts that Purchaser has been deemed to have
approved, each Party retains the right to dispute whether or not a Subject
Defect has been cured and whether or not a Subject Defect constitutes a Title
Defect, and (ii) any such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 5.8, which dispute
resolution procedures must be initiated on or before fifteen (15) Business
Days after the end of the Cure Period.

 



24 (d) With respect to each Subject Defect that has neither been cured
to Purchasers reasonable satisfaction prior to the expiration of the Cure
Period or waived by Purchaser, the Purchase Price and the Final Payment amount
shall each be reduced by the Qualified Title Defect Values of the affected
Assets, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.3. With respect to
each Subject Defect that has been cured in accordance with the provisions
hereof prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, there shall be no reduction
to the Purchase Price or the Final Payment amount with respect thereto.

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding: if as a result
of Sellers curative efforts and/or successful resolution of Title Defects
pursuant to Section 5.8, the amount by which the Purchase Price is adjusted on
account of Title Defects is reduced below the Aggregate Deductible Amount
applicable thereto, Purchaser shall pay to Seller any amounts by which the
Purchase Price was reduced on account of Title Defects and Environmental
Defects to the extent such amounts have been deducted from amounts previously
paid to Seller.

 

5.6 Interest Additions.

 

(a) If at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Title Defect Notice
Date, Seller has knowledge that any Net Revenue Interest in an Asset is
greater than that shown on Exhibit A, Schedule 1B for such Asset (an "Interest
Addition"), Seller may request an upward adjustment in the Purchase Price by
notifying Purchaser of an Interest Addition. Any such notice shall set forth
Sellers basis for the assertion of such Interest Addition and Sellers
proposed upward adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.

 

(b) Upon timely delivery of a notice by Seller of an Interest Addition,
Purchaser and Seller shall meet and use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree on the validity thereof and the amount of any required adjustment to the
Purchase Price. If Purchaser and Seller agree prior to the Closing on the
validity of one or more Interest Additions asserted in accordance with this
Article V and on the amount of an adjustment to the Purchase Price on account
thereof, with respect to each such Interest Addition, then at Closing the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the amount of such agreed upon adjustment.
If, prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller have not agreed on the
validity of one or more Interest Additions asserted in accordance with this
Article V or on the amount of an adjustment to the Purchase Price on account
thereof, with respect to each such Interest Addition, Purchaser may elect to
(i) exclude the Assets affected by one or more of such Interest Additions from
the transactions contemplated hereby, in which event the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Values thereof, or (ii) submit the dispute(s)
with respect to Interest Additions to arbitration pursuant to the provisions
of Section 5.8.

 



25 5.7 Environmental Defects.

 

(a) In the event Purchaser discovers an Environmental Defect, Purchaser shall
in good faith give notice thereof to Seller as soon after such Environmental
Defect is discovered as is reasonably practicable, and in any event, on or
before the Environmental Notice Date. Each notice of an Environmental Defect
shall set forth Purchasers reasonable good faith estimate of the
Environmental Defect Value of such Environmental Defect (and the calculation
thereof) and must describe such Environmental Defect in sufficient, specific
detail, including: the written conclusion of Purchaser (or its consultant)
that an Environmental Defect exists; the provisions of Environmental Laws
causing the condition to constitute an Environmental Defect and the facts that
substantiate such violation; identification of the Asset affected by such
Environmental Defect; and identification of the procedures recommended to
correct such Environmental Defect (each, an "Environmental Defect Notice").

 

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall, after each Environmental Defect Notice is
delivered, meet and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the
validity thereof and the amount of any required adjustment to the Purchase
Price, it being understood that the amount of any such adjustment with respect
to an Environmental Defect will be the Qualified Environmental Defect Value
(as defined below), with the "Environmental Defect Value" being the lesser of
the following: (i) the cost of correcting the Environmental Defect (net to
Sellers Working Interest therein) in compliance with Environmental Laws in a
commercially reasonable manner and assuming that the affected Asset will
continue to be used as an oil and gas property or (ii) the Allocated Value of
the affected Asset.

 

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

 

(i) Purchaser may not assert any Environmental Defect after the Environmental
Notice Date;

 

(ii) Purchaser may not recover under the indemnity provisions in Section 10.8
to the extent that any Environmental Defects are resolved under this Article
V and for any Environmental Defects which Purchaser discovers but does not
provide an Environmental Defect Notice to Seller as required herein;

 

(iii) Purchaser may only assert an Environmental Defect pursuant to a timely
Environmental Defect Notice;

 

(iv) an individual Environmental Defect shall not qualify as such unless the
Environmental Defect Value thereof exceeds the Individual Deductible Amount
(any individual Environmental Defect with an Environmental Defect Value
exceeding the Individual Deductible Amount being referred to herein as a
"Qualified Environmental Defect" and the amount by which the Environmental
Defect Value of a Qualified Environmental Defect exceeds the Individual
Deductible Amount being referred to herein as the "Qualified Environmental
Defect Value"); and

 



26 (v) the Purchase Price will only be adjusted for one or more Qualified
Title Defects and Qualified Environmental Defects to the extent that the
cumulative amount of Qualified Title Defect Values and Qualified Environmental
Defect Values thereof exceeds the Aggregate Deductible Amount.

 

(d) Subject to Section 5.7(c)(v) above, if Purchaser and Seller agree on the
Environmental Defect Value and Seller does not cure such Environmental Defect
to Purchasers reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing, then the Asset
affected by such Environmental Defect shall, at Purchasers election, either
be (i) conveyed by Seller to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted by the Qualified Environmental Defect Value, or (ii)
excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value thereof. If, prior
to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller have not agreed on the validity of one
or more Environmental Defects asserted in accordance with this Section 5.7 or
on the amount of the Environmental Defect Values thereof or on whether one or
more Environmental Defects has been cured to the reasonable satisfaction of
Purchaser prior to Closing, with respect to each such Environmental Defect,
then the Parties shall submit such Environmental Defects to arbitration
pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.8.

5.8 Arbitration Disputes with respect to Title Defects or Interest Additions
(collectively, "Title Disputes") shall be submitted for resolution in
accordance with this Section 5.8 to an attorney with at least ten (10) years
of experience in oil and gas title matters, and disputes with respect to
Environmental Defects ("Environmental Disputes") shall be submitted for
resolution in accordance with this Section 5.8 to an attorney with at least
ten (10) years of experience in oil and gas environmental matters (in each
case, the "Arbitrator"). Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree upon an
Arbitrator. In the event that Seller and Purchaser are not able to agree on an
Arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which either Party
determines to submit a Title Dispute or Environmental Dispute to arbitration,
either Seller or Purchaser may request that the American Arbitration
Association appoint the Arbitrator. The fees and expenses of any Arbitrator
shall be paid by Seller and/or Purchaser, as determined by the Arbitrator.
Each of Seller and Purchaser shall submit a written statement of its position
to the Arbitrator with respect to the Title Dispute or Environmental Dispute
(as applicable) not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
Arbitrator is appointed. The Arbitrator shall render his or her decision
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Arbitrator is appointed. The
decision of the Arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding on Seller and
Purchaser and shall be enforceable against any Party in a court of competent
jurisdiction. Anything in this Section 5.8 or the other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that all Title
Disputes and Environmental Disputes have not been resolved prior to the
Closing by arbitration or otherwise: (a) the Assets affected by such
unresolved Title Defects and Environmental Defects shall be conveyed to
Purchaser at the Closing; and (b) as each such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect is resolved by the Arbitrator or by agreement of Purchaser and Seller,
the Purchase Price and the Final Payment amount shall each be reduced to the
extent and in the amount of any resolutions in favor of Purchaser. In
connection with any determination of an Environmental Dispute by an Arbitrator
pursuant to this Section 5.8, it is understood that the Environmental Defect
Value of an Environmental Defect may not exceed the amount thereof asserted
in the Environmental Defect Notice with respect thereto.

 



27 5.9 Consents to Assignment

 

(a) From the date hereof until six (6) months after the Closing Date, Seller
shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts, and shall incur and pay all
costs and expenses in connection therewith, to obtain all Third-Party Consents
applicable to the assignment or transfer of any of the Assets (each a "Consent
to Assign"), which are required in connection with the assignment of any
Assets to Purchaser. SELLER SHALL NOT include in the ARP Assignment or the AGP
Assignment (or permit the Operator to include in any Assignment by Operator)
at Closing any Asset (or part thereof) that is subject to a Consent to Assign
which provides that the transfer of the Asset without consent or waiver shall
or may result in (i) a termination of any rights in relation to the affected
Asset or (ii) a termination of the assignment thereof, as to the affected
Asset or otherwise (a "Material Consent") in the event that such Material
Consent has not been satisfied (or otherwise rendered of no further force and
effect) as of the Closing.

 

(b) In the event that a Material Consent has not been satisfied (or otherwise
rendered of no force or effect) prior to Closing, the Asset (or portion
thereof) affected thereby shall be deemed to be subject to a Title Defect and
excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby and the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of the excluded portion of
the affected Asset; provided, however, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy (or cause to be satisfied) such Material Consent
within six (6) months of Closing. If such Material Consent is so satisfied,
Seller shall give notice to Purchaser as soon as possible after Seller learns
that such Material Consent has been satisfied, but in no event later than six
(6) months after the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall have the obligation to
purchase the Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such Material Consent
from Seller and Seller shall have the obligation to sell such Asset (or
portion thereof) to Purchaser for the Allocated Value thereof, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as if the transaction had occurred at
Closing. In the event such Material Consent with respect to any Asset (or
portion thereof) is not satisfied within six (6) months after the Closing
Date, then Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, proceed with a closing on
such affected Asset (or portion thereof) in which case Purchaser shall be
deemed to have waived any objection (and shall be obligated to indemnify
Seller for all Claims) with respect to non-compliance with such Material
Consent with respect to such affected Asset (or portion thereof). In the
event that a Consent to Assign is not a Material Consent, such Consent to
Assign shall not constitute a Title Defect and the Asset subject to such
Consent to Assign will be assigned to Purchaser at Closing without any
adjustment to the Purchase Price on account of such Consent to Assign.

(c) In the event that the Consent to Assign applicable to the Precision
Contract has not been satisfied (or otherwise rendered of no force or effect)
prior to Closing, the following shall occur with respect to the Precision
Contract until such time as the Consent to Assign applicable thereto is
satisfied (or otherwise rendered of no force or effect) and the Precision
Contract is conveyed to Purchaser: (i) Cinco shall remain a party to the
Precision Contract as nominee for Purchaser; (ii) Purchaser shall be
responsible for all liabilities and obligations with respect to the Precision
Contract as if Purchaser were a party to the Precision Contract as of the
Closing Date; and (iii) Cinco shall act as Purchasers nominee but shall
be authorized to act only upon and in accordance with the Transition Services
Agreement or Purchasers written instructions,

 



28  and Seller shall have no authority, responsibility, liability or discretion
to perform any tasks or functions with respect to the Precision Contract other
than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in nature, unless
otherwise specifically authorized under the Transition Services Agreement or
otherwise requested and authorized by Purchaser in writing.

ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of
Hydrocarbons therefrom shall be prorated among Buyer and Seller in accordance
with Sections 8.2 and 8.7. Each party will timely file such Tax Returns and
pay the amounts due thereon. To the extent provisions of this Agreement
apportion or otherwise allocate responsibility for the Taxes on a Tax Return,
the party paying such Taxes shall be promptly reimbursed by the other party
for such other partys share of such Taxes. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate and (at the expense of the requesting party) provide to each other
such information and assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection
with (i) the preparation of any Tax Return relating to the Assets, (ii) the
conduct of any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority relating to
any liability for Taxes relating to the Assets, and (iii) the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return relating
to the Assets.

 

6.2 Purchasers Qualification. At Closing, Purchaser shall be qualified and
shall meet all requirements, including bonding requirements, to be designated
operator of that portion of the Assets for which Operator serves as operator.

6.3 Additional Arrangements. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the Parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all action and
shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable
under any applicable Laws or under applicable governing agreements to

including using reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents
and approvals and effecting all necessary registrations and filings. Each of
the Parties shall take, or cause to be taken, all action or shall do, or cause

covenants and conditions applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby
to be performed or satisfied as soon as practicable.

otherwise makes any public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no Party shall issue any press release or
make any such public statement prior to obtaining the approval of the other
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that such approval
shall not be required where such release or announcement is required to be
made by a Party under applicable law (provided any such statement shall be
provided to the other Party concurrently with its release). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall not identify Seller by name
in any press release or public statement, unless required under applicable
law.

 



30 6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller shall give prompt notice to
Purchaser of Sellers Knowledge prior to the Closing of (a) any
representation or warranty contained in Article III being untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect when made, or (b) the occurrence of any event or
development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any
representation or warranty contained in Article III to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall give prompt
notice to Seller of Purchasers Knowledge prior to the Closing of (w) any
representation or warranty contained in Article IV being untrue or inaccurate

development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any
representation or warranty contained in Article IV to be untrue or inaccurate

pursuant to this Section 6.5, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement
the Schedules hereto or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, or breach of covenant.

6.6 Payment of Expenses. Each Party shall pay its own expenses incident to
preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not Closing
occurs.

 

6.7 Transition Services Agreement. Upon Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall
enter into the Transition Services Agreement concerning operation of the
Assets following Closing.

6.8 Audit Rights. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Purchaser and make available to Purchaser and its

Closing any and all existing financial statements and other information and
documents relating to revenues and expenses attributable to the Assets and in
the possession of Seller that Purchaser may reasonably require to comply with
Purchasers tax and financial reporting requirements and audits, including any
filings with any Governmental Authority and filings that may be required by
the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and/or
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sellers cooperation will include (a)
reasonable access to Sellers employees and representatives designated by
Seller who were responsible for preparing or maintaining the revenue and
expense records and work papers and other supporting documents used in the
preparation of such financial statements and other documents as may
be reasonably required by Purchasers independent auditors to perform an
audit or conduct a review in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards or to otherwise verify such financial statements and other
documents; and (b) delivery of one or more customary representation letters
from Seller to Purchasers independent auditors that are reasonably requested

paid, reimburse Seller, within ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor,
for any reasonable out-of-pocket and overhead costs incurred by Seller in
complying with the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall expand Sellers representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates or
any third party any rights to which it is not entitled hereunder.

CLOSING

8.1 Time and Place of the Closing. If the conditions referred to in Article
VII have been satisfied or waived in writing, the Closing shall take place at
the offices of Cinco located in Dallas, Texas at 10:00 a.m. (Prevailing
Central Time) on the Closing Date. Time is of the essence in the performance
of this Agreement. All events of Closing shall each be deemed to have occurred
simultaneously with the other, regardless of when actually occurring, and each
shall be a condition precedent to the other. If the Closing occurs, all
conditions of Closing shall be deemed to have been satisfied or waived (but
Sellers and Purchasers representations and warranties shall not be waived
and shall survive the Closing subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement). In no event shall Closing be deemed to have occurred prior to the
time that Seller has confirmed receipt of the amounts contemplated by Sections
8.9(a) and 8.9(b).

 

8.2 Allocation of Costs and Expenses and Adjustments to Purchase Price at the
Closing.

 

(a) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the following
amounts:

 

(i) the amount of all (A) paid ad valorem, property, production or similar
Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership of the Assets or the production
of Hydrocarbons therefrom, insofar as such Taxes relate

 



33  to periods of time from and after the Effective Time, and (B) paid charges,
costs and expenses of any kind or nature that are attributable to the Assets
and the period from and after the Effective Time;

(ii) all expenses, including operating and capital expenditures, incurred and
paid by or on behalf of Seller in connection with ownership, operation and
use of the Assets attributable to the period from and after the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, those incurred in the performance of the
operations set forth on Schedule 6.1; 

(iii) all royalties, rentals, insurance premiums (including property and
business interruption coverage) and other charges attributable to the Assets
for the period of from and after the Effective Time to the extent paid by or
on behalf of Seller (the costs and expenses for which Seller shall receive an
upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii)
inclusive, shall be referred to as the "Interim Operating Expenses");

(iv) the value of all merchantable oil, gas and natural gas liquids in
storage or in the pipelines as of the Effective Time that is credited to the
Assets (the "Inventory"), such value to be the actual price received for such
oil, gas or natural gas liquids upon the first sale thereof, or absent a
sale, then such value shall be based upon the average market price posted in
the area for oil, gas or natural gas liquids of similar quality and grade in
effect as of the Effective Time less all applicable royalties, production and
ad valorem Taxes, gravity adjustments and transportation expenses necessary to
market such production, provided that Seller and Purchaser will accept
Sellers tank gauge readings, meter tickets or other inventory records of the
Inventory as of the time of Sellers measurement thereof on July 1, 2014, for
the purposes of determining the volume of the Inventory as of the Effective
Time under this Agreement; and

 

(v) any other amount agreed upon in writing by Purchaser and Seller.

 

(b) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the following
amounts:

 

(i) an amount equal to the sales price (net of applicable severance and
production Taxes) paid by the first purchaser of the Hydrocarbons produced,
saved and sold from the Subject Interests from the Effective Time to the
Closing Date, which Purchase Price Allocations and Adjustments shall (A) for
purposes of the pre-Closing Statement, be based upon actual amounts,
if available, and upon such estimates as are reasonably agreed upon by the
Parties, to the extent actual amounts are not known at Closing, and (B) for
purposes of the Final Settlement Statement, be based upon actual amounts; and

 

(ii) any other amount agreed upon in writing by Purchaser and Seller.

 

(c) The allocations of costs and expenses and/or adjustments described in
Sections 8.2(a) and (b) are referred to herein as the "Purchase Price
Allocations and Adjustments."

 



34 8.3 Closing Adjustments and Allocations Statement. On or before the
third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a statement of the estimated Purchase Price Allocations
and Adjustments and the resulting Closing Date Purchase Price
(the "Statement"), which Statement shall be based upon the then most
currently available data and information in order to make the adjustments as
provided in Section 8.2.

 

8.4 Post-Closing Allocations and Adjustments to Purchase Price.

 

(a) On or before ninety (90) Business Days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a revised Statement ("Final Settlement
Statement") setting forth the actual Purchase Price Allocations and
Adjustments. Each Party shall provide the other such data and information as
may be reasonably requested to permit Seller to prepare the Final Settlement
Statement or to permit Purchaser to perform or cause to be performed an audit
of the Final Settlement Statement. The Final Settlement Statement shall become
final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) Business Day
following receipt thereof by Purchaser (the "Final Settlement Date") unless
Purchaser gives notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to
Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the dollar amount and the nature and basis of any
disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in
a timely manner, then the Parties shall resolve the dispute evidenced by the
Notice of Disagreement by mutual agreement, or otherwise in accordance with
Section 8.4(b).

(b) If Purchaser and Seller have not agreed on the Final Settlement Statement
before the thirtieth (30th) Business Day after Purchasers delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, the Final Settlement Statement shall be determined by
the Designated Accountant. The Designated Accountants determination of the
Final Settlement Statement shall be conclusive. One-half (1/2) of the
Designated Accountants fees associated with the determination of the Final
Settlement Statement shall be paid by each Party. Purchaser and Seller shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the Designated Accountant to render a final
determination within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of such
submission.

 

(c) If the amount of the adjusted Closing Date Purchase Price as set forth on
the Final Settlement Statement exceeds the amount of the Closing Date
Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then Purchaser shall pay in immediately
available funds to Seller the amount by which the Closing Date Purchase Price
as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement exceeds the amount of
the Closing Date Purchase Price paid at the Closing. If the amount of the
adjusted Closing Date Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Settlement
Statement is less than the amount of the Closing Date Purchase Price paid at
the Closing, then Seller shall pay in immediately available funds to
Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Date Purchase Price as set forth on
the Final Settlement

 



35  Statement is less than the amount of the Closing Date Purchase Price paid at
the Closing. All such payments required to be made under this Section 8.4(c)
shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date
or, in the event a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Seller, within five
(5) Business Days after Seller and Purchaser mutually agree or the Designated
Accountant renders a determination on the Final Settlement Statement.

(d) Pursuant to Section 8.2(b), the Purchase Price is to be reduced by the
value of Hydrocarbons produced during the period from the Effective Time to
the Closing Date. If Purchaser shall receive any revenues attributable to such
Hydrocarbons for any reason, Purchaser shall promptly remit same in
immediately available funds to Seller. Likewise, if Seller shall for any
reason receive any of the proceeds of sale of Hydrocarbons produced and saved
from the Assets and attributable to the period from and after the Effective
Time or any other revenues attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Assets from and after the Effective Time, Seller shall promptly remit same in
immediately available funds to Purchaser.

 

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any costs and expenses,
including Taxes (other than Taxes on gross income, net income or gross
receipts) relating to the Assets which are not reflected in the Final
Settlement Statement shall be treated as follows:

 

(i) All costs and expenses relating to the Assets for which Seller is
responsible shall be the sole obligation of Seller and Seller shall promptly
pay, or if paid by Purchaser, promptly reimburse Purchaser in immediately
available funds for and indemnify, defend, and hold Purchaser harmless from
and against the same; and

 

(ii) All costs and expenses relating to the Assets for which Purchaser is
responsible shall be the sole obligation of Purchaser and Purchaser shall
promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller in immediately
available funds for and indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and
against the same.

 

8.5 Adjustments to Final Payment. The amount of the Final Payment shall be
decreased by (i) the Allocated Value of any Asset excluded from the purchase
and sale contemplated herein pursuant to the provisions of Article V, (ii) all
downward Purchase Price adjustments in connection with Title Defects and
Environmental Defects determined in accordance with Article V (without
duplication of any adjustment pursuant to Section 8.5(i) above) and (iii) all
upward Purchase Price adjustments in connection with Interest Additions
determined in accordance with Article V. On or before the fifteenth (15th)
Business Day prior to the date the Final Payment is due, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement of the estimated downward
adjustments and the resulting Final Payment. If after taking into account all
downward adjustments to and setoffs against the Final Payment, the result is
a negative Final Payment, such negative amount shall be (i) setoff against the
penultimate Deferred Purchase Price payment or (ii) to the extent not so
setoff by Purchaser, paid by Seller to Purchaser on the Final Payment Date.

 



36 8.6 Transfer Taxes. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
shall each be liable for 50% of all Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser
agree to cooperate in establishing that the requirements of any applicable
exemption from such Taxes have been satisfied.

 

8.7 Ad Valorem and Similar Taxes. Ad valorem, personal property and similar
Taxes imposed with respect to a period which begins before and ends on or
after the Effective Time (a "Straddle Period") shall be prorated based on the
number of days in such Straddle Period before and on or after the Effective
Time. Sellers share of such Taxes shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes
for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in such Straddle Period before the Effective Time, and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle
Period. Purchasers share of such Taxes shall be equal to the amount of such
Taxes for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period on or after the Effective Time
(with the Effective Time being included in the number of days after the
Effective Time), and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
the Straddle Period. If either Party pays such Taxes for which the other Party
is responsible, and the amount of such payment is not taken into account as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 8.2, then upon receipt of
evidence of payment the nonpaying Party will reimburse the paying Party
promptly for the nonpaying Partys share of such Taxes.

8.8 Actions of Seller at the Closing. At the Closing, Seller shall:

 

(a) execute, acknowledge and deliver to Purchaser an Assignment, Bill of Sale
and Conveyance in the form of Exhibit B-1 (the "ARP Assignment"), effective
as of the Effective Time, and such other conveyances, assignments, transfers,
bills of sale and other instruments (in form and substance mutually agreed

Closing Date or the date operations and accounting functions are transferred
to Purchaser;

 



37 (f) deliver to Purchaser possession of the Assets by delivering to ARP

(a) The ARP Assignment, the AGP Assignment and the Assignments by Operator
shall be without representation or warranty of title, express or implied,
except that Seller shall specially warrant and agree to defend the title to
the Assets against the lawful claims and demands of all persons claiming the
same, or any part thereof, but limited to claims arising by, through, or
under Seller but not otherwise, subject to and excepting all Permitted
Encumbrances. The damages recoverable for a breach of such special warranty of

termination.

9.3 Termination Damages. If all conditions precedent to the obligations

obligations hereunder or the breach of any representation in Article IV by
Purchaser, then in such event, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written
notice setting forth such failure or breach (a "Default Notice"). If Purchaser
shall not have cured such failure or breach, or the Closing shall not have
occurred, within three (3) days after Purchasers receipt of the Default
Notice, then Seller shall have the option to terminate this Agreement, in
which case Purchaser shall pay to Seller one percent (1%) of the Purchase
Price (the "Termination Fee") as liquidated damages on account of Purchasers
failure to perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement or
Purchasers breach of any representation in Article IV, which remedy shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy available to Seller for Purchasers failure to
perform or breach. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that (i)
Sellers actual damages upon the event of such a termination are difficult to
ascertain with any certainty, (ii) that the Termination Fee is a reasonable
estimate of such actual damages and (iii) such liquidated damages do not
constitute a penalty. Thereupon, this Agreement shall be null and void and no
Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement.

OF THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION ARE "CONSPICUOUS" DISCLAIMERS
FOR ALL PURPOSES. PURCHASER SPECIFICALLY REPRESENTS AND AGREES THAT IT IS NOT
RELYING UPON AND HAS NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES MADE BY SELLER IN ARTICLE III, IN THE ARP ASSIGNMENT AND THE AGP
ASSIGNMENT OR IN THE CERTIFICATE OF SELLER TO BE DELIVERED AT CLOSING PURSUANT
TO SECTION 7.2(a), AND BY OPERATOR IN THE ASSIGNMENTS BY OPERATOR. THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.1, TOGETHER WITH THE LIMITED REMEDIES PROVIDED
IN ARTICLE X, WERE SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED FOR BETWEEN PURCHASER AND SELLER AND
WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY PURCHASER AND SELLER IN ARRIVING AT THE PURCHASE
PRICE. PURCHASER 

 



49  ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER IS "CONSPICUOUS" AND
IS THE RESULT OF ARMS-LENGTH NEGOTIATION, THAT PURCHASER IS SOPHISTICATED AND
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT BUSINESS MATTERS AND WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, THAT
THIS DISCLAIMER IS NOT BOILERPLATE AND THAT THIS DISCLAIMER IS TO BE A CLEAR,
UNEQUIVOCAL AND EFFECTIVE DISCLAIMER OF RELIANCE UNDER TEXAS LAW.

 

11.2 NORM. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT OIL AND GAS
PRODUCING FORMATIONS CAN CONTAIN NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
("NORM"). SCALE FORMATION OR SLUDGE DEPOSITS CAN CONCENTRATE LOW LEVELS OF
NORM ON EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS. THE ASSETS SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
HAVE LEVELS OF NORM ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS, AND A HEALTH HAZARD MAY EXIST IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ASSETS BY REASON THEREOF. THEREFORE, PURCHASER MAY NEED TO
AND SHALL FOLLOW SAFETY PROCEDURES WHEN HANDLING THE ASSETS.

 

11.3 Casualty Loss; Condemnation.

 

(a) Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in
the condition of, the Assets from and after the Effective Time, including
with respect to the depletion of Hydrocarbons, the watering-out of any well,
the collapse of casing, sand infiltration of wells, and the depreciation of
personal property.

 

(b) If after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing any part of the
Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part
of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent
domain or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened (a
"Casualty Loss"), this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding any such damage, destruction, taking or proceeding, or the
threat thereof, and the Parties shall proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such damage, destruction,
taking or proceeding (without reduction of Purchase Price).

(c) Notwithstanding Section 11.3(a), in the event of any Casualty Loss, at
the Closing, Seller shall pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by third
parties by reason of the Casualty Loss and shall assign, transfer and set over
unto Purchaser all of the rights, title and interest of Seller in and to any
claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or other payments from third
parties arising out of such Casualty Loss. Seller shall carry and maintain
adequate insurance coverage with respect to the Assets, consistent with
prudent industry practices and applicable operating agreements affecting such
Assets.

12.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

12.4 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (together
with the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments
delivered by the Parties in connection with this Agreement): (a) constitutes
the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between or between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) except as provided in Article
X, is solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors,
legal representatives and assigns and does not confer on any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder. The Parties agree that no Party has made or
relied upon any express or implied agreements, representations or warranties
to the other Party, in all cases relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



52 12.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the
State of Texas, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Any disputes arising out
of or related to this Agreement (other than those expressly provided to be
resolved otherwise) will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
the state courts in Dallas County, Texas and in the United States District
Court located in such county, and each of the Parties hereby consents and
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such dispute and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such dispute in any such
court or that any such dispute has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

12.6 No Remedy in Certain Circumstances. Each Party agrees that, should any
court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless, during the period prior to
Closing only, the foregoing inconsistent action or the failure to take an
action constitutes a material breach of this Agreement or makes this
Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement shall terminate
pursuant to Article IX.

 

12.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

12.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party, except that a Party may assign, in its sole discretion, its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of such Party,
provided that such Party shall notify the other Party of any such assignment
and remain responsible for all of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a conversion of a Party to another
form of entity shall not be deemed to effect an assignment of any rights,
interest or obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

12.9 Waivers. At any time prior to the Closing, the Parties may, to the extent
legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive performance of any of the covenants
or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained herein. Any
agreement on the

 



53  part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. Except as
provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereof shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of
the same or any other provisions hereof.

 

12.10 Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall constitute a part of this
Agreement for all purposes and remain in full force and effect following the
execution of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, however,
that from and after the Closing, Confidential Information (as defined therein)
shall no longer include Confidential Information pertaining to the Assets.
Any and all information received by Purchaser pursuant to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to, and governed by the
applicable terms and provisions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

12.11 Waiver of Consumer Rights. AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE PARTIES
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF THE
TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, ARTICLE 17.41 ET
SEQ., TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL
RIGHTS AND PROTECTION, AND ALL OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS OF THE STATE OF
TEXAS, OR OF ANY OTHER STATE, THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THIS TRANSACTION, THAT
MAY BE WAIVED BY SUCH PARTY. IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF EITHER PARTY TO WAIVE,
AND NEITHER PARTY DOES HEREBY WAIVE, ANY LAW OR PROVISION THEREOF THAT IS
PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM BEING WAIVED. EACH PARTY REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS HAD AN
ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PRECEDING WAIVER PROVISION, INCLUDING THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT THE SAME TO LEGAL COUNSEL FOR REVIEW AND ADVICE
AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN ATTORNEY OF ITS OWN SELECTION VOLUNTARILY
CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER, AND UNDERSTANDS THE RIGHTS BEING WAIVED HEREIN.

 

12.12 Exclusive Remedy. THE PARTIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO DEFINE THEIR
RIGHTS, LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND PROVISIONS
OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE III AND
ARTICLE IV HEREIN, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT THEY ARE OWED ANY
DUTIES OR ARE ENTITLED TO ANY REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS
AGREEMENT EMBODIES THE JUSTIFIABLE EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES
DERIVED FROM ARMS LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS, AND ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
ANOTHER PARTY THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN ORDINARY
BUYER AND AN ORDINARY SELLER IN AN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION. THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS

 



54  AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN)
SHALL BE THOSE REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (AS SUCH REMEDIES MAY
BE FURTHER LIMITED OR EXCLUDED PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT), AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE
IV HEREIN, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE AND RELEASE ANY AND ALL TORT CLAIMS AND
CAUSES OF ACTION THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY TORT CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT). WITHOUT
LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT
TO WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF PURCHASER FOR ANY AND
ALL (A) CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, (B) OTHER CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND (C) OTHER CLAIMS RELATING TO THE ASSETS
AND THE PURCHASE AND SALE THEREOF SHALL BE ANY RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM
SUCH CLAIMS THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND, EXCEPT WITH
RESPECT TO WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, IF NO SUCH RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION IS
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THEN SUCH CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW.

12.13 Guaranty. Parent joins in the execution of this Agreement for the
limited purpose of providing an irrevocable guaranty to and in favor of Seller
of the due performance by Purchaser of all of Purchasers payment obligations
with respect to the Deferred Purchase Price and Purchasers indemnity
obligations hereunder (the "Guarantied Obligations"). Parent hereby
absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranties to Seller the payment,
when due, of the Guarantied Obligations, and if any Guarantied Obligation is
not paid in full by Purchaser when due, Parent will immediately pay such
Guarantied Obligation in full. Parents guaranty hereunder is a primary
obligation of Parent, is unconditional and absolute, and is a guaranty of
payment and not of collection. There are no conditions precedent to Parents
obligations to pay any Guarantied Obligation to Seller, other than the failure
of Purchaser to pay such Guarantied Obligation in full when due. Seller
may resort to Parent for payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations under
this Agreement whether or not Seller shall have attempted to institute suit,
collect or otherwise exercise or exhaust remedies against Purchaser or any
other Person prior to seeking payment hereunder, and Seller is not required
to join Purchaser or any other Person in any suit brought against Parent under
this Section 12.13. Parent hereby waives all defenses and claims relating to
(a) the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Purchaser, (b)
any change to the terms of the Guarantied Obligations that is binding on
Purchaser, whether such change increases, reduces, extends, accelerates or
otherwise modifies the terms of the Guarantied Obligations, (c) any delay or
any failure or refusal to act in the enforcement of the Guarantied Obligations
or of this guaranty, and (d) any invalidity of any Guarantied Obligations,
including without limitation any illegality or any failure or alleged failure
of Purchaser to have the power or authority to enter into the Guarantied
Obligations. Parent hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance,
presentment, demand for performance, notice of non-performance, 

 



55  default, acceleration, notice of acceleration, protest or dishonor and, to
the extent permitted by Law, any other notice with respect to any Guaranteed
Obligation and this guaranty, including notice of acceptance of this guaranty
and all rights of Guarantor under §43.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code, as amended. Parent hereby waives any and all rights of
subrogation to which Parent may otherwise be entitled against Purchaser as a
result of any payment made by Parent pursuant to this Section 12.13 or
otherwise under this Agreement unless and until all of the Guarantied
Obligations under this Agreement are fully and finally paid in full. This
guaranty pursuant to this Section 12.13 is a continuing guaranty and is
binding as a continuing obligation of Parent and cannot be assigned or
terminated without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent to be at
Sellers sole and absolute discretion Parent hereby represents and warrants
to Seller that (i) Parent is a limited partnership duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the state of Delaware, (ii) Parent possesses all
requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the
obligations contained herein and this Agreement has been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite limited partnership action on the part of Parent,
and (iii) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent. Sections 12.1 to 12.5, 12.7 and 12.8 of this Agreement are hereby
incorporated by reference into this Section 12.13, mutatis mutandis, as a part
hereof for all purposes.
