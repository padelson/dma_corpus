 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of May 28, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), KB Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and Kosan Biosciences Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

  

 WHEREAS Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), including the associated Company Rights, at a price per share of Company Common Stock (including the associated Company Rights) of $5.50 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS the Boards of Directors of each of the Company and Sub have approved the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement Parent, Sub and certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Specified Stockholders_ ") are entering into an agreement (the " _Stockholder Agreement_ " and, together with this Agreement, the " _Transaction Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the Specified Stockholders will agree to take specified actions in furtherance of the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

_The Offer_

  

 SECTION 1.01. _ The Offer._ (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) business days) after the date of this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, commence the Offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of the Company (unless the Company takes any action contemplated by Section 5.02(b)), Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner materially adverse to any holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.01(a), extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner materially adverse to any holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sub may, in its discretion, without consent      

of the Company, (A) without limiting Parent\'s or Sub\'s obligations under
the following sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for any
period ending no later than the Termination Date, if on any then-scheduled
expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not be
satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived and (B)
extend the Offer for any period ending no later than the Termination Date
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer. Parent and Sub agree that if not all of the Offer Conditions are
satisfied or, in Sub\'s sole discretion, waived on any then-
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, then, provided that all such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied by the Termination Date
and subject to the rights of Parent under Article VIII, Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) business days each, for an aggregate period of
time ending no later than the Termination Date that Parent reasonably
believes is necessary for such conditions to be satisfied, until such time as
such conditions are satisfied; provided, however, that Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. In any event, the
Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration
date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section
1.01(a)), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Article VIII. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, accept and pay for
(subject to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 1.01(d)) all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon
as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended
and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)). Acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date". Sub expressly reserves the
right to, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act following the
Offer Closing, and the Offer Documents may, in Sub\'s sole discretion,
provide for such a reservation of right.

  

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent and Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. 

   

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and 

        

pay for, pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Sub to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement.

  

 (d) Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Sub to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Sub. 

  

 SECTION 1.02. _ Company Actions._ (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. 

  

 (b) On or as promptly as practicable after the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") containing the recommendation described in Section 4.01(d) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company contained in the Schedule 14D-9. 

  

 (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the Company\'s possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 9, 2008 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the 

        

Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request,
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control.

  

 SECTION 1.03. _ Top-Up Option._ (a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis for all outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock outstanding on the date of determination); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares were outstanding) and (ii) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall not require approval of the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law (including the rules of NASDAQ). The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable at any one time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject only to the condition that no Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise shall be in effect. 

  

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. In the event Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give the Company at least three (3) business days prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashier\'s check or (ii) by issuance by Sub to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 

  

 (c) Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

  

    
ARTICLE II 

_The Merger_

   

 SECTION 2.01. _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the 

        

" _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective
Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall

ARTICLE III 

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations; 
Exchange of Certificates_

  

 SECTION 3.01. _ Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub: 

  

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock of Sub._ Each share of common stock of Sub, par value $0.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and (ii) except as provided in Section 3.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares held in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02(f) and any applicable tax Law. 

   

 (d) _ Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares held in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any 

  

      

  
  

other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

  

 (e) _ Adjustment Events_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. 

  

  

 SECTION 3.02. _ Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and turned over to Parent in accordance with Section 3.02(g). 

  

 (b)  _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

  

 (c)  _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

        

 (d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate that is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to one (1) year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e)  _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including any payments made in respect of the Appraisal Shares) to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (g)  _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the date six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 3.02(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (in jurisdictions
that recognize the concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such

good standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent, prior to the execution of this Agreement, complete

Except for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or equity interests in, any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

 (iv) There are no outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on transfer imposed by the Company. All outstanding Company Stock Options and Company RSUs have been granted under the Company Stock Plans. Other than the Company Stock Plans, there is no plan, contract, agreement or arrangement providing for the grant of options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 (v) With respect to the Company Stock Options, (A) each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (B) each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (C) each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws, including the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ "), (D) the per share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was equal to the fair market value (as defined in the Company Stock Plans) of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date and (E) each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Documents in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws.

The execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize the Transaction Agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Transaction Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company or the Specified Stockholders, as the case may be, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with their respective terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies). The execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement and compliance by 

  

      

  
  

Parent and Sub with the provisions of the Transaction Agreements will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or

Agreements or (z) subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in the following sentence, any Law or Judgment, in each case
applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective properties or other assets,
and in each case, in any way that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation by Parent of the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements. No material consent, approval, order or authorization of, action
by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub in

Parent and Sub or the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Offer, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, except

the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and (4) such other consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and
notices, the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect
the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Agreements or prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements.

  

 (c) _ Information Supplied._ None of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents (and none of the information supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement) will, (A) in the case of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Information Statement, at the respective times the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Information Statement are filed with the SEC or first published, sent or given to the Company\'s stockholders or (B) in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement that, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents based on information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (d) _ Interim Operations of Sub._ Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and has 

  

       

  
  

engaged in no business other than in connection with the Offer, the Merger

As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Sub owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record), and neither Parent nor Sub is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company (except as contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and except for any such shares that may be owned by any employee benefit or other plan administered by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent the determination to acquire such shares was not directed by Parent or Sub).

 SECTION 5.02. _ No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its and its Subsidiaries\' directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly (and it shall instruct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to instruct, each such Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to), (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action knowingly to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and (B) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to such person(s) within the last twelve (12) months for the purpose of evaluating a possible Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a material breach of this Section 5.02, may, and may permit and authorize its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which contains terms that are not materially less restrictive than those contained in each of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Standstill Agreement dated May 15, 2008 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Standstill Agreement_ ") and which need not restrict such person from making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal, _provided_ that all such information had been provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any material violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by any Subsidiary of the Company or any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' Representatives shall be deemed to be a material breach by the Company of this Section 5.02(a). 

       

           

    

  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ "
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent
or Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or
a series of transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar transaction, of (i)
assets or businesses that constitute or represent fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the total revenue or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company
which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, hold the assets or businesses
referred to in clause (i) above.

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer, which was not solicited after the date hereof and did not result from a material breach of Section 5.02(a), made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person (or in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, (i) provides a higher value to the stockholders of the Company than the consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer or this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise)), (ii) is not subject to any financing condition or financing contingency and (iii) is reasonably capable of being completed in a timely fashion, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, regarding the Offer or the Merger, or recommend, or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change"_ ), (ii) adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action, or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (y) in response to a Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and concurrently with such termination, cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement and _provided_ , _further_ , that (1) the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b) may be made, in each case unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (I) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (an " _Adverse_

        
  

 _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") or (II) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 5.02(b) in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action
by the Board of Directors of the Company is not related to a Superior
Proposal, contain a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving
rise to such proposed action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the
Board of Directors of the Company is a Superior Proposal, contain a
description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
and (B) Parent does not make, within five (5) business days after the
receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation), cause
such events, facts and circumstances to no longer require the Board of
Directors of the Company to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change to comply
with its fiduciary duties or cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case may
be. The Company agrees that, during the five (5) business day period prior to
its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 5.02(b), the Company and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent. Any material changes with respect to such events,
facts or circumstances mentioned above, or material changes to the financial
terms or any material change to other material terms of such Superior
Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company\'s effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.02(b) shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a five (5)
business day period and, in determining whether to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or whether to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.02(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account
any such changes.

information to the stockholders of the Company that is required to be made to
such stockholders under applicable Federal securities Laws or other Laws shall
not be considered an action prohibited by Section 5.02(b)).

 SECTION 6.01. _ Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting._ (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing, prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

  

 (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing (or, with respect to calling, giving notice of, convening and holding a meeting of its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable following the expiration of the time period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act or the resolution of any comments from the SEC), establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing) for, duly call, give notice of, 

        
  

convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders Meeting_
"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. The notice of
such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this
Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Sections
5.02(b) and 5.02(d), the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to
holders of the Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement, and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 6.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) any Adverse Recommendation Change
effected by the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Sub shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 SECTION 6.02. _ Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent\'s Representatives full access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and access to personnel records will be provided only if authorized by the specific employees), and during such period the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request (including the work papers of Ernst and Young LLP); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that doing so is restricted under applicable Law or otherwise would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records (if access to such personnel records is authorized by the specific employees) and such other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request ( _provided_ such review is permitted by applicable Law). No investigation by Parent or any of its Representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of its Representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation or warranty of the Company or any covenant or other provision in this Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Standstill Agreement and shall otherwise comply with the Confidentiality Agreement and Standstill Agreement with respect to such information. 

  

 SECTION 6.03. _ Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in _Exhibit A_ and Article VII, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other 

        
  

registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental
Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any
supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including
participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its
review of the Transaction Agreements, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (iv) coordinating
with the other party in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly
providing the other party with copies of all presentations, submissions or
other supplemental information drafted by a party in connection with a request
by a Governmental Entity, (v) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other person and (vi) to the extent commercially
reasonable in light of the circumstances, the defending of any suits, claims,
actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging the Transaction Agreements, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed. In connection with and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of
Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transaction Agreements or any of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby or thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Transaction Agreements, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree
or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or
any portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. The Company and Parent shall provide to each other such
assistance, information and cooperation as is reasonably required to obtain
any such actions, nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations and, in connection therewith, shall notify the other person
promptly following the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity
and of any request by any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or
additional information in respect of any registration, declaration or filing
with, or notice to, such Governmental Entity and shall supply the other
person with copies of all correspondence between such person or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand.

  

 (b) (i) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of: 

  

  

 (A) any breach, or the occurrence of any matter or event that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in any breach, of any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the failure, or the occurrence of any matter or event that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in the failure, of the Company to perform any obligation required to be performed by it under this Agreement, in each case to the extent that such breach or failure to perform would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (ii) of Exhibit A to be satisfied upon the expiration of the Offer; 

  

 (B) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and a copy of any such notice or communication shall be furnished to Parent together with the Company\'s written notice; 

  

      

  

 (C) any filing made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and a copy of any such filing shall be furnished to Parent together with the Company\'s written notice; and 

  

 (D) any actions, suits, claims, proceedings or litigations commenced or threatened that relate to the consummation of the Offer, the Merger, the Transaction Agreements or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (collectively, " _Transaction Claims_ ") of which the Company has knowledge; 

  

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement (including with respect to the
Offer). Neither the failure of the Company to deliver any notice required
pursuant to this Section 6.03(b)(i) nor any delay in the delivery of any such
notice shall be considered in determining whether the Offer Condition set
forth in paragraph (ii) of _Exhibit A_ has been satisfied or whether the
termination right set forth in Section 8.01(e) is available to Parent.

  

 (ii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Neither the failure of Parent to deliver any notice required pursuant to this Section 6.03(b)(ii) nor any delay in the delivery of any such notice shall be considered in determining whether the termination right set forth in Section 8.01(f) is available to the Company. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any Transaction Claims against the Company and/or its directors and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such Transaction Claim, it being understood and agreed that the Company shall control such defense and that this Section 6.03(c) shall in no event give Parent the right to direct such defense. 

  

 SECTION 6.04. _ Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans and the Purchase Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the following: 

  

  

 (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that the Company Stock Options will become fully vested and exercisable and may be exercised before the Effective Time at such applicable time or times as specified in the Company Stock Plans, and, at the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time; 

  

      

  

 (ii) at the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company RSU becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time; 

  

 (iii) with respect to the Purchase Plan, (A) participation shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement; (B) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the Purchase Plan as an "employee stock purchased plan" within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, such participants shall not be permitted to increase the rate of their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (C) no Offering Period (as defined in the Purchase Plan) shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement; (D) if the day immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Exercise Date_ ") occurs prior to the first Exercise Date (as defined in the Purchase Plan) following the date of this Agreement, each purchase right under the Purchase Plan outstanding on the New Exercise Date shall be automatically exercised by applying the payroll deductions of each then-current participant in the Purchase Plan for the then-current Offering Period in effect under the Purchase Plan to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the Purchase Plan regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per participant) at a purchase price per share equal to eighty five percent (85%) of the lower of (i) the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Purchase Plan) per share of Company Common Stock on the Enrollment Date (as defined in the Purchase Plan) and (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Company Common Stock on the New Exercise Date; and (E) the Purchase Plan shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the first exercise date following the date of this Agreement and the New Exercise Date, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights pursuant to clause (D) above. 

  

  

 (b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest.

 (d) The Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.04 and any other dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

  

 SECTION 6.05. _ Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company (in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement or as amended or entered into prior to the Effective Time with the consent of Parent) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of 

        
  

such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 6.06. _ Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 6.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement (as between the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand), the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreement, as the case may be, shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) and (B) prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any Takeover Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this Section 6.06(b)(i)(B), the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 5.02(a) except that all references to fifteen percent (15%) shall be deemed references to thirty five percent (35%)) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or 8.01(d) or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(g), then, in each such case, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $7,200,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (x) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section 6.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of such events, (y) in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or 8.01(d), within three (3) business days after such termination, and (z) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(g), the date of termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 6.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and that, without these 

        
  

agreements, Parent would not have entered into the Transaction Agreements.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to
Section 6.06(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in
Section 6.06(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in Section 6.06(b) at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in

 SECTION 6.08. _ Sub Compliance._ Parent shall cause Sub to comply with all of Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement and Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.

The Company shall take all action reasonably requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election or appointment, including (A) increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company and (B) obtaining the resignation of such number of its current directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Rules 4350(c) and 4350(d)(2)).

  (b) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s or Sub\'s
designees pursuant to Section 6.09(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Parent Independent Directors then in
office shall be required for (i) the Company to consent (a) to amend or
terminate this Agreement, (b) to waive any of the Company\'s rights or
remedies under this Agreement or (c) to extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Sub or (ii) any
withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification by the Company\'s Board
of Directors of the recommendation described in Section 4.01(d). For purposes
of this Agreement, a " _Parent Independent Director_ " shall mean a member of
the Company\'s Board of Directors that (i) would be an "independent director"
of Parent within the meaning of NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15) if such director were
then serving as a member of Parent\'s Board of Directors and (ii) does not
otherwise have a relationship which, in the opinion of the Company\'s Board
of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in
carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

  

 SECTION 6.10. _ Rule 14d-10 Matters._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Company Personnel unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which shall be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

terms speak as of a specified date will be determined as of such date, or (ii)
Parent or Sub shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior

incapable of being cured by Parent or Sub by the Termination Date or, if
capable of being cured by Parent by the Termination Date, Parent and Sub do
not commence to cure such breach or failure within ten (10) business days
after their receipt of written notice thereof from the Company use its
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such cure thereafter; or

  

 (g) by the Company in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 5.02(b). 

  

 SECTION 8.02. _ Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, except that (a) the provisions of Section 4.01(s), the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.06, this Section 8.02 and Article IX shall survive such termination and (b) the termination of this Agreement and/or any other agreement between the parties or any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.06(b) shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for any material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 8.03. _ Amendment._ Subject to Section 6.09(b), this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder Approval, if required by applicable Law, has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after the Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration and (b) after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders.

 SECTION 8.04. _ Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, subject to Section 6.09(b), (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by Law requires further approval by stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets forth the terms of such extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

 SECTION 9.10. _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with the Transaction Agreements.

approval must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other parties
by a person duly authorized by such party to do so.

  

 SECTION 9.13. _ Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. 

       

              SECTION 9.14. _ Obligation of Parent._
Parent shall ensure that each of Sub and the Surviving Corporation duly
performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis each of the covenants,

 Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Sub to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if, upon the expiration of the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to Section 1.01(a) of this Agreement) and before acceptance of such shares of Company Common Stock for payment, any of the following conditions exists and is continuing and has not resulted directly or indirectly from any breach by Parent or Sub of the Agreement:

 (iv) there shall be in effect any Legal Restraint that would reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the effects referred to in clauses (A) or (B) of paragraph (iii) above; 

  

 (v) since the date of this Agreement, a Material Adverse Effect on or with respect to the Company shall have occurred; or 

  

 (vi) this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

  

 The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and may be asserted by Parent or Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived by Sub and Parent in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion. The failure by Parent, Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
