(B)&nbsp;extend the Offer for any period ending no later than the Termination Date required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")

to, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act following the Offer Closing, and the Offer

share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Top-Up Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>")
equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares
(determined on a fully diluted basis for all outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock outstanding on the date of determination); </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that (i)&nbsp;the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number
of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (giving effect to the shares of
Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares were
outstanding) and (ii)&nbsp;the issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall not require approval of the Company's stockholders under applicable Law (including the rules of NASDAQ). The
Top-Up Option shall be exercisable at any one time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (a)&nbsp;the Effective Time and (b)&nbsp;the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject only to the
condition that no Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such
exercise shall be in effect. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable
exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. In the event Sub wishes to
exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give the Company at least three (3)&nbsp;business days prior written notice, specifying (i)&nbsp;the number of shares of the Company Common Stock
directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such notice and (ii)&nbsp;a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of
Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i)&nbsp;in cash, by wire transfer or cashier's check or (ii)&nbsp;by issuance by Sub
to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and
will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Sub is, and will be, upon
the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule&nbsp;501 of Regulation&nbsp;D under the Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option
and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). </FONT></P>

Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including by way of
any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
license agreement or similar transaction, of (i)&nbsp;assets or businesses that constitute or represent fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total revenue or assets of the Company and its

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Superior Proposal</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" means any bona fide written offer, which was not solicited after the date
hereof and did not result from a material breach of Section&nbsp;5.02(a), made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person
(or in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the
Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, (i)&nbsp;provides a higher value to the stockholders of the Company than the
