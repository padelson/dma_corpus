 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of June 26, 2008, among ORBOTECH LTD., a company organized under the laws of Israel (" _Parent_ "), PDI ACQUISITION, INC., a California corporation (" _Sub_ ") and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and PHOTON DYNAMICS, INC., a California corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned by Parent, Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive $15.60 in cash; and 

   

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Merger_   

  

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the California General Corporation Law (the " _CGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03). Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). At the election of Parent, any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger. In such event, the parties shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing. The Merger, the payment of cash in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Transactions_ ". 

   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day following the 

    #####

satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law (as defined in Section
3.05(a)), waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of
the conditions set forth in Article VII, or at such other place, time and
date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ". 

   

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ The parties shall jointly prepare and execute, and the Surviving Corporation shall file as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, with the Secretary of State of the State of California, an agreement of merger with an officers certificate of each of the constituent corporations (together, the " _Merger Filing_ ") executed in accordance with Section 1103 of the CGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the CGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Merger Filing is accepted for filing with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Merger Filing (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the CGCL, including in Sections 1107 and 1107.5 of the CGCL. 

   

 SECTION 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended as of the Effective Time so that Article III of such Articles of Incorporation reads in its entirety as follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, no par value per share.", and, as so amended, such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The By-laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case 
 may be. 

   

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.  #####

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of and simultaneously with the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(a) and 2.01(b), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive $15.60 in cash (the " _Company Common Stock Price_ "). 

   

 (2) The aggregate cash payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. 

   

 (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (A) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock combination, reverse stock split or similar transaction, (B) the Company declares or makes any dividend or distribution on its shares or (C) the Company engages in any spin-off or split-off to its shareholders, then in any such case the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect such action (it being understood that pursuant to Article V none of the foregoing actions are permitted between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time).  ##### 

  

  

4   

 (d) _Dissent Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are (i) determined to be "dissenting shares" under Section 1300(b) of the CGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), (ii) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Chapter 13 of the CGCL, shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 1301 of the CGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair market value under Section 1301, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair market value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or any other Parent Subsidiary (as defined in Section 6.06(b))) to, deposit with Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or such other bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Paying Agent, the cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash out of the Exchange Fund to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have surrendered their certificates representing such stock as set forth in Section 2.02(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 (the " _Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying 

    ##### 

  

 

5 

Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of
Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereunder. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. After the close of business on the day in which the Effective Time occurs there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged against the delivery of Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent, and Parent shall remain liable, for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned 

    ##### 

  

 

6 

property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered
prior to the date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.05(b)), then, immediately prior
to such date, any cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. If, subject to the first sentence of Section 2.02(a), for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the amount of such insufficiency. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance (New Version) 1961, as amended, or under any other provision of U.S. state, local, Israeli or other foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (which affidavit shall include an undertaking (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) to indemnify Parent for any losses incurred by Parent in connection with any action taken pursuant to this clause (h)) and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_   

  

 The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that, except as set forth in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent and Sub (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such letter relates) (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "): 

   

 SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of the Company and each of its subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized, validly existing and, where relevant, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03(a)). The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary other than in any such jurisdiction where the failure to so qualify, individually or in the aggregate, has not had or is not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Charter_ "), and the By-laws of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company By-laws_ "), and the comparable charter and organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, in each case as amended through the date of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 3.02. _Company Subsidiaries; Equity Interests._ (a) Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists as of the date of this Agreement each Company Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by another Company Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (each a " _Lien_ " and, collectively, " _Liens_ ") (other than transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws). 

   

 (b) Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any person. 

   

 (c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) carries on business in Israel in such a manner so as to require it to register as a foreign corporation 

     ##### 

  

  

8  

or owns, directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any person that is
organized in Israel or that conducts business in Israel; or (ii) has made any

The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any material unwritten Company Benefit Plans or material unwritten Company Benefit Agreements, written descriptions thereof), (ii) the two most recent annual reports required to be filed, or such similar reports, statements, information returns or material  ##### 

 

 

19 

correspondence filed with or delivered to any Governmental Entity, with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan (including reports filed on Form 5500
with accompanying schedules and attachments), (iii) the most recent summary
plan description prepared for each Company Benefit Plan, (iv) each trust
agreement and group annuity contract and other documents relating to
the funding or payment of benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, (v) the
most recent determination or qualification letter issued by any Governmental
Entity for each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify for favorable tax
treatment and (vi) if applicable, the two most recent actuarial valuations
for each Company Benefit Plan. All Company Participant data necessary to
administer each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement is in the
possession of the Company and is sufficient for the proper administration of
the Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements in accordance, in
all material respects, with their terms and all applicable Laws and such data
is complete and correct in all material respects. Each Company Benefit Plan
has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries and all the Company Benefit Plans
are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code, and all other applicable Laws (in the case of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as such Laws relate to the Company
Benefit Plans), and the terms of all collective bargaining agreements, if
any. All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified under U.S. Laws
have been the subject of determination or opinion letters from the IRS with
respect to "TRA" (as defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39) and have timely
filed with the IRS determination letter applications (or have received such a
determination letter) with respect to "GUST" (as defined in Section 1 of
Notice 2001-42) and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001, to the effect that such Company Pension Plans are qualified and exempt
from United States Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code; no such letter has been revoked (nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened) nor has any event
occurred since the date of the most recent determination letter or
application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that is
reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualification of such Company
Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or require
security under Section 307 of ERISA. All Company Pension Plans required to
have been approved by any non-U.S. Governmental Entity have been so approved
or timely submitted for approval; no such approval has been revoked (nor, to
the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened) and no event
has occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application
therefor that is reasonably expected to affect any such approval
or materially increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of each pending
application for a determination or approval letter, if any, with respect to
each Company Pension Plan. 

   

 (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Commonly Controlled Entity has in the last six years maintained, contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has any actual or contingent liability under, any Company Benefit Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), a "multiemployer  ##### 

 

 

20 

plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), or is subject to
Title IV of ERISA and neither the Company nor any Company Commonly Controlled
Entity could incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA. 

   

 (c) With respect to each Company Welfare Plan, there are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that would prevent any such plan (including any such plan covering retirees or other former Company Participants) from being amended or terminated without material liability to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries at or at any time after the Closing. No Company Welfare Plan is unfunded or, if subject to the Code, funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code). No Company Welfare Plan provides benefits after termination of employment except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar U.S. state statute with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or any similar U.S. state statute. 

   

 (d) All material reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all Company Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any Company Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received notice of and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect to, or pending termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements), suits, actions or proceedings against, or involving or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. 

   

 (e) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans and applicable Laws have been timely made. No Company Benefit Plan, or any insurance Contract related thereto, requires or permits a retroactive increase in premiums or payments on termination of such Company Benefit Plan or such insurance Contract. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any unfunded liabilities in relation to any Company Benefit Plan, and for any Company Benefit Plan for which funding is not required, all unfunded liabilities have been properly accrued on the Companys most recent financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 

   

 (f) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (i) there has not occurred any prohibited transaction in which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their employees, or to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created under any Company Benefit Plan, has engaged that  ##### 

 

 

21 

could subject the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
employees, or, to the knowledge of the Company, a trustee, administrator or
other fiduciary of any trust created under any Company Benefit Plan, to a
material tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of
the Code or a material sanction imposed under Title I of ERISA and (ii) none
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan nor
any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in any transaction or acted in
a manner that could, or failed to act so as to, subject the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary to any material liability for breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law. No Company Benefit
Plan or related trust has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable
event" (as such term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable event
will be required to be filed in connection with the Transactions. 

   

 (g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or obligations that are material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company and treating such persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of the Company. 

   

 (h) No deduction by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in respect of "any applicable remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

 (j) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Company Shareholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other  ##### 

 

 

22 

transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of any
termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (i)
entitle any Company Participant to severance or termination pay, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or accelerate exercisability of, or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise)
of, compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger
any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. 

   

 (k) Each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Company Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of (i) Section 409A of the Code and (ii)(A) the Final Regulations issued thereunder, (B) the Proposed Regulations issued thereunder or (C) IRS Notice 2005-1, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), as modified by IRS Notice 2006-79 and Notice 2007-86 (clauses (i) and (ii), together, the " _409A Authorities_ "). No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that would be a Company Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code but for the effective date provisions that are applicable to Section 409A of the Code, as set forth in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as amended (the " _AJCA_ "), has been "materially modified" within the meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3, 2004, based upon a good faith reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the 409A Authorities, or has been operated in violation of the 409A Authorities.

to make a Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Company Proposal and (3) the waiver
is limited to making a Company Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval by the Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger or the Company Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.01(c)), (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal.

Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation
and By-laws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Persons as the indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of
incorporation and By-laws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, and such provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were covered
by such provisions, except as required by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase "tail" officers and directors liability insurance policies, which by their terms shall survive the Merger and shall provide each Indemnified Person with coverage for six years following the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable than the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance (" _Tail Policies_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate premium for such Tail Policies shall not be greater than 150% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such existing insurance (such 150% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the Maximum Premium is not sufficient for such coverage, the Company shall spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall comply with their respective obligations under the Tail Policies. The Company represents and warrants to Parent that the Maximum Premium is $615,600. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this Section 6.07 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the Indemnified Persons by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Persons, their heirs and their representatives as third-party beneficiaries.

and (iv) above such payment shall be made on the date of execution of such
definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions).

 (d) The Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, up to a maximum reimbursement of $2,000,000, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(c) unless the Company is required to pay and actually pays to Parent a fee pursuant to Section 6.08(b) in connection with such termination. Any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 6.08(d) shall be credited against any fee subsequently payable under Section 6.08(b). 

  

 SECTION 6.09. _Public Announcements._ Parent, Sub and the Company have agreed on the form of press release attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement which is to be issued upon signing of this Agreement. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall otherwise consult with each other before issuing or permitting their respective affiliates to issue, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue or permit their respective affiliates to issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. 

  

 SECTION 6.10. _Certain Tax Matters._ (a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, (i) the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall timely file all Tax Returns (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") required to be filed by each such entity (after taking into account any extensions), and all Post-Signing Returns shall be complete and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company and (ii) the Company and each  ##### 

 

 

51   

Company Subsidiary shall promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action,
investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in respect of any material Tax and will not
settle or compromise any such suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding
or audit without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (b) The Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to Closing a certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying that the Company has not been a U.S. real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code at any time during the five year period ending on the date of the Closing. 

  

 SECTION 6.11. _Financing._ (a) Parent and Sub shall use their best efforts to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub in the Financing Commitment and to consummate the Financing no later than the Outside Date. Solely in the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain any such unavailable portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable good-faith judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than the Outside Date. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with the documentation evidencing any replacement or alternative sources of financing and shall give the Company prompt notice (but in any event within two Business Days) of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitment or any termination of the Financing Commitment. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange for the Financing (or replacements thereof) and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitment (or replacements thereof) without first consulting with the Company or, if such amendment would or would be reasonably expected to prevent, delay or hinder Parents and/or Subs ability to consummate the Transactions, without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any replacement or alternative financing) has not been obtained, Parent and Sub shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII and to Parents rights and obligations under Article VIII. 

  

 (b) The Company shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to provide all reasonable cooperation in connection with the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, which cooperation shall include provision of such information regarding the Company as is reasonably requested by the Lender or other financial institution providing the Financing, review and consultation with respect to the preparation of all agreements, offering memoranda and other documentation (including review of schedules for completeness) required in connection with the Financing and attendance and participation at meetings by telephone and in  ##### 

 

 

52   

person with respect to syndication and marketing as is reasonably requested by
Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation in
response to any request that is not a customary request of a target company
in a leveraged acquisition transaction.

54   

that no action by the President is warranted; or the President shall have made
a determination not to take any action with respect to the Transactions.

 (b) by either Parent or the Company: 

   

 (i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before December 26, 2008 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that either Parent or the Company may elect to extend the term of this Agreement until not later than March 26, 2009, if the expiration of any waiting period or any consents, approvals or filings needed to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(b) and 7.02(d) shall not have occurred or been made or obtained, as the case may be, by the Outside Date;  ##### 

 

 

55   

 (ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or 

   

 (iii) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting, or postponement or adjournment thereof, to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Shareholder Approval is not obtained; 

  

 (c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement or any of the Companys representations and warranties contained in this Agreement is or becomes untrue, which breach or failure to perform or untruth (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b), and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the Company of such breach (provided that Parent is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); 

  

 (d) by Parent: 

   

 (i) if the Company Board or any committee thereof withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or proposes to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or its approval of this Agreement or the Merger, fails to recommend to the Companys shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval or approves or recommends, or publicly proposes to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal; or 

   

 (ii) if following the public announcement of any Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board fails to reaffirm publicly and unconditionally the Company Board Recommendation to the Companys shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval within 20 days of Parents written request for such public reaffirmation, which public reaffirmation must also include the unconditional rejection of such Company Takeover Proposal; 

  

 (e) by the Company, if Parent breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement which breach or failure to perform cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach ( _provided_  that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); 

  

 (f) by the Company prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval in accordance with Section 8.05(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall have complied with all provisions thereof, including the notice provisions therein; and  #####

In the event that the fee provided for in Section 6.08(b) is payable and is actually paid by the Company to Parent, such payment shall constitute the exclusive remedy of Parent and Sub for breaches of this Agreement or other claims that relate to the Transactions. In the event that the fee provided for in Section 6.08(c) is payable and is actually paid by Parent to the Company, such payment shall constitute the exclusive remedy of the Company for breaches of this Agreement or other claims that relate to the Transactions. 

  

 SECTION 8.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company or Parent without the further approval of such shareholders and (ii) except as provided above no amendment of this Agreement by the Company shall require the approval of the shareholders of the Company.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. Nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

 SECTION 9.04. _Interpretation; Company Disclosure Letter._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Any matter disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed only for the purposes of the specific Sections of this Agreement to which such section relates. 

  

 SECTION 9.05. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 9.06. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall  ##### 

 

 

64   

become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. 

  

 SECTION 9.07. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the Transactions and (b) except for Section 6.07, are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies. 

  

 SECTION 9.08. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof, except to the extent the laws of California are mandatorily applicable to the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 SECTION 9.10. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall in such event be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Any and all suits, legal actions or proceedings arising out of this Agreement shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (and only after) such Court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such suit, legal action or proceeding, such suit, legal action or proceeding shall be brought in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. Each party hereto hereby submits to and accepts the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of such suits, legal actions or proceedings. In any such suit, legal action or proceeding, each party hereto waives personal service of any summons, complaint or other process and agrees that service thereof may be made by certified or registered mail directed to it at its address for notices pursuant to this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, legal action or proceeding in any such court and hereby further waives any claim that any suit, legal action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought  ##### 

 

 

65   

in an inconvenient forum. Each party expressly waives any right to trial by
jury with respect to any suit, legal action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.  ##### 

 

 

66  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have duly executed this Agreement, all as of the date first written above.
