under any other provision of U.S. state, local, Israeli or other foreign tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or

consists of 30,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with
no par value (the &#147;<U>Company Preferred Stock</U>&#148;). At the close of business on June&nbsp;24, 2008,
(i)&nbsp;17,813,875 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, of which none were
subject to vesting or restrictions on transfer, (ii)&nbsp;1,119,690 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to Company Stock Plans (as defined in Section&nbsp;6.05(d))
and (iii)&nbsp;no shares of Company Preferred Stock were outstanding. Except as set forth above, as of
the date of this Agreement, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company
were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding Company SARs (as
defined in Section&nbsp;6.05(d)). Section&nbsp;3.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
and accurate list, as of June&nbsp;24, 2008, of all outstanding Company Stock Options (as defined in
Section&nbsp;6.05(d)) and Company RSUs (as defined in Section&nbsp;6.05(d)), the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject thereto, the exercise prices (if applicable) and vesting schedules thereof and
whether any of the foregoing are subject to terms that provide for acceleration of vesting upon the
consummation of the Merger. All Company Stock Options and Company RSUs are evidenced by stock
option agreements or restricted stock unit agreements, in each case substantially identical to the
forms set forth in Section&nbsp;3.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and no stock option agreement or
restricted stock unit agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with, or in addition to, the
terms contained in such forms. With respect to the Company Stock Options, (i)&nbsp;each Company Stock
Option that was intended to qualify as an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code so
qualifies, (ii)&nbsp;each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the date on
which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the &#147;<U>Grant
Date</U>&#148;) by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Company
Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required shareholder
approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing
such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party whose signature was necessary to
make such agreement legally binding, (iii)&nbsp;each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Plans and all other applicable Laws and regulatory rules or requirements and (iv)
the per share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was equal to the fair market value of a
share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date. The maximum number of shares of
Company Common Stock that could be purchased with accumulated payroll deductions under the ESPP (as

value of a share of Company Common Stock on such date is equal to $15.60 and payroll deductions
continue at the current rate) is 70,000. Each Company Stock Option and Company RSU may be treated

material conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment and that the
Financing will be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Except for the payment of

the full amount of the Financing (including in any side letter or similar arrangement), other than
as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitment.
