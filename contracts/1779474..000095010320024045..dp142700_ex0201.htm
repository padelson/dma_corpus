Section 4.08   _Exchange Agent_. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Funding Amount as directed by, prior to the
Closing, Silver Spike and, after, the Closing, the Surviving Pubco; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the Holders pursuant to this _Article 4_. Any interest or
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Pubco, upon demand. Promptly following the earlier of (i) the date on which
the entire Funding Amount has been disbursed and (ii) the date which is twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Pubco shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to deliver to the Surviving Pubco any remaining portion of the
Funding Amount, Letters of Transmittal, and other documents in its possession
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agent's
duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each Holder may look only to the Surviving
Pubco (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger
Consideration that such Holder may have the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article 4_ without any interest thereon.

  



  

Section 4.09   _No Liability; Withholding_.

  



  

(a)  None of Silver Spike, the Surviving Pubco, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any portion
of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration
that remains undistributed to the Holders as of immediately prior to the date
on which the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(b)  Each of Silver Spike, the Surviving Pubco, the Surviving
Company and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Law;
provided, however, that the relevant payor will reasonably cooperate with the
relevant payee prior to the making of such deductions and withholding payments
to determine whether any such deductions or withholding payments (other than
with respect to compensatory payments) are required under applicable Law and
in obtaining any available exemption or reduction of, or otherwise minimizing
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such deduction and withholding.
Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. The parties to
this Agreement acknowledge that no withholding is required under applicable
U.S. federal income Tax Law as in effect as of the Effective Time (other than
with respect to compensatory payments or any deduction or withholding
required by reason of the failure by any Holder to timely provide a duly
executed and properly completed IRS Form W-9) with respect to any amounts
payable pursuant to this this Agreement.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(c)  If a Holder is unable to provide a duly executed and
properly completed IRS Form W-9, then (i) such Holder shall provide a
certificate substantially in the form described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1446(f)-2(c)(2)(ii)(B) or (ii) the Company shall deliver a
certificate substantially in in the form described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1446(f)-2(c)(2)(ii)(C), in each case that is reasonably acceptable
to Silver Spike, setting forth the liabilities of the Company allocated to the
Common Units or Incentive Units sold or deemed to be sold pursuant to this
Agreement under Section 752 of the Code.

(other than (x) holders of Silver Spike Ordinary Shares who shall have
exercised their Silver Spike Shareholder Redemption Right, (y) the Deferred
Underwriting Amount and (z) any other amounts set forth on _Section_ 6.11 of
the Silver Spike Disclosure Schedule) to any portion of the proceeds in the

becoming due to any director, officer or employee of Silver Spike; or (b)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits. Other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by

Contract"). All Silver Spike Material Contracts have been made available to
the Company.

Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the
terms of the Trust Agreement and the Silver Spike Governing Document, to

soliciting proxies from Silver Spike Shareholders to obtain the requisite
approval for the amendment of the Silver Spike Governing Document to extend

Section 9.02   _Efforts to Consummate_. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided, each Party shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated hereby (including (x) the

transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i) promptly notify the other Parties of, and if in writing, furnish the other
Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
other parties hereto of) any material substantive communications from or with
any Governmental Authority or NASDAQ, (ii) cooperate in connection with any
proposed substantive written or oral communication with any
Governmental Authority and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the view of the other Parties in
connection with, any proposed substantive written or oral communication with
any Governmental Authority or NASDAQ, (iii) not participate in any
substantive meeting or have any substantive communication with any
Governmental Authority or NASDAQ unless it has given the other Parties a
reasonable opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the extent

or their outside counsel the opportunity to attend and participate therein,
(iv) furnish such other Parties' outside legal counsel with copies of all

Authority or NASDAQ; provided, that materials required to be provided
pursuant to this Section may be restricted to outside legal counsel and may
be redacted (A) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (B)
to remove references to privileged information.

  



  

Section 9.03   _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Silver Spike Parties agree that all rights
held by each present and former director and officer of the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time, provided in the
respective certificate of formation, operating agreement or other
organizational documents of the Company or such Subsidiary in effect on the
date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the Surviving Pubco shall
cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a period of
not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in its
certificate of formation, operating agreement and other organizational
documents concerning the indemnification and exculpation (including
provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' former and current officers, directors, employees, and agents
that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the
certificate of formation, operating agreement and other organizational
documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as
of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise
modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights
of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

  



  

(b)  The Company shall cause coverage to be extended under the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six (6)
year "tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. If any claim is asserted or made
within such six (6) year period, the provisions of this _Section 9.03_ shall
be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Section 9.03 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of the Surviving Pubco and the Surviving Company. In the event
that the Surviving Pubco or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Pubco or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 9.03_.

  



  

(d)  The Surviving Pubco shall maintain customary DandO insurance
on behalf of any Person who is or was a director or officer of the Surviving
Pubco (at any time, including prior to the date hereof) against any liability
asserted against such Person and incurred by such Person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such Person's status as such, whether or not the
Surviving Pubco would have the power to indemnify such Person against such
liability under the provisions of the Surviving Pubco Certificate of
Incorporation, the Surviving Pubco Bylaws or Section 145 of the DGCL or any
other provision of Law.

  



  

Section 9.04   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  The Parties intend that for U.S. federal (and, as
applicable, state and local) income Tax purposes: (i) the Domestication be
treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the
Code and that this Agreement be adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, (ii) the Surviving Company is a continuation of the Company and
(iii) the receipt by the Surviving Pubco of the Acquired Surviving
Company Units in the Merger be treated as (A) the receipt of the Issued
Surviving Company Units in exchange for the Surviving Pubco's contribution of
the Primary Capital to the Surviving Company in a contribution governed by
Section 721 of the Code, and (B) the purchase of the Purchased Surviving
Company Units in exchange for the Surviving Pubco's payment to the applicable
Holders of the Aggregate Cash Consideration, certain rights under the Tax
Receivable Agreement, and the Surviving Pubco Class V Common Stock, which
purchase is a taxable transaction under Section 741 of the Code and gives rise
to an adjustment to the Surviving Pubco's tax basis in the direct and
indirect assets of the Surviving Company pursuant to Section 743(b) of the
Code (clauses (i) through (iii), the " Intended Tax Treatment"). The Parties
hereto agree to use the interim closing method under Section 706 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder to allocate income, gain,
loss, deduction or any other items of the Company between the Surviving Pubco
and the Holders for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date. Each of
the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to take an action
that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify for
the Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

(b)  The Parties agree and shall cause the Company, the
Surviving Company and each Subsidiary of the Company that is classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes to have in effect for the tax
period that includes the Closing Date a valid election pursuant to Section
754 of the Code.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(c)  Within 60 days after the Closing, the Surviving Pubco
shall deliver to the Holder Representative a written allocation
statement allocating the Aggregate Cash Consideration and any other amounts
treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes with respect to
the taxable sale of the Purchased Surviving Company Units among the assets of
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries that are classified as entities
that are disregarded as separate from the Surviving Company for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes (the "Proposed Allocation Schedule"). The Proposed
Allocation Schedule shall contain sufficient detail to permit the Parties to
make the computations and adjustments required under Sections 743, 751(a) and
755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Such Proposed
Allocation Schedule shall become final and binding (the "Final Allocation
Schedule") 60 days after receipt by the Holder Representative, unless the
Holder Representative provides written notice of its objection to the
Proposed Allocation Schedule, specifying those items as to which the Holder
Representative disagrees with the calculation. The Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts for a period of 30 days to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the Proposed Allocation Schedule. If the Parties are unable
to resolve such disagreements, determination of the Final Allocation Schedule
shall be made by an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing reasonably satisfactory to Surviving Pubco and the Holder
Representative (which shall not have any material relationship with Surviving
Pubco, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates) (the "Accounting
Referee") within 45 days of receipt of written submissions from each of the
Surviving Pubco and Holder Representative regarding its position with respect
to the disputed items. The Accounting Referee will make a final, conclusive
and binding determination based on the written submissions supplied by the
parties and pursuant to applicable Law. Each of the Surviving Pubco and the
Holder Representative shall be responsible for and pay one-half of any and all
fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee incurred pursuant to this
paragraph. Within 30 days following the Closing, the Surviving Pubco
shall deliver Section 743 notification to the Company in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.743-1(k)(2). The Parties (i) agree that the
value allocated to the Surviving Pubco Class V Common Stock shall be the par
value of such Surviving Pubco Class V Common Stock and (ii) shall report
consistently with such determination for U.S. federal (and applicable state
and local) income Tax purposes.

  



  

(d)  Except as required by a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code, the Parties shall, and shall cause each of their
respective applicable Affiliates to: (1) prepare and file all Tax Returns
consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule and Intended Tax Treatment
(collectively, the "Tax Positions"); (2) take no position in any
communication with any Governmental Authority or any other action
inconsistent with the Tax Positions; (3) promptly inform each other of
any challenge by any Governmental Authority to any portion of the Tax
Positions; (4) consult with and keep one another informed with respect to the
status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, any
such challenge to any portion of the Tax Positions; and (5) use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to defend the Tax Positions in
any Tax Proceeding.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(e)  The Surviving Pubco shall prepare and timely file, or
shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for
the Surviving Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed
after the Closing. With respect to any Tax Returns of the Surviving Company,
the Company or their Subsidiaries that are of the type used to report the
income, loss, gain, deduction and other Tax attributes from the operation of
a partnership or other pass-through entity and that are of the type that could
reflect items of income, loss, gain, deduction or other Tax attributes
required to be included on a Tax Return of a Holder, and which Tax Return of
the Surviving Company, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relates to a
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date
(whether or not such items are actually reflected thereon) (each such Tax
Return, a "Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return" and each such item a "Pre-
Closing Flow-Through Tax Item"), (i) such Tax Returns shall be prepared
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
(ii) the Surviving Pubco shall submit such Tax Return to the Holder
Representative no later than thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax
Return for its review, (iii) the Surviving Pubco shall make any changes to
such Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Holder Representative to the
extent such comments relate to Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Items and (iv) no
such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return shall be filed without the prior
written consent of the Holder Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent shall be
deemed to be granted twenty (20) days after a Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax
Return is provided to the Holder Representative if the Holder Representative
does not provide comments by such time). All other Tax Returns shall be
prepared consistent with the provisions of the Surviving Company AandR LLCA.

  



  

(f)  After the Closing, without the prior written consent of
the Holder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Surviving Pubco shall not (and shall neither
cause nor permit the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) take any of
the following actions: (w) file (except in accordance with Section 9.04(d)),
amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return,
(x) enter into an agreement to extend the statute of limitations with respect
to any Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return, (y) except for making the
elections contemplated in _Section 9.04(b)_  and _Section 9.04(h)_ , make,
change, or revoke any Tax election affecting a Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax
Return or Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Item, or (z) initiate any discussion,
voluntary disclosure or examination with any Governmental Authority
regarding Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Returns or Pre-Closing Flow-Through
Items.

  



  

(g)  All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be borne by the Surviving Pubco and paid when due.
The Surviving Pubco shall timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Tax Returns and, if required by
applicable Law, the Holders will join in the execution of any such Tax Return
or documentation.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(h)  After the Closing, each Party shall promptly notify the
other Parties in writing upon receipt by the applicable Party or its
Affiliates of notice of any audit, examination, claim or other similar
proceeding (a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax
Returns or Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Items. Such notification shall specify
in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Proceeding and shall include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority. The Holder Representative shall have exclusive authority to control
any Tax Proceeding pertaining to any Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return for
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, _provided_ that (i)
the Surviving Pubco shall have the right to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding, and (ii) the Holder Representative shall not settle any such
Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Surviving Pubco,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Surviving Pubco shall have the exclusive authority to control any other Tax
Proceeding relating to the Surviving Company, the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that (i) Holder Representative shall have the right
to participate, at its own cost, in any audits or examinations related to
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Returns or Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Items,
and (ii) the Surviving Pubco shall not settle any such Tax Proceeding that
could reasonably be expected to affect a Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Return
or Pre-Closing Flow-Through Tax Item without the prior written consent of
Holder Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent that Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code, as
amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, apply to the Surviving Company,
the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Silver
Spike, the Surviving Company or the Company shall make the election under
Section 6226(a) of the Code with respect to the alternative to payment of
imputed underpayment by the Company for any taxable year that begins on or
before the Closing Date, and the parties hereto shall take any other
action such as filings, disclosures and notifications necessary to effectuate
such election.

  



  

(i)  The Surviving Pubco and the Holders shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing or amendment of Tax Returns, the preparation of
schedules described in Section 9.04(c) and any audit or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Surviving Pubco, the Surviving Company,
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

  



  

(j)  Prior to the Closing, each Holder shall have delivered
to Silver Spike a properly signed IRS Form W-9.

  



  

Section 9.05   _Proxy Statement; Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, Silver Spike and the Company shall prepare, and Silver Spike
shall file with the SEC, (i) a preliminary proxy statement in connection with
the Merger to be filed as part of the Registration Statement and sent to the
Pre-Closing Silver Spike Holders relating to the Silver Spike Extraordinary
General Meeting (such proxy statement, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") for the purposes of the approval
of the Transaction Proposals and (ii) the Registration Statement, in which the
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Silver Spike and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and cause
their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to reasonably cooperate, with
each other and their respective representatives in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement. Silver Spike shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof and to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the Merger.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(b)  Silver Spike shall as promptly as practicable notify the
Company of any correspondence with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement,
the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy
Statement, and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information. Silver Spike shall cooperate and
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and
all responses to requests for additional information by and replies to
comments of the SEC and give due consideration to all comments reasonably
proposed by the Company in respect of such documents and responses prior to
filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and, to the extent practicable,
the Parties will provide each other with copies of all such filings made and
correspondence with the SEC. Silver Spike shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "blue sky" permits
and approvals required to carry out the Merger, and each of the Company and
the Holder Representative shall promptly furnish all information concerning
the Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.
Each of Silver Spike, the Company and the Holder Representative shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish to each other party all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, officers, directors,
managers, members and stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters, in
each case, as may be reasonably necessary in connection with and for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Silver Spike, the
Company and the Holder Representative or their respective Subsidiaries, as

(d)  Each of Silver Spike, the Company and the Holder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that none
of the information related to it or any of its Affiliates, supplied by or on
its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) either Proxy
Statement will, as of the date it is first mailed to the Pre-Closing Silver
Spike Holders, or at the time of the Silver Spike Extraordinary General

respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors or officers, as applicable, or
the Holders is discovered by any of Silver Spike or the Company and is

in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties

to consider and vote upon the Transaction Proposals and to provide the Silver
Spike Shareholders with the opportunity to effect a Silver Spike Share
Redemption in connection therewith as promptly as reasonably practicable after

adoption and approval of any other proposals as reasonably agreed by Silver
Spike, the Company and the Holder Representative to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the Merger and (ix) adjournment of the Silver

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

and vote upon the Transaction Proposals has been called and noticed, Silver
Spike will not postpone or adjourn the Silver Spike Extraordinary General
Meeting without the consent of the Company, other than (i) for the absence of
a quorum, in which event Silver Spike shall postpone the meeting up to three
(3) times for up to ten (10) Business Days each time, (ii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that Silver Spike has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal advisors, is necessary under applicable
Law, and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to
and reviewed by the holders of Silver Spike Ordinary Shares prior to the
Silver Spike Extraordinary General Meeting, or (iii) a one-time postponement
of up to ten (10) Business Days to solicit additional proxies from holders of
Silver Spike Ordinary Shares to the extent Silver Spike has determined that

and/or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or, in the case of Silver
Spike, the Silver Spike Board Recommendation. The Company shall promptly, and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of the date of this Agreement,

Subsidiaries or entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Transaction. For the
purposes hereof, "Acquisition Transaction" means, with respect to the
Company, any merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share

Silver Spike Parties had knowledge of it as of the date hereof; (b) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence,
as the case may be, could reasonably be expected to cause any condition set
forth in _Section 10.02_ or _Section 10.03_ not to be satisfied at any time
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; (c) any notice or
other communication from any third Person alleging that the consent of such
third Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (d) any regulatory notice,
report or results of inspection from a Governmental Authority in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (e) any information or

written acceptance thereof by the new Holder Representative.

  



  

Section 12.02   _Authority and Rights of the Holder
Representative; Limitations on Liability_.

  



  

(a)  The Holder Representative shall have full power and
authority on behalf of the Holders:

  



  

(i)  to act on behalf of each of them in the absolute
discretion of Holder Representative, including with the power to execute and
deliver any amendment or waiver respect to (or to terminate) this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement;

  



  

(ii)  to assert, and to agree to resolution of, any claim or
dispute under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and to take any and
all actions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, executing and delivering
any notices or documents, incurring any costs and expenses on behalf of the
Holders, making any and all determinations, negotiating, compromising,
settling, exercising, or refraining from exercising any remedies available to
the Holders, and signing any releases, agreements, or other documents, in each
case with respect to any such claim or dispute) that may be required or
permitted by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

(iii)  to engage and employ advisors, consultants, agents,
representatives, accountants, legal counsel, and other professionals and
incur such out-of-pocket fees, costs, and expenses as the Holder
Representative deems necessary or prudent in connection with the performance
of its duties under this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement;

  



  

(iv)  to make and receive notices and other communications
pursuant to this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement and service of process
in any Action arising out of or related to this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement;

  



  

(v)  (A) to cause or authorize amounts to be paid from the
Holder Representative Amount to satisfy the obligations of the Holders in
accordance with this Agreement and (B) to distribute any of the Holder
Representative Amount to the Holders at such time as the Holder
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, such amounts are no longer
required to be held in satisfaction of the Holders or Holder Representative's
obligations hereunder; and

  



  

(vi)  in general, to do all things and to perform all acts,
including executing and delivering all agreements, certificates,
receipts, instructions and other instruments contemplated by or deemed
advisable to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 12.02_.

  



  

(b)  The Silver Spike Parties and the Surviving Pubco will be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Holder by the Holder Representative, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Holder by the Holder Representative, as
being fully binding upon such Person. Any decision or action by the Holder
Representative hereunder, including any agreement between the Holder
Representative and any Silver Spike Party or the Surviving Pubco relating to
the defense, payment, or settlement of any claims hereunder, will constitute
a decision or action of all Holders and will be final, binding and conclusive
upon each such Person. No Holder will have the right to object to, dissent
from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Silver Spike Parties and the
Surviving Pubco will be entitled to rely upon any document or other paper
delivered by the Holder's Representative as (i) genuine and correct and (ii)
having been duly signed or sent by the Holder's Representative, and the Silver
Spike Parties and the Surviving Pubco will not be liable to any Holder or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Silver Spike Parties or the Surviving Pubco in such reliance.

  



  

(c)  The provisions of this Section 12.02 will be binding upon
the executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal
representatives, successor trustees, and successors of each Holder, and any
references in this Agreement to a Holder will mean and include the
successors to the Holder's rights hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

(d)  The Holders will indemnify and hold harmless the Holder
Representative against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by the Holder Representative in connection with any action, suit, or
proceeding to which the Holder Representative is made a party by reason of the
fact it is or was acting as the Holder Representative pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement and any expenses incurred by the Holder Representative
in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.

  



  

(e)  The Holder Representative will be entitled to the payment
by the Holders of all expenses incurred as the Holder Representative.

  



  

(f)  The Holder Representative will not have, by reason of
this Agreement, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Holder, except in
respect of amounts received hereunder on behalf of such Holder. The Holder
Representative will not be liable to any Holder for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other
document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Holder's
Representative will not be relieved of any liability imposed by Law for
willful misconduct. The Holder Representative will not be liable to the
Holders for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the
Holder's Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole
recourse of any Holder to whom payment was due, but not made, will be to
recover from other Holders any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to have been entitled. Neither the Holder Representative nor
any agent employed by it will incur any liability to any Holder by virtue of
the failure or refusal of the Holder Representative for any reason to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or
omissions constituting fraud or bad faith.

  



  

(g)  All of the rights, indemnities, immunities, and powers
granted to the Holder Representative under this Agreement will survive the
Closing.

Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 13.14(b) shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
