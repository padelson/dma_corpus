                  SECTION 2.2 Certain Actions Related to Conversion of
Securities.

                  (a) Parent Depository Shares.

                           (i) The Parent Depository Shares issued in connection
with the Merger shall be evidenced by one or more receipts ("Parent ADRs")
issued in accordance with the Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as
of October 24, 1995, among Parent, Citibank, N.A., as Depository (the

ADRs, as amended (the "Deposit Agreement"). As of the Effective Time, the
Company or Parent shall pay for all United Kingdom stamp duties, stamp duty
reserve tax and other similar taxes and similar levies imposed in connection
with the issuance or creation of the Parent Depository Shares to be issued in
the Merger and any Parent ADRs in connection therewith and any other United
Kingdom stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or other similar United Kingdom
governmental charge (or any interest or penalties thereon) that may be payable
by Parent and the Company pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. The Company and
Parent shall have the same obligation with respect to issuance of Parent
Depository Shares and Parent ADRs in connection with the exercise of any Company
Stock Options outstanding at the Effective Time that become exercisable for
Parent Depository Shares in accordance with Section 2.3(a). Subject to Section
2.6(f), no holder of Shares or Company Stock Options shall be obligated to pay
any fee or other charge or expense to the Depository in connection with the
issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares (or the related Parent Ordinary Share
Certificates) or Parent Depository Shares (or the related Parent ADRs) pursuant
to the Merger, upon exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding at the
Effective Time that become exercisable for Parent Depository Shares or Parent
Ordinary Shares in accordance with Section 2.3(a) or under a SMIP in accordance
with Section 2.3(d).

                           (ii) The cash payable, and the Parent Depository
Shares (or Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable) issuable, in respect of each
of the Shares pursuant to this Article II, are referred to as the "Merger
Consideration." From and after the Effective Time, the Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and, subject to Section 2.5(b), no holder of Shares shall have any
rights with respect thereto except the right to receive Merger Consideration in
respect of such Shares pursuant to this Article II and the right to receive
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.6(i), in each case
without interest and only upon compliance with the applicable provisions of this
Article II.

                           (iii) Parent Depository Shares and Parent Ordinary
Shares issued in connection with the Merger (or under Company Stock Options
outstanding at the Effective Time that become exercisable for Parent Depository
Shares or Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

with Section 2.3(a) or under a SMIP in accordance with Section 2.3(d)) will rank
pari passu in all respects with the outstanding Parent Depository Shares and
Parent Ordinary Shares at the time of issue.

                  (b) Adjustment of Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Common Shares,
Class B Shares or Parent Ordinary Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar
transaction, or Parent changes the number of Parent Ordinary Shares represented
by a Parent Depository Share, the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Exchange
Ratio, the Per Share Stock Consideration and any other dependent items, as the
case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Per Share Cash Consideration, Exchange Ratio or Per Share Stock
Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable, subject to further
adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

                  (c) Proration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary (but subject to Section 2.5):

                           (i) The Cash Percentage (as defined below) of the
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares) (such number, the "Cash Cap Number"), shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i), and all other Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. The "Cash Percentage" shall be equal
to 50%, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(c)(iv).

                           (ii) (x) if the aggregate number of Cash Electing
Shares (such number, the "Cash Election Number") exceeds the Cash Cap Number,
then (A) all Stock Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration and (B) the number
of Cash Electing Shares of each stockholder of the Company that shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Electing
Shares of such stockholder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash
Cap Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, with the
remaining number of such holder's Cash Electing Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

                                (y) if the Cash Election Number is less than the
Cash Cap Number (the number of Shares by which the Cash Election Number is less
than the Cash Cap Number, the "Shortfall Number"), then (A) all Cash Electing
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration and (B) the Stock Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

                                   (I) if the Shortfall Number is less than or
equal to the aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, then (X) all Stock
Electing Shares shall be converted

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration and (Y) the
Non-Electing Shares of each stockholder of the Company shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of that number
of Non-Electing Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
number of Non-Electing Shares of such stockholder by (2) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the
aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, with the remaining number of such
holder's Non-Electing Shares being converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration; or

                                   (II) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the
aggregate number of Non-Electing Shares, then (X) all Non-Electing Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and (Y)
the number of Stock Electing Shares of each stockholder of the Company that
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration
shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock
Electing Shares of such stockholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of
Non-Electing Shares and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
Stock Electing Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Electing
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

                           (iii) For purposes of the calculations in this
Section 2.2(c), Shares that constitute Dissenting Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares.

                           (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.2, the Cash Percentage shall be reduced (A) if the aggregate Per Share
Cash Consideration plus an amount equal to (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration
multiplied by (y) the sum of the number of Dissenting Shares, if any, and the
number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) (the product of (x) and (y) being referred to as the "Other
Shares Value") plus any other amounts paid by Parent (or any affiliate thereof)
to, or on behalf of, any holder of Shares (including any cash paid in lieu of
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depositary Shares) to the extent
such other amounts would be treated as exchanged for a "proprietary interest" in
the Company (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)) (such
other amounts together with the Other Shares Value, the "Other Consideration")
would represent more than 60% of the fair market value of the aggregate Merger
Consideration (with the Per Share Stock Consideration being valued on the basis
of the average of the high and low prices of a Parent Depositary Share on The
New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on the Closing Date) plus the Other
Consideration, to the minimum extent necessary so that the aggregate Per Share
Cash Consideration plus the Other Consideration equals 60% of the aggregate
value of the Merger Consideration (with the Per Share Stock Consideration being
valued on the basis of the average of the high and low prices of a Parent
Depositary Share on The New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on the Closing
Date) plus the Other Consideration, or (B) if otherwise necessary to permit the
delivery of the tax opinions referred to in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c), to the
minimum extent necessary to enable such opinions to be rendered. If the Cash
Percentage is reduced, Parent and the Company shall promptly announce the amount
of such reduction.

                           (i) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date
(as defined in Section 2.2(d)(ii)), is a record holder of Shares (other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to specify, in accordance with this Section
2.2(d), (x) the number of such holder's Shares (including Restricted Shares (as
defined in Section 2.3(c)) and, if the Shares to which the election relates are
represented by Certificates, the particular Shares, with respect to which such
holder makes a Cash Election and (y) the number of such holder's Shares
(including Restricted Shares) and, if the Shares to which the election relates
are represented by Certificates, the particular Shares, with respect to which
such holder makes a Stock Election.

                           (ii) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to
the Form F-4 (as defined in Section 6.2(a)) a form of election (the "Form of
Election") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form
of Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to any certificates representing Shares ("Certificates") shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and any Certificates. The Company
shall mail the Form of Election with the Company Proxy Statement (as defined in
Section 6.2(a)) to all persons who are record holders of Shares as of the record
date for the Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.1(a)). The Form of
Election shall be used by each record holder of Shares (or, in the case of
nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) who wishes to make a Cash Election and/or a Stock Election for
any or all Shares (including Restricted Shares) held by such holder. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election, together
with a copy of the Company Proxy Statement, available to all persons who become
record holders of Shares during the period between the record date for the
Stockholders Meeting and the Election Date. Any holder's Election shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.6(a))
shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on (A) the date of the Stockholders Meeting or (B) if the Closing Date is more
than four business days following the Stockholders Meeting, the date that is two
business days prior to the Closing Date (the "Election Date"), a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and, if the Shares to which the Cash
Election and/or Stock Election relate are represented by Certificates, the Form
of Election shall have been accompanied by Certificates representing those
Shares duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on
the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is an
"eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")); provided,
that, such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time
set forth in such guarantee of delivery). After a Cash Election or a Stock
Election is validly and properly made with respect to any Shares, no further
registration of transfers of such Shares shall be made on the stock transfer
books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election is
properly revoked in accordance with Section 2.2(d)(iii). Parent and the Company
shall announce the anticipated Election Date at least five business days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent
date, the Election Date shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and
Parent and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when
determined, the rescheduled Election Date.

<PAGE>

                           (iii) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be
revoked with respect to all or a portion of the Shares subject thereto by the
holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice received
by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election
Date. In addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be
revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII. If a
Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to Shares represented by
Certificates, Certificates representing such Shares shall be promptly returned
to the holder that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent.

                           (iv) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the
determination of Parent, after reasonable consultation with the Company, in the
event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be
conclusive and binding as to whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections
shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2(d) and as
to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections and revocations were received by the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Parent, after reasonable consultation
with the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the
following computation) shall also make all computations as to the proration
contemplated by Section 2.2(c), and absent manifest error this computation shall
be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of
Parent, after Parent's reasonable consultation with the Company, make any rules
as are consistent with this Section 2.2(d) for the implementation of the Cash
Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be
necessary or desirable to effect these Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

                           (v) To the extent practicable, the Form of Election
shall permit each holder that beneficially owns Shares and/or whose affiliates
beneficially own Shares in more than one name or account to specify how to
allocate the Per Share Cash Consideration and Parent Depository Shares or Parent
Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, to be issued in the Merger among the
various accounts that such holder of Shares beneficially owns and, with the
requisite consent of such holder's affiliates, among the accounts beneficially
owned by such holder and its affiliates.

                  SECTION 2.3 Options; Restricted Stock; SMIP.

                  (a) The Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate
committee thereof shall take all action necessary under the applicable Company
Stock Plans (as defined in Section 3.3(a)) so that (1) each option to purchase
Shares held by an employee, director, or former employee or former director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a "Company Stock Option")
outstanding at the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to
represent a right to acquire Shares, (2) (x) each Company Stock Option held by a
person whose primary place of residence or employment with the Company or any of

Time for Good Reason (as defined below) or his or her employment with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries terminates as a result of his

upon such termination and exercisable, in the case of a termination not for
Cause or for Good Reason, for a period of thirty days following such termination
and, in the case of a termination on account of death or disability, for a
period of one year following such termination, and (4) except as expressly set

Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) five times
the Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(b)),
rounded up or down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares, and
(ii) the exercise price per Parent Ordinary Share under each Europe Company
Stock Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the

adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(b)), rounded up or down to the nearest
cent. From and after the Effective Time, (i) the number of Parent Depository
Shares purchasable upon exercise of each outstanding Non-Europe Company Stock
Option shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
Shares that were purchasable upon exercise of that Non-Europe Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio
(subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(b)), rounded up or down to the

Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on an appropriate form
or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement under
the Securities Act prior to the Effective Time so that Parent shall have
available from and after the Effective Time the number of Parent Depository
Shares and Parent Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of Non-Europe
Company Stock Options as provided in Section 2.3(a) or issuable to a Stock
Participant who is not a European Person in accordance with Section 2.3(d), and
shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause such registration statement or
post-effective amendment to become effective and comply, to the extent
applicable, with state securities or "blue sky" laws with respect thereto, at
the Effective Time, and (ii) maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained therein, as well as comply with any applicable state securities or
"blue sky" laws, for so long as those options remain outstanding. In addition,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to do all such things as are
required under applicable laws and regulations for the Parent Ordinary Shares
issuable upon exercise of Company Stock Options or under the SMIPs to be
admitted to the official list (the "Official List") maintained by the U.K.
Listing Authority (the "UKLA") and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc
(the "LSE").

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding Share subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Restricted Shares") shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Per Share
Stock Consideration in accordance with this Article II; provided, however, that,
(i) all Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depository Shares issuable upon
conversion of a Restricted Share shall be subject to the same terms (including
vesting terms) as applicable to the Restricted Share in respect of which they
are issued and (ii) all cash amounts (including any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent Depository Shares to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.6(k)) payable upon conversion of a Restricted Share shall be subject
to the same terms (including vesting terms) as applicable to the Restricted
Share in respect of which they are payable and shall be paid to the holder
thereof, at such time as such applicable vesting or other restrictions lapse,
together with simple annual interest on such cash amount accruing from the
Effective Time until such lapse at a rate of two percent per annum; provided
further, however, that, if the employment of a holder of a Restricted Share is

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

involuntarily terminated by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
after the Effective Time other than for Cause or the holder terminates his or
her employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries after
the Effective Time for Good Reason, in either case, all of the Parent Ordinary
Shares, Parent Depositary Shares, and/or cash payable in respect of converted
Restricted Shares then held by such holder shall become fully vested and, in the
case of cash (including interest), be paid out, upon such termination. Holders
of Restricted Shares shall be entitled to make a Cash Election (or receive a
Form of Election) with respect to such Shares. The Board of Directors of the
Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all action necessary
under the applicable Company Stock Plans to implement the foregoing with respect
to the Restricted Shares.

                  (d) The Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate
committee thereof shall take all action necessary under the Company's 1998
Senior Management Incentive Plan or 2003 Senior Management Incentive Plan
(together, the "SMIPs") so that, at the Effective Time, (i) the Stock
Accumulated Account of each Stock Participant (both as defined in the applicable
SMIP) shall be adjusted so that (x) the Stock Accumulated Account of each Stock
Participant that is a European Person shall have allocated or credited to it
that number of Parent Ordinary Shares that is equal to (A) five times the
Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(b)) multiplied
by (B) the number of Shares allocated or credited to the Stock Accumulated
Account of such Stock Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time (and,
with respect to such Stock Participant, for the period from and after the
Effective Time, all references to "Stock" in the applicable SMIP shall be deemed
to refer to Parent Ordinary Shares and all references to the Company in the
applicable SMIP shall be deemed to refer to Parent), (y) the Stock Accumulated
Account of each Stock Participant that is not a European Person shall have
allocated or credited to it that number of Parent Depository Shares equal to the
Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(b)) multiplied
by the number of Shares allocated or credited to the Stock Accumulated Account
of such Stock Participant immediately prior to the Effective Time (and, with
respect to such Stock Participant, for the period from and after the Effective
Time, all references to "Stock" in the applicable SMIP shall be deemed to refer
to Parent Depository Shares and all references to the Company in the applicable
SMIP shall be deemed to refer to Parent), (ii) if the employment of a
Participant (as defined in the applicable SMIP) is involuntarily terminated by
the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries after the Effective Time
other than for Cause or the Participant terminates his or her employment with
the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries after the Effective Time
for Good Reason, in either case, the Contingent Account of the Participant shall
become a Vested Account (both as defined in the applicable SMIP) upon such
termination and (iii) except as expressly set forth in this Section 2.3(d), from
and after the Effective Time, the SMIPs shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions (including, subject to the prior clause (ii), the vesting terms)
applicable thereto immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (e) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that, except as expressly provided in this Section 2.3, none of the
execution of this Agreement, the performance by the parties of their obligations
hereunder, or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall give rise to (i) accelerated vesting or
exercisability of any Company Stock Options, (ii) vesting of any Restricted
Shares, (iii) vesting of, or payments to participants from, account balances
under the SMIP or (iv) vesting of account balances in the Company's Employee
Stock Ownership Plan.

                  SECTION 2.4 Convertible Debentures. Pursuant to Section 11.11
of the Indenture, dated as of October 28, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the
Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Trustee, relating to the
Company's 5.0% Contingent Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2033 (the
"Convertible Debentures"), prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take such
action as required under such section to establish the right of the holders of
the Convertible Debentures to convert each Convertible Debenture after the
Effective Time, to the extent otherwise convertible pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, into the amount and type of Merger Consideration paid or issued
pursuant to the Merger in respect of such number of Non-Electing Shares that is
equal to the number of Common Shares into which such Convertible Debenture would
have been convertible absent consummation of the Merger. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, deliver to the holders of the Convertible Debentures appropriate notices
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Indenture with respect
thereto to the extent required by the terms thereof and any other notices
required by the terms of the Indenture as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall comply with the terms of the Indenture with
respect to the making of an offer to purchase Convertible Debentures from the
holders thereof as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, if required
by the terms of the Indenture.

                  SECTION 2.5 Dissenting Shares.

                  (a) Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of Shares who have not voted
in favor of or consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded and
perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, however, that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to
perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholder's rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder's Shares in respect of which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective
Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable or issuable in
respect of Non-Electing Shares without any interest thereon.

                  (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares,
withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters'
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree,
ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment with
respect to any such exercise of dissenters' rights or offer to settle or settle
any such rights.

                  SECTION 2.6 Surrender of Shares.

                  (a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not
less than three business days prior to the mailing of the Company Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates or Shares represented by book-entry
("Book-Entry Shares"), for Parent ADRs, certificates representing Parent
Ordinary Shares ("Parent Ordinary Share Certificates"), as applicable, and/or
cash consideration (including cash payable in lieu of fractional interests in
Parent Depository Shares or Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable, in accordance
with Section 2.6(k)).

                  (b) The Exchange Agent shall act as the agent for each holder
of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder shall become
entitled to receive with respect to such holder's Shares pursuant to this
Article II.

                  (c) Parent shall deposit, or cause the Depository to deposit,
with the Exchange Agent, from time to time, (i) that number of Parent ADRs and
Parent Ordinary Share Certificates, as applicable, in any denominations as the
Exchange Agent shall specify and (ii) cash, in each case as are issuable or
payable, respectively, pursuant to this Article II in respect of Shares for
which Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the
Exchange Agent.

                  (d) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective
Time, of Non-Electing Shares (these holders, "Non-Electing Holders"), (i) a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder representing
such Non-Electing Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares, for payment of the
Merger Consideration therefor.

                  (e) Each stockholder who properly made and did not revoke a
Cash Election or Stock Election shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
such stockholder's Electing Shares, and upon surrender by a Non-Electing Holder
to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the Non-Electing Holder shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, (i) the number of whole Parent
Depository Shares (or Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable), if any, into which
such holder's Shares represented by such holder's properly surrendered
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance
with this Article II, and (ii) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after
giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 2.6(l)) equal to
(A) the amount of cash (including the Per Share Cash Consideration and cash in
lieu of fractional interests in Parent Depository Shares (or Parent Ordinary
Shares, as applicable) to be paid pursuant to Section 2.6(k)), if any, into
which such holder's Shares represented by such holder's properly surrendered
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance
with this Article II, plus (B) any cash dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(i).

<PAGE>

                  (f) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment or
issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment or issuance that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment or issuance shall have paid to the Exchange Agent
any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective
Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.

                  (g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
II.

                  (h) Any Parent Depository Shares (or Parent Ordinary Shares,
as applicable) to be issued and any cash to be paid in respect of Shares
(including any cash in lieu of fractional interests in Parent Depository Shares
(or Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable) to be paid pursuant to Section
2.6(k), plus any cash dividend or other distribution that a former holder of
Shares has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(i)) pursuant to this
Article II, that remains unclaimed by any former holder of Shares nine months
after the Effective Time shall be held by the Exchange Agent (or a successor
agent appointed by Parent) or shall be delivered to Parent (and/or to the
Depository upon the instruction of Parent and held by the Depository subject to
the instruction of Parent in an account or accounts designated for this
purpose). Parent shall not be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
securities properly delivered or any amount properly paid by the Depository, the
Exchange Agent or its nominee, as the case may be, to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares has not been surrendered prior to two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to an earlier date on which the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in
Section 3.5(b)), any cash, share dividends and distributions otherwise payable
in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                  (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Depository Shares (or Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable), issuable with
respect to the Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are surrendered as provided in this Article II. Upon surrender, there shall be
issued and/or paid to the holder of the Parent Depository Shares (or Parent
Ordinary Shares, as applicable), issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(A) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to those Parent Depository Shares (or

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable) with a record date on or after the date
of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this
surrender and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those Parent Depository
Shares (and Parent Ordinary Shares, as applicable) with a record date on or
after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
surrender.

                  (j) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the holder's compliance with the replacement
requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the
posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented
by the Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

                  (k) Each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to receive a
fractional interest in a Parent Depository Share or Parent Ordinary Share, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms of this Article II, shall be entitled to
receive, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.6(k), a cash
payment (without interest) in lieu of that fractional interest in a Parent
Depository Share (or Parent Ordinary Share, as applicable) determined by
multiplying the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by (x) in the case of a fractional interest in a Parent Ordinary Share,
the closing price for a Parent Ordinary Share as reported on the Daily Official
List of the LSE on the first trading day following the date on which the
Effective Time occurs and (y) in the case of a fractional interest in a Parent
Depository Share, the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) multiplied by 5.
Any cash payment in lieu of a fractional interest shall be made in U.S. dollars,
in the case of a Parent Depository Share, and U.K. pounds sterling, in the case
of a Parent Ordinary Share.

                  (l) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares pursuant
to this Agreement any amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of this payment under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the Surviving
Corporation shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the
type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Shares, sold this consideration for an amount of cash equal to the
fair market value of the consideration at the time of the deemed sale and paid
these cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

                  (m) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with
the Exchange Agent by Parent (or caused to be deposited by Parent), as directed
by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Per Share Cash Consideration payable to holders of Shares entitled to receive
such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests, as provided in
Section 2.6(k), and Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Shares entitled to receive such
consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest or income produced
by such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
Parent directs.

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and

to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") and
except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.7(a))
filed or furnished prior to the date of this Agreement (but excluding the

sections of any such Company SEC Report):

                  SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The

and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below) and (y) would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the ability of the Company to consummate
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and
is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the conduct of its business or the nature of its

or in the aggregate, (x) has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) would not reasonably be expected
to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event or effect that has
been or would be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,

economic conditions (except to the extent that those changes, events or effects
have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its subsidiaries
relative to other participants in the advertising industry), (ii) the
announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any termination of, or reduction in, client business due to the
announcement and performance of this Agreement or the identity of the parties to
this Agreement, or the performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including compliance with the covenants contained herein,
(iii) changes in general conditions in the advertising industry (except to the
extent that those changes, events or effects have a materially disproportionate
effect on the Company and its subsidiaries relative to other participants in the
advertising industry), (iv) changes in any tax laws or regulations or applicable
accounting regulations or principles (except to the extent that those changes,
events or effects have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and
its subsidiaries relative to other participants in the advertising industry) or
(v) only with respect to the clients listed on Section 3.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the impact of any change

                                      -16-

in client business publicly announced by the Company or such client prior to the
date of this Agreement; provided that the exception set forth in clause (ii)
shall not apply with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.4 and 3.5 or the absence of conflict or similar representations set
forth in Section 3.10(j) or with respect to any failure by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to take any action prohibited by Section 5.1 for which the
consent of Parent is properly withheld).

                  SECTION 3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The
Company has heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent a true,
complete and correct copy of the restated certificate of incorporation (the
"Certificate of Incorporation") and the by-laws (the "By-Laws") of the Company,
in each case as currently in effect. The Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws of the Company, as so made available, are in full force and effect and
no other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company.
The Company is not in violation of any provisions of its Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws in any material respect.

                  SECTION 3.3 Capitalization.

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
(i) 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class B Common

are no outstanding options, warrants or other outstanding rights of any kind
which obligate the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue or deliver any

obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for any shares of
capital stock or voting securities of the Company.

                  (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(a), there are no
preemptive rights of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its

obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
person a right to subscribe for or acquire from the Company or its subsidiaries,
any shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company. Except as set
forth above, the Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are

this Agreement, each such Company Stock Option has the exercise price, is
subject to the vesting schedule, has an exercise period, and is held by the
holder set forth with respect thereto, as set forth in Section 3.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. As of the date of this Agreement, each outstanding
Restricted Share is subject to the vesting schedule and held by the holder set

to such participant's Contingent Account or Vested Account (both as defined in
the applicable SMIP), as applicable, and the Allocation Amount (as defined in
the applicable SMIP) for such participant for each uncompleted Plan Year (as
defined in the applicable SMIP).

                  As used herein, the term "Significant Subsidiary" shall mean
any subsidiary listed on Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
aggregate annual revenues of the Significant Subsidiaries of the Company for the
year ended December 31, 2003 represented at least 75% of the consolidated annual
revenues of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2003.

                  (c) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock, other
ownership interests and other voting securities of each of the Company's
Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and all such shares, other ownership interests and voting
securities are owned by the Company or another wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, in each case, free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights, charges or other encumbrances
of any nature whatsoever, except where any such failure to own any such shares,
ownership interests or voting securities free and clear, has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption
rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, call, commitments or rights
of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue or
deliver any shares of capital stock, other ownership interests or voting
securities of any Significant Subsidiary or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any person a
right to subscribe for or acquire from the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
any shares of capital stock, other ownership interests or voting securities in
any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, except as would not have, or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the

<PAGE>

Employment Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Employment Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder or to

of the outstanding Shares and (ii) the holders of not less than two-thirds of
the outstanding Shares (the "Merger Requisite Votes"), and the filing with the

been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery hereof and thereof by the other
parties hereto and thereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing. The Board of Directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly
adopted at a meeting duly called and held, (A) approved this Agreement and the
Employment Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, (B) declared the advisability of this Agreement, and (C) subject to
Section 6.1(b), recommended that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the

                  (b) As of September 1, 2004, to the knowledge of the Company,
the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of not less than two thirds of the
outstanding Shares will constitute adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
a majority of the outstanding Shares, excluding Shares beneficially owned by
directors, officers or employees of the Company.

                  SECTION 3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                  (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Employment Agreement by the Company do not and will not (i) conflict
with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, (ii)
conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or comparable
constituent documents of the subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations and permits contemplated
by clauses (i) through (vii) of subsection (b) below have been obtained, and all
filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties
are bound, or (iv) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license or other instrument or
obligation ("Contracts") to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and
(iv) above, for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, acceleration,
loss, right or other

                                      -19-

occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, (x) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y)
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the Company's ability to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Employment Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the Company, do not and will not
require any consent, approval, authorization, declaration or permit of, action
by, filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including
stock exchange) authority, agency, court, commission, or other governmental body
(each, a "Governmental Entity"), except for (i) applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and state securities, takeover and "blue
sky" laws, (ii) the applicable requirements of the Nasdaq, (iii) the filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as

notification in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004, the E.C.

authority of any member state of the European Union to which any of the

the ECMR, (vi) the applicable requirements of antitrust, competition or other
similar laws, rules, regulations and judicial doctrines of jurisdictions other
than the United States and the European Union or of investment laws relating to
foreign ownership (collectively, "Foreign Antitrust Laws") and (vii) any such
consent, approval, authorization, declaration, permit, action, filing or
notification the failure of which to make or obtain, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to, (A) prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the Company's ability to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Employment Agreement or (B)
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.6 Compliance. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in violation of, or has violated, any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
subject or by which its or any of their respective properties are bound, except
for any such violation which would not have, or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, authorizations,
exemptions, orders, consents, approvals and franchises ("Licenses") from
Governmental Entities required to conduct their respective businesses as now
being conducted and all such Licenses are valid and in full force and effect,
except for any such Licenses the failure of which to have or to be in full force
and effect has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                  (a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms,
reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC
since January 1, 2002 (all such

<PAGE>

forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC since January 1, 2002, whether or not required to be filed,
collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"). Each of the Company SEC Reports, as
amended, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. None
of the Company SEC Reports, when filed as amended, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. There are no outstanding comments from the SEC with
respect to any of the Company SEC Reports.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries (including the related notes and schedules)
included in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto). Each of the consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
subsidiaries included in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof and each of the related consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and changes in stockholders' equity included in the Company SEC Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, in all material
respects, the results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal period-end adjustments).

                  (c) The Company has (x) designed and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the management of the Company by
others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation, to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. A summary of any of those disclosures made by management to the
Company's auditors and audit committee has been made available to Parent.

                  SECTION 3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From
December 31, 2003 (and with respect to periods after the date of this Agreement,
except as expressly contemplated hereby), the Company and its subsidiaries have,
in all material respects, conducted their businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary
course of these businesses. From December 31, 2003, there has not been (i) any
change in the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries except those changes that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution in cash, stock or property in

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

respect of the Company's capital stock or any securities convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable for or into shares of its capital stock, except for
(x) regular quarterly cash dividends of no more than $1.00 per Share and (y)
interest payments in respect of the Convertible Debentures in accordance with
their terms; (iii) any redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of any shares
of capital stock or ownership interests of the Company of any of its
subsidiaries or any securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for or
into shares of capital stock or ownership interests of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries other than acquisitions of Restricted Shares at their applicable
original cost, pursuant to the terms of any Company Stock Plan or any employment
agreement listed in Section 3.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, or (iv) any
material change by the Company in its accounting principles, practices or
methods except as required by changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Between December 31, 2003 and the date of this Agreement, there has
been no corporate directive or authorization from the Company to increase
compensation payable or which could become payable to any employees of the
Company that has been made as a result of or in contemplation of a change of
control of the Company or its subsidiaries, and between December 31, 2003 and
the date of this Agreement, there have not been any material alterations or
changes in overall compensation and benefit practices and plans of the Company
or its subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 3.9 Absence of Litigation.

                  There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits,
claims, hearings, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the
executive officers of the Company, except, in each case, for those that,
individually or in the aggregate, (x) have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) would not reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the Company's
ability to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their
respective properties is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award, except for those that, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the Company's ability to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
There are no formal or informal SEC inquiries or investigations, other
governmental inquiries or investigations or internal investigations or material
whistle-blower complaints pending or, to the knowledge of the Company with
respect to SEC or other governmental inquiries or investigations, threatened, in
each case regarding any accounting or disclosure practices of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any executive officer of the Company.

                  SECTION 3.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (a) Except as set forth herein, Section 3.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of each material "employee
benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), but excluding any plan that
is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), and each other

post-employment or retirement benefits, employment agreement or other employee
benefits of any kind, whether funded or unfunded, contributed to, sponsored or
maintained by the Company or any of its United States or United Kingdom
subsidiaries or any of its Germany subsidiaries (but only with respect to
pension plans that are sponsored by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that
are maintained in Germany ("Germany Pension Plans")), in each case under which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has any liability, contingent or
otherwise, for the benefit of any current, former, or retired employee, officer,
consultant, independent contractor, agent or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Employees") and which covers any
Company Employee employed or providing services or formerly employed or
providing services in the United States, the United Kingdom or Germany to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (such plans, programs, policies, agreements
and arrangements, collectively, "Company Plans"). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Foreign Benefit Plan" shall refer to each material plan,
program or agreement contributed to, sponsored or maintained by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries that is maintained outside of the United States and the
United Kingdom (other than Germany Pension Plans), or that covers primarily
employees residing or working outside the United States and the United Kingdom
(other than Germany Pension Plans), and which would have been treated as a
Company Plan had it been a material United States or United Kingdom plan,
program or agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
available to Parent, within thirty (30) days following the date of this
Agreement, a list and copies of Foreign Benefit Plans as well as any Company
Plans not previously provided or made available to Parent.

                  (b) With respect to each Company Plan not described in the

received from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), (iii) any summary plan
description and (iv) for the two most recent years (A) the Form 5500 and

                  (c) Except as have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each Company Plan has been established and administered in accordance

rules and regulations and where applicable to a Company Plan, the Company, its
subsidiaries and its ERISA affiliates (as defined below) have complied with the
minimum funding requirements under Section 412 of the Code and Section 302 of
ERISA with respect to each Company Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA

business or entity which is a member of a "controlled group of corporations,"
under "common control" or an "affiliated service group" with the Company or

Code, or required to be aggregated with the Company or Parent, as applicable,
under Section 414(o) of

                                      -23-

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Company, any of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA affiliate (i)

multiemployer plan (within the meaning of ERISA sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3))
and (iii) has at any time sponsored, contributed to, or had any liability or
obligation in respect of, any multiemployer plan.

                  (e) Except as have not had, and would not reasonably be

Effect, (i) neither the Company, any of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA affiliate
has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied
in full, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that
presents a risk to the Company of incurring any such liability other than
liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which
premiums have been paid when due).

of the Code is so qualified and has been so qualified during the six-year period
preceding the execution of this Agreement and has received a determination
letter to that effect from the Internal Revenue Service and each trust forming a
part thereof is exempt from federal income tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the
Code and, to the knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist which could
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect qualification or
exemption.

                  (h) Except as have not had, and would not have reasonably be

Effect, all Foreign Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained in accordance with
all applicable requirements; (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, meet all requirements for that treatment; and (iii) if they are
intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are appropriately funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

                  (i) Any United States Company Plan listed on Schedule 3.10(a)
that provides post-retirement medical benefits is marked with an asterisk.

                  (j) The execution, delivery of and performance by the Company
of its obligations under and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) (i) constitute an event under any Company Plan or any trust
or loan related to any of those plans or agreements that will or may result in
any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee, (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, constitute an event under any Foreign Benefit Plan or
any trust or loan related to any of those plans that will or may result in

fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee that would be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or (iii) result in the triggering or imposition of (x) any restrictions
or limitations on the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to amend
or terminate any Company Plan, or (y) result in "excess parachute payments"

a Company Material Adverse Effect, there is no commitment covering any Company
Employee that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to the payment of any amount that would result in a loss of tax
deductions pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.

                  (k) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of its ERISA affiliates relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan which would
increase the expense to the Company and its Subsidiaries of maintaining the plan
or agreement above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the
12 months ended on December 31, 2003, except as have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Restricted Shares under any Company Stock Plan to any person who was not a
Common Law Employee or director of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company or
a director of the Company as of the date of grant. "Common Law Employee" shall
mean any individual considered an employee of the Company under applicable law
and shall exclude, without limitation, any contractors or self-employed

certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing to be brought or filed, with the
National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or
authority. Except as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,

subsidiaries are in full force and effect and provide insurance in such amounts
and against such risks as the management of the Company reasonably has
determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices or as is required
by law. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in material breach or

UKLA since January 1, 2002 (all such forms, reports, statements, certificates
and other documents filed by Parent with the SEC or UKLA since January 1, 2002,
whether or not required to be filed, collectively, the "Parent Reports"). Each
of the Parent Reports, as amended, complied as to form in all material respects
with applicable statutory requirements and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Parent Reports,
when filed as amended, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. There are
no outstanding comments from the SEC or UKLA with respect to any of the Parent
Reports.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Parent
and its subsidiaries (including the related notes and schedules) included in the
Parent Reports have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United Kingdom ("U.K. GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis through the periods involved except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto. The related notes reconciling to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles the consolidated financial statements of Parent, or any
portion thereof, as applicable, comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the SEC applicable to this reconciliation. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets of Parent and its subsidiaries included in the
Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and each of the related
consolidated income statements, statements of cash flows and statements of
shareowner funds included in the Parent Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, the results of operations
and cash flows of Parent and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal period-end
adjustments).

                  (c) Parent has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Parent by others within those
entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of
Parent (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
in any material respect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal
control over financial reporting.

convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for or into share of its capital stock,

                  SECTION 4.10 Tax Treatment. Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action or failed to take any
action, and to the knowledge of Parent no person has taken or failed to take any
action which would jeopardize the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code or the ability of counsel to
render the opinions described in Sections 7.2(d) and 7.3(c).

                  SECTION 4.11 Financing. Parent and Merger Sub will have
available to them, at the Effective Time, immediately available funds (including

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses.

                  SECTION 4.12 Operations of Merger Sub. Prior to the Effective

approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.
The vote or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall

None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates is required to obtain the
advice of any works council or workers council or similar body in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
financing thereof.

                  SECTION 4.15 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of
Parent prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the audited balance sheet of Parent
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 (including the notes thereto), (ii)

Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company.

applicable law, or unless Parent shall otherwise agree in writing, the business

and consistent with past practice and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to preserve intact its business organization, and to preserve its
present relationships and goodwill with employees, clients, suppliers,

practicable after the filing. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the effective date of the Form F-4, all necessary state
securities law or "blue sky" permits or approvals required to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice, of the time when the Form F-4 has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Depository Shares
or Parent Ordinary Shares issuable and deliverable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of Parent and the Company shall
as soon as reasonably practicable notify the other of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Form F-4 or the Company Proxy
Statement, any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Form F-4 or the
Company Proxy Statement, or for additional information.

                  (b) The Company and Parent each agree, as to itself and its
subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or
its subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form F-4 or
the Company Proxy Statement will, at the time the Form F-4 becomes effective
under the Securities Act, or, in the case of the Company Proxy Statement, at the
date of mailing to the Company's stockholders and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which should be set forth in an amendment and/or a supplement to the Form F-4 or
the Company Proxy Statement, so that the Form F-4 or the Company Proxy Statement
would not, at the time the Form F-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act,
or, in the case of the Company Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing to the
Company's stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers this information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the
extent required by law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing that
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC or any other applicable
Governmental Entity and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
Company's stockholders.

                  (c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective.

                  (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and stockholders, as
applicable, and any other matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection
with the Form F-4 or the Company Proxy Statement (including information required
to be set forth therein as required by the Securities Act or Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) or any other filing, notice,
statement, registration, submission of information or application required to be
made by or on behalf of the Company or Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries to any third-party and/or Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement and the Employment Agreement.

                  (e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and Parent shall
promptly prepare and file with the UKLA listing particulars relating to Parent
and its subsidiaries and the Parent Ordinary Shares (the "Parent Listing
Particulars"), if required under the UKLA listing rules, and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain formal approval by the UKLA of the Parent
Listing Particulars as soon as practicable and, in connection therewith, Parent
will supply all such information, give all such undertakings, execute all such
documents, pay all such fees and do or procure to be done all such things as may
be necessary or required by the UKLA for the purposes of obtaining such approval

                  (f) Parent agrees, as to itself and its subsidiaries, that the
Parent Listing Particulars will contain all particulars required to comply in
all material respects with all applicable statutory and other legal provisions
and Parent agrees that all information contained in the Parent Listing
Particulars with respect to itself and its subsidiaries will be in accordance
with the facts and will not omit anything likely to affect the import of that
information. The Company agrees that all such information supplied by the
Company for inclusion in the Parent Listing Particulars with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries will be substantially in accordance with the facts
and will not omit anything likely to affect the import of that information. If
required, Parent will prepare (with the cooperation of the Company) a summary of
the Parent Listing Particulars, which shall comprise a fair summary of the key
information set out in the Parent Listing Particulars, to be included in the
Company Proxy Statement.

                  SECTION 6.3 Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of
the resignation of all directors of the Company and, as specified by Parent
reasonably in advance of the Closing, all directors of each subsidiary of the
Company, in each case, effective at the Effective Time.

                  SECTION 6.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From
the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this
Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries, officers, directors
and employees to, afford the officers, employees, auditors and other authorized
representatives of Parent reasonable access, consistent with applicable law, at
all reasonable times to its officers, employees, properties, offices, plants and
other facilities and to all books

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

and records, and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating and other
data and information as Parent, through its officers, employees or authorized
representatives, may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its clients, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company
or its subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement;
provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
contractual waivers and consents and implement requisite procedures to enable
the provision of access and disclosure without such violations, prejudices or
contraventions. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

                  (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will
cause its officers, employees, auditors and other authorized representatives to
hold and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning the
Company and its subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 7, 2004, between the Company and Parent
(the "Company Confidentiality Agreement"), which Company Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

                  (c) The Company will hold and treat and will cause its
officers, employees, auditors and other authorized representatives to hold and
treat in confidence all documents and information concerning Parent and its
subsidiaries furnished to the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated August 31, 2004, between the Company and Parent (the "Parent
Confidentiality Agreement", and together with the Company Confidentiality
Agreement, the "Confidentiality Agreements"), which Parent Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

                  SECTION 6.5 Acquisition Proposals.

                  (a) The Company agrees that (i) it and its officers and
directors shall not, (ii) its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries' officers and
directors shall not, and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that its and its subsidiaries' investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, employees, consultants or other agents, advisors or
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") shall not, (A) directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries
or the making, submission or reaffirmation of any proposal or offer with respect
to a tender offer or exchange offer, merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation or other business combination involving the Company and its
subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner an equity
interest representing a 20% or greater economic or voting interest in the
Company, or the assets, securities or ownership interests of or in the Company
or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter
referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (B) directly or indirectly, engage
in any negotiations

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties, books and
records or any confidential information or data to, any person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to Section 6.5(b), neither the Company nor its
Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall recommend to its stockholders
any Acquisition Proposal or approve or enter any agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (provided that neither the Company nor
its Board of Directors may recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless permitted
by Section 6.5(b) below and the Company may not fail to make or withdraw, modify
or change in a manner adverse to Parent all or any portion of the Company Board
Recommendation unless permitted by Section 6.1(b), and provided further that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication by the Company or its Board of Directors to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer containing the substance
of a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to such Rule 14d-9(f)) shall
not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in
any manner adverse to Parent of, all or a portion of the Company Board of
Recommendation) or (ii) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders in accordance with this Agreement, (A) providing access to its
properties, books and records and providing information or data in response to a
request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the party so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
substantially similar to those contained in the Company Confidentiality
Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the
Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and it
being understood that the Company may enter into a confidentiality agreement
without a standstill provision or with a standstill provision less favorable to
the Company if it waives or similarly modifies the standstill provision in the
Company Confidentiality Agreement), or (B) engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking any of the
actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B) of clause (ii), (x) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such action is
necessary in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law and that such Acquisition Proposal will result in,
or could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal
from the party that made the applicable Acquisition Proposal, and (y) the
Company shall have informed Parent promptly following (and in no event later
than 24 hours after) the taking by it of any such action. A "Superior Proposal"
means an Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably capable of being consummated,
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing, and similar
aspects of, and conditions to, the proposal, the likelihood of obtaining
necessary financing and the person making the proposal, and, if consummated,
would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders from
a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response to

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

such Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take the necessary steps promptly to inform the persons set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.5(a) of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.5.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders in accordance with this Agreement, the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from
a breach of Section 6.5(a), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal and that
terminating this Agreement to accept such Superior Proposal and/or recommending
such Superior Proposal to the stockholders of the Company is necessary in order
for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, the Company may terminate this Agreement and/or its Board of Directors may
recommend such Superior Proposal to its stockholders, as applicable; provided,
however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination pursuant to
this Section 6.5(b) the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.2(b); and provided, further, however, that the Company
shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement and the Board of
Directors shall not recommend a Superior Proposal to its stockholders pursuant
to this Section 6.5(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior
written notice advising Parent that the Company or its Board of Directors
intends to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, specifying in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal,
this notice to be delivered not less than three business days prior to the time
the action is taken, and, during this three business day period, the Company and
its advisors shall negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

                  (c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also
shall, if it has not already done so, promptly request, to the extent it has a
contractual right to do so, that each person, if any, that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date of
this Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal
to return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished
to any person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries.

                  (d) Promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
directors, officers or Representatives of an Acquisition Proposal, or if any
non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, its subsidiaries or any
of its or their respective directors, officers or Representatives, the Company
shall provide Parent with written notice of the material terms and conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal or the identity of any party requesting non-public
information or seeking discussions or negotiations, and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers. The Company shall make available to
Parent (to the extent

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

it has not previously done so) all nonpublic information made available to any
person making an Acquisition Proposal.

                  SECTION 6.6 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.

                  (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company
Employee may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2005, to maintain the existing
severance plans of the Company and any subsidiary of the Company and to provide
the severance payments and benefits required thereunder in accordance with the
terms of such plans to be provided to any Company Employee terminated during
that period. In respect of the annual bonus payable to the Company Employees for
service rendered in fiscal year 2004, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to honor the terms and conditions of and obligations
(existing as of the date of this Agreement) under the Company's year 2004 annual
bonus program and the award or participation agreements thereunder (the "2004
Bonus Program"), which 2004 Bonus Program shall be administered in a manner
consistent with the Company's historic annual bonus programs. Aggregate annual
discretionary bonuses and SMIP allocations for 2004 shall be made in accordance
with Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                  (b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company
Employee may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2005, to maintain for Company
Employees (i) welfare, pension benefits, base salary and incentive-based
benefits or compensation (but not equity-based benefits or compensation) that in
the aggregate are no less favorable than the overall welfare, pension benefits,
base salary and incentive-based benefits or compensation maintained for and
provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) equity-based benefits or compensation that in the aggregate are no less
favorable than the equity-based benefits or compensation in the aggregate
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries but
adjusted to take into account the extent to which, if any, the base salary and
incentive-based compensation or benefits maintained for and provided to the
Company Employees pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) are more favorable than
those maintained for and provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its subsidiaries; provided, however, subject to the foregoing, that nothing
herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan or
interfere with the Surviving Corporation's right or obligation to make such
changes as are necessary to conform with applicable law. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall restrict the ability of Parent and its affiliates to
terminate the employment of any Company Employee for any reason at any time
after the effective date of his or her employment with Parent and its
affiliates.

                  (c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans) under any employee
compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of
and after the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation for the

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

Company Employees' service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their
predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Parent or its
subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and
amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and
will cause its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (x) each
existing employment, change in control, severance and termination plan, policy
or agreement of or between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any
officer, director or employee of that company, equity-based plans, programs or
agreements, bonus plans or programs, and (y) all obligations pursuant to
outstanding restoration plans, equity-based plans, programs or agreements, bonus
plans or programs, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its subsidiaries
and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements in
effect as of the Effective Time, in each case to the extent legally binding on
the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance.

                  (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee
may have under any Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer or director of the Company
and its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements
(collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions taken by them in their capacity as
officers or directors prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)
or taken by them at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified
Party of a request therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is
not entitled to indemnification.

                  (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation and By-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

                                      -50-
<PAGE>

                  (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the
Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions which are not materially less advantageous to
any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that during this period, Parent
shall not be required to maintain any coverage in excess of the amount that can
be obtained for the remainder of the period for an annual premium of 200% of the
current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage. Parent
agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporation's to
honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements entered into by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

                  (e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

                  (f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7.

                  SECTION 6.8 Further Actions. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, in the case of the Company, notices required under existing consent
decrees with the FTC (as defined below)). In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and a merger notification
pursuant to the ECMR with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or the ECMR.

<PAGE>

                  (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
Section 6.8(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, ECMR or any other
Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of the status of
matters related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
furnishing the other with any written notices or other communications received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the
European Commission or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity and of any
notices or other communications received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person,
and to the extent permitted by the FTC, DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences in accordance with
Antitrust Law. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the ECMR, Foreign Antitrust Laws, and all other
federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

                  (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in Sections 6.8(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or
if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ
or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, in
order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved,
could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting its
business in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits or agreeing to
sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a manner
which would resolve such objections or suits or permitting the sale, holding
separate or other disposition of, any of its assets or the assets of its
subsidiaries or the conducting of its business in a manner which would resolve
such objections or suits.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required by this Section

separate or otherwise disposing of assets or conducting its business in a
specified manner) unless (x) the taking of the action is conditioned on
consummation of the Merger and (y) the action would not result in, or would not
reasonably be expected to result in, the imposition of Burdensome Conditions.
"Burdensome Conditions" means any action proposed to be taken in accordance with
this Section 6.8 that, individually or in the aggregate with any other actions
proposed to be taken in accordance with this Section 6.8, would result in, or

the avoidance of doubt, materiality for this purpose shall be measured without
giving effect to the consummation of the Merger). At the request of Parent, the
Company shall take actions, or agree to take actions or consent to the taking of
actions (including with respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise
disposing of assets or conducting its business in a specified manner) as Parent
shall determine to be necessary or appropriate in order to obtain the consents,
approvals, declarations and authorizations of any Governmental Entity required
to be obtained in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be required by this
Section 6.8 to take any action, agree to take any action or consent to the
taking of any action (including with respect to selling, holding separate or
otherwise disposing of assets or conducting its business in a specified manner)
unless the taking of the action is conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.
The Company shall not take any action, agree to take any action or consent to
the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.8 (including with respect to
selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of assets or conducting its
business in a specified manner) without the prior written consent of Parent
(this consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

                  (e) Subject to the obligations under Sections 6.8(c) and (d),
in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private
party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to defend, at its own cost and expense, any action or actions, whether
judicial or administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.8 shall limit a party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) so long as such party has up
to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 6.8.

withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by
law or the rules or regulations of any applicable securities exchange or
regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or
submits,

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final
discretion of the disclosing party.

                  SECTION 6.10 Takeover Statutes. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the parties' respective fiduciary duties under applicable law, if
any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and their
respective Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, grant any
approvals and take any actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on

this suit, together with interest on the amount due from each date for payment
until the date of the payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on
