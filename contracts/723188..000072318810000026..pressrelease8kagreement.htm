AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
October 22, 2010, by and between COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("CBSI"), and THE WILBER CORPORATION, a New York corporation
("Wilber").

  

  

WHEREAS, CBSI is a bank holding company, the principal banking subsidiary of
which is Community Bank, N.A., a national banking association ("Community
Bank");

  

  

WHEREAS, Wilber is a bank holding company, the principal banking subsidiary of
which is Wilber National Bank, a national banking association ("Wilber Bank");

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of CBSI and Wilber have each
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective shareholders
for CBSI to acquire Wilber through the merger (the "Merger") of Wilber with
and into CBSI upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
and that the Merger presents an opportunity for their respective companies and
shareholders to achieve long-term strategic and financial benefits;

  

  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Merger, Wilber Bank, which shall
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBSI as a result of the Merger, shall
merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into Community Bank, with Community Bank
continuing as the surviving bank, pursuant to a plan of merger;

  

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the respective Boards of
Directors of CBSI and Wilber have each approved this Agreement and the Merger
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL") and the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York (the
"NYBCL") and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

  

  

WHEREAS, upon the consummation and effectiveness of the Merger, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Wilber ("Wilber Common Stock"), other than the Dissenting Shares (as defined
below), shall be converted into the right to receive shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of CBSI ("CBSI Common Stock") and/or cash, as
provided in Article II of this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to effectuate the Merger as a tax free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") with respect to the portion of
merger consideration consisting of shares of CBSI Common Stock, such that the
exchange of Wilber Common Stock for CBSI Common Stock and cash will not give
rise to a tax recognition event for the shareholders of Wilber with respect to
such portion of the merger consideration comprised of CBSI Common Stock;

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to CBSI's willingness to enter into this Agreement, all
executive officers and directors of Wilber are entering into a Voting
Agreement (collectively, the "Voting Agreements"), substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations, and agreements herein contained, and for other good and

(a) At the Effective Time, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Wilber shall be merged with and into CBSI, the separate
existence of Wilber shall cease and CBSI shall continue as the surviving

(b) As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the

2.2. Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Person, each share of Wilber Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
election of the holder thereof (in accordance with the election and allocation
procedures set forth in this Section 2.2) into either (i) shares of CBSI
Common Stock based upon the Exchange Ratio; (ii) cash, at the rate of $9.50
for each share of Wilber Common Stock; or (iii) a combination of such shares
of CBSI Common Stock and cash, as more fully set forth in Section 2.2(a)(iii)
(the shares of CBSI Common Stock issuable and the cash payable in connection
with the Merger sometimes being referred to as the "Merger Consideration".

  

  

(a) Election as to Outstanding Wilber Common Stock. The shareholders of Wilber
shall be given the following options in connection with the exchange of their
Wilber Common Stock pursuant to the Merger:

  

  

(i) At the option of each holder of Wilber Common Stock, all of such holder's
Wilber Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive such number
of shares of CBSI Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Wilber Common
Stock held by such holder times the Exchange Ratio (such election, the "All
Stock Election"), provided that:

  

  

(A) Fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be
paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(j); and

  

  

(B) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii), and (iii), in no event
shall, in the aggregate, more than eighty percent (80%) of Wilber Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time be converted
into and become shares of CBSI Common Stock; or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) At the option of each holder of Wilber Common Stock, all of such holder's
Wilber Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive cash (payable
by check) in an amount equal to the number of shares of Wilber Common Stock
held by such holder times $9.50 (such election, the "All Cash Election"),
provided that:

  

  

(A) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii), and (iii), in no event
shall, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent (20%) of Wilber Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time be either
Dissenting Shares or be converted into and become cash; or

  

  

(iii) At the option of each holder of Wilber Common Stock, eighty percent
(80%) of such holder's aggregate number of shares of Wilber Common Stock (the
"Stock Portion") shall be converted into the right to receive such number of
shares of CBSI Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Wilber Common
Stock in the Stock Portion times the Exchange Ratio, and twenty percent (20%)
of such holder's aggregate number of shares of Wilber Common Stock (the "Cash
Portion") shall be converted into the right to receive cash (payable by check)
in an amount equal to the number of shares of Wilber Common Stock in the Cash
Portion times $9.50 (such election, the "Mixed Election"), provided that:

  

  

(A) Fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be
paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(j); and

  

  

(B) After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), in no event

shall be converted into the right to receive CBSI Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.2(a)(i), cash as set forth in Section 2.2(a)(ii), or any combination
of CBSI Common Stock and cash as determined by CBSI; provided, however, that
no fractional shares shall be issued and cash will be paid in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(j). Such shares of Wilber Common Stock shall be
allocated by CBSI on a pro rata basis among non-electing holders based upon
the number of shares of Wilber Common Stock for which an election has not been
received by the Election Deadline in order to achieve the overall ratio of
eighty percent (80%) of Wilber Common Stock to be converted into CBSI Common
Stock and twenty percent (20%) of Wilber Common Stock to be converted into
cash after taking into account Dissenting Shares. Notice of such allocation
shall be provided promptly to each holder whose shares of Wilber Common Stock
are allocated pursuant to this Section 2.2(a)(iv).

conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

  

  

(c) Procedures for Election. An election form and other appropriate
transmittal materials in such form as the parties shall mutually agree (the
"Election Form") shall be mailed to shareholders of Wilber prior to the
Election Period. The "Election Period" shall be such period of time as the
parties shall mutually agree, within which Wilber shareholders may validly
elect the form of Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.2(a) (the
"Election") that they will receive, occurring between (i) the date of the
mailing by Wilber of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the special meeting of
shareholders of Wilber at which this Agreement and the Merger is presented for
approval, and (ii) the Closing Date. The "Election Deadline" shall be the
time, specified by CBSI after consultation with Wilber, at close of business
on the last day of the Election Period.

  

  

(d) Perfection of the Election. An Election shall be considered to have been
validly made by a holder of Wilber Common Stock only if (i) the Exchange Agent
shall have received an Election Form properly completed and executed by such
holder, accompanied by a certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Wilber Common Stock as to which such Election is being made, duly endorsed
in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of Wilber,
or containing an appropriate guaranty of delivery in the form customarily used
in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange
or a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or a commercial
bank or trust company in the United States and (ii) such Election Form and
such certificate(s) or such guaranty of delivery shall have been received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.

  

  

(e) Withdrawal of Shares. Any holder of Wilber Common Stock may at any time
prior to the Election Deadline revoke the holder's election and either (i)
submit a new Election Form in accordance with the procedures in Section
2.2(d), or (ii) withdraw the certificate(s) for Wilber Common Stock deposited
therewith by providing written notice that is received by the Exchange Agent
by 5:00 p.m., local time for the Exchange Agent, on the business day prior to
the Election Deadline. In the event of the termination of this Agreement, the
Exchange Agent shall return any certificates deposited by the holder of Wilber
Common Stock to such holder at the address and to the person set forth in the
Election Form.

  

  

(f) Reduction of Shares Deposited for Cash. If more than twenty percent (20%)
of the total number of shares of Wilber Common Stock issued and outstanding
constitute Dissenting Shares or, at the Election Deadline, have been deposited
for exchange with cash pursuant to the All Cash Election and/or the Mixed
Election and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 2.2(e), CBSI will cause to be
eliminated by the Exchange Agent, from the shares deposited pursuant to the
All Cash Election (subject to the limitations described in Section
2.2(f)(iv)), a sufficient number of such shares so that the total number of
shares remaining on deposit for exchange into cash pursuant to the All Cash
Election and the Mixed Election, when added to the number of Dissenting
Shares, does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the shares of Wilber Common
Stock issued and outstanding on the Election Deadline. The holders of Wilber
Common Stock who have made the Mixed Election shall not be required to have
more than eighty percent (80%) of their shares of Wilber Common Stock
converted into CBSI Common Stock. After giving effect to Section 2.2(a)(iv),
such elimination will be effected as follows:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Subject to the limitations described in Section 2.2(f)(iv), CBSI will
eliminate or cause to be eliminated from the shares deposited pursuant to the
All Cash Election, and will add or cause to be added to the shares deposited
for CBSI Common Stock pursuant to the All Stock Election, on a pro rata basis
in relation to the total number of shares deposited pursuant to the All Cash
Election minus the number of shares so deposited by the holders described in
Section 2.2(f)(iv), such number of whole shares of Wilber Common Stock on
deposit for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election as may be necessary so that
the total number of shares remaining on deposit for cash pursuant to the All
Cash Election or the Mixed Election, when added to the number of Dissenting
Shares, is equal, as nearly as practicable, to twenty percent (20%) of the
shares of Wilber Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (an illustration of the application of this subparagraph is
depicted on Exhibit B);

  

  

(ii) All shares of Wilber Common Stock that are eliminated pursuant to Section
2.2(f)(i) from the shares deposited for cash pursuant to All Cash Election
shall be converted into CBSI Common Stock as provided by Section 2.2(a)(i);

  

  

(iii) Notice of such allocation shall be provided by CBSI or the Exchange
Agent promptly after the Election Deadline to each holder whose shares of
Wilber Common Stock are eliminated from the shares on deposit for exchange
with cash pursuant to Section 2.2(f)(i); and

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of one hundred (100) or fewer
shares of Wilber Common Stock of record on the date of this Agreement who have
elected the All Cash Election shall not be required to have any of their
shares of Wilber Common Stock converted into CBSI Common Stock.

  

  

(g) Increase of Shares Deposited for Cash. If fewer than twenty percent (20%)
of the total number of shares of Wilber Common Stock issued and outstanding
have, at the Election Deadline, been deposited for cash pursuant to the All
Cash Election and/or the Mixed Election and not withdrawn pursuant to Section
2.2(e), CBSI will promptly add, or cause to be added by the Exchange Agent, to
such deposited shares, a sufficient number of shares of Wilber Common Stock
deposited for shares of CBSI Common Stock pursuant to the All Stock Election
so that the total number of shares of Wilber Common Stock on deposit for cash
pursuant to the All Cash Election and the Mixed Election immediately prior to
the Effective Time, when added to the number of Dissenting Shares, is not less
than twenty percent (20%) of the shares of Wilber Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The holders of Wilber
Common Stock who have elected to have their shares converted pursuant to the
Mixed Election shall not be required to have more than twenty percent (20%) of
their shares of Wilber Common Stock converted into cash. After giving effect
to Section 2.2(a)(iv), such addition will be effected as follows:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) CBSI will cause to be added to the shares deposited for cash pursuant to
the All Cash Election or the Mixed Election, and will eliminate or cause to be
eliminated from the shares deposited for CBSI Common Stock pursuant to the All
Stock Election, on a pro rata basis in relation to the total number of shares
of Wilber Common Stock deposited for shares of CBSI Common Stock pursuant to
the All Stock Election, such number of whole shares of Wilber Common Stock not
then on deposit for cash as may be necessary so that the number of shares
remaining on deposit for exchange with cash, when added to the number of
Dissenting Shares, is equal, as nearly as practicable, to twenty percent (20%)
of the shares of Wilber Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time;

  

  

(ii) All shares of Wilber Common Stock that are added pursuant to Section
2.2(g)(i) to the shares deposited for cash shall be converted into cash as

(iii) Notice of such allocation shall be provided by CBSI or the Exchange
Agent promptly after the Election Deadline to each holder whose shares of
Wilber Common Stock are added to the shares on deposit for cash pursuant to
Section 2.2(g)(i).

  

  

(h) CBSI Common Stock. Each share of CBSI Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain unchanged and shall constitute the
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(i) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. If, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of CBSI
Common Stock or Wilber Common Stock shall be increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number of shares, in each case by reason of
any stock split, recapitalization, or reclassification or other similar
change, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted proportionately.

  

  

(j) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing less than one
share of CBSI Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Wilber Common Stock. In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of such shares who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of CBSI Common Stock, upon surrender of
certificates representing shares of Wilber Common Stock for exchange, shall be
paid upon such surrender cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fraction multiplied by the CBSI Market Price.

  

  

2.3. Effect of Merger.

  

  

Upon the Effective Time of the Merger:

  

  

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of CBSI, each as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until amended in accordance with the DGCL.

  

  

(b) All respective assets, rights, franchises, and interest of Wilber and CBSI
in and to every type of property shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation
by virtue of the Merger without any deed or other transfer; and the Surviving
Corporation, without any order or other action on the part of any court or
otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of property, franchises and
interest, in the same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises
and interests were held and enjoyed by Wilber and CBSI immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all of the liabilities of
Wilber and CBSI and shall be bound by and subject to all of the obligations
and contracts of Wilber and CBSI, provided that nothing in this Agreement
shall render the Surviving Corporation liable for a liability or obligation of
Wilber, the satisfaction of which is subject to the prior approval or consent
of any regulatory authority, unless such regulatory approval or consent has
been obtained. All rights of creditors and obligees and all liens on property
of Wilber and CBSI shall be preserved and unimpaired.

  

  

(d) The directors and officers of CBSI immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation, with the addition of the new directors contemplated by Section
5.11(c).

  

  

2.4. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the shares of Wilber Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time and that are held by a shareholder who has properly
exercised his or her appraisal rights (such shares being collectively referred
to herein as "Dissenting Shares") under the NYBCL shall be canceled as of the
Effective Time and shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.2 unless and until the holder shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such
holder's right to dissent from the Merger under the NYBCL and to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the NYBCL. If any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or effectively withdrawn
or lost such holder's right to dissent from the Merger, each of such holder's
shares of Wilber Common Stock shall thereupon no longer be deemed Dissenting
Shares and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2.

  

  

2.5. Procedure to Exchange Shares.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, CBSI shall cause to be
deposited with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another financial
institution experienced in serving as an exchange agent for a public company
merger (the "Exchange Agent"), for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of CBSI Common
Stock and cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into which
the outstanding shares of Wilber Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to
Section 2.2 of this Agreement. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, CBSI shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to all holders of record of
Wilber Common Stock, excluding any holders of Dissenting Shares, letters of
transmittal specifying the procedures for delivery of such holders'
certificates formerly representing Wilber Common Stock to the Exchange Agent
in exchange for new certificates of CBSI Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issuable pursuant to this Article II. As soon as
practicable, after surrender to the Exchange Agent of the certificates of
Wilber Common Stock in accordance with the instructions of the letter of
transmittal, the Exchange Agent shall distribute to the former holders of
shares of Wilber Common Stock a certificate representing that number of shares
of CBSI Common Stock, and/or a check for cash payable in the Merger (including
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any), that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Agreement. In no event shall the holder of any such
surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest on any stock or cash
to be received in the Merger. If any certificate surrendered for exchange is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the surrendered certificate is
issued, the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such exchange
shall affix any required stock transfer tax stamps to the certificate or
provide funds for their purchase or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to CBSI Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate formerly representing shares of Wilber Common Stock until such
holder shall surrender such certificate in accordance with this Section. After
the surrender of a certificate in accordance with this Section, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore have become
payable with respect to shares of CBSI Common Stock.

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Wilber shall be closed
and no transfer of Wilber Common Stock shall thereafter be made or recognized.
If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section.

  

  

(d) In the event any certificate shall have been lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated and, if required
by CBSI, the making of an indemnity agreement in a form reasonably requested
by CBSI and/or the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as CBSI may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Neither CBSI nor Wilber shall be liable to any holder of shares of Wilber
Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. After
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, CBSI shall be entitled to
instruct the Exchange Agent to release to CBSI all of the shares of CBSI
Common Stock and cash then remaining undistributed to former shareholders of
Wilber. Thereafter, CBSI shall deliver certificates representing an
appropriate number of shares of CBSI Common Stock and/or a check for cash in
lieu of fractional shares, if any, from time to time, as certificates
representing Wilber Common Stock, the accompanying letter of transmittal and
other related documents are presented to the Exchange Agent or CBSI, until at
such time as such shares and cash are delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.6. Tax Treatment. The parties hereto intend that the Merger qualify as a tax
free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

2.7. Modification of Structure. Upon the mutual written consent of Wilber and
CBSI (which consent on the part of Wilber shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), or at the request of any regulatory authority, CBSI shall have
the right to modify the structure of any of the Transactions, provided that
(a) there are no adverse tax consequences to the stockholders of Wilber as a
result of such modification, (b) the Merger Consideration is not reduced or
changed as a result of such modification, and (c) consummation of the
Transactions is not likely to be impaired or delayed as a result of such
modification.

States and foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.4. Authorized and Effective Agreement.

  

  

(a) Wilber has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each such Transaction Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action in respect thereof on the part of Wilber, except
for the affirmative vote of a two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of
Wilber Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which is the only shareholder
vote required to approve the Merger pursuant to Wilber's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. The Board of Directors of Wilber has approved and
adopted this Agreement and the Merger, and directed that this Agreement be
submitted to Wilber's shareholders for approval at a special meeting to be
held as soon as practicable. The Board of Directors of Wilber has unanimously
recommended that the shareholders of Wilber approve this Agreement and the
Merger. In connection with its approval of this Agreement and the Merger, the
Board of Directors of Wilber has received a written fairness opinion dated on
or about the date hereof from Austin Associates LLC to the effect that the
Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
shareholders of Wilber.

  

  

(b) This Agreement and each Transaction Document to which Wilber is a party
have been duly executed and delivered by Wilber and, assuming the accuracy of
the representation contained in Section 4.3(b) hereof, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Wilber, enforceable
against Wilber in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability
may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles.

  

  

(c) Neither the execution and delivery by Wilber of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which it is a party, nor consummation of the
Transactions, nor compliance by Wilber with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof shall (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Wilber, (ii) assuming the consents
and approvals contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof and the consents and
approvals which are Previously Disclosed are duly obtained, constitute or
result in a breach of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a
default under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration with respect to, or result in the creation of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any property or asset of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or (iii) assuming the consents and approvals contemplated by Section
5.3 hereof and the consents and approvals which are Previously Disclosed are
duly obtained, conflict with or violate any law, order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective assets; except, in case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) above, for any such breach, default, right, lien, charge, encumbrances,
violation or conflict which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber.

  

  

(d) Other than as contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof, no consent, approval or
authorization of, or declaration, notice, filing or registration with, any
governmental or regulatory authority, or any other Person, is required to be
made or obtained by Wilber on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the consummation of the
Transactions. As of the date hereof, Wilber is not aware of any reason that
the condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) of this Agreement would not be
satisfied.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.5. Regulatory Filings. Each of Wilber and its Subsidiaries has filed all
reports required by statute or regulation to be filed with any federal or
state bank regulatory agency, except where the failure to so file would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber, and such reports were prepared in
accordance with the applicable statutes, regulations and instructions in
existence as of the date of filing of such reports in all material respects.

  

  

3.6. SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Books and Records; Minute Books.
Wilber has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with
the SEC since January 1, 2007. The SEC Documents (i) were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Wilber Financial
Statements filed by Wilber in its SEC Documents prior to the date of this
Agreement fairly present, and the Wilber Financial Statements filed by Wilber
in its SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement will fairly present, the
consolidated financial position of Wilber as of the dates indicated and the
consolidated income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows of Wilber
and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods then ended and each such
financial statement has been or will be, as the case may be, prepared in
conformity with GAAP applied to financial institutions applied on a consistent
basis, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not
expected to be material in amount, and may not contain certain related notes
as may be permitted by the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC. The books
and records of Wilber and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect in all
material respects the transactions to which it is a party or by which its
properties are subject or bound. Such books and records have been properly
kept and maintained and are in compliance with all applicable legal and
accounting requirements in all material respects. The minute books of Wilber
and each of its Subsidiaries contain records which are accurate in all
material respects of all corporate actions of its shareholders and Board of
Directors (including committees of its Board of Directors).

  

  

3.7. Material Adverse Change. Wilber has not, on a consolidated basis,
suffered any change in its financial condition, results of operations or
business since December 31, 2009, which, individually or in the aggregate with
any other such changes, would constitute a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Wilber. For purposes of this Section, a Material Adverse Effect
shall be deemed to have occurred if Wilber's Delinquent Loans as of any month
end prior to the Closing Date, equals or exceeds $32.16 million. "Delinquent
Loans" shall mean (i) all Loans with principal and/or interest that are 30-89
days past due, (ii) all Loans with principal and/or interest that are at least
90 days past due and still accruing, (iii) all Loans with principal and/or
interest that are nonaccruing, (iv) Loans which constitute troubled debt
restructurings under GAAP or applicable law, (v) OREO and (vi) net charge-offs
from August 31, 2010 through the Closing Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.8. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Wilber nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to
Wilber on a consolidated basis, or that, when combined with all similar
liabilities, would be material to Wilber on a consolidated basis, except as
disclosed in the Wilber Financial Statements contained in an SEC Document
filed prior to the date hereof and except for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2010.

3.11. Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets.

  

  

(a) Except as Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing, each loan, line of
credit, extension of credit, credit enhancement, guarantee, loan
participation, lease, promissory note, borrowing arrangement and loan
commitment ("Loan") on the books and records of Wilber and its Subsidiaries

course of business, (ii) was made and has been serviced in all material
respects in accordance with their customary lending standards in the ordinary

and sufficient documentation, (iv) to the Knowledge of Wilber, constitutes the

transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditor's rights or by general equity principles, and (v) Wilber has not
received written notice from the obligor asserting any defense, set-off or

fair market value less cost to sell.

  

  

(c) Except as Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing, all reserves or other
allowances for Loan losses reflected in Wilber's Financial Statements complied
with all applicable laws and are adequate under GAAP. Wilber has not been
notified by any state or federal bank regulatory agency that its reserves are

reserves reflected in the Wilber's Financial Statements, and in accounting for
delinquent and classified assets generally fail to comply with applicable
accounting or regulatory requirements, or that bank regulators or Wilber's
independent auditor believes such reserves to be inadequate or inconsistent
with the historical loss experience of Wilber. Wilber's reserves and

state and federal bank regulatory agencies, are sufficient at the date of this

with Wilber's past practices.

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

  

  

(e) Each mortgage held by Wilber and each Wilber Subsidiary creates a valid
and enforceable lien on the real property described therein having the
priority indicated by the terms of such mortgage, subject only to such
exceptions as are described in attorneys' opinions regarding title or in title
insurance policies in the mortgage files relating to the Loans secured thereby
or are not material as to the collectability of such Loans. Wilber and each
Wilber Subsidiary have properly perfected or caused to be properly perfected
all security interests, liens and other interests in collateral securing any
Loans made by it. Except as Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing, Wilber
and each Wilber Subsidiary has full recourse to the borrowers and guarantors
of all Loans held by them, and neither Wilber nor any Wilber Subsidiary has
taken action which would result in a waiver or negation of any rights or
remedies available against the borrower or guarantor on any Loan.

  

  

(f) Except as Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing, each outstanding Loan
participation sold by Wilber or any Wilber Subsidiary was sold with the risk
of non-payment of all or any portion of that underlying loan to be shared by
each participant proportionately to the share of such Loan represented by such
participation without any recourse of such other lender or participant to
Wilber or any Wilber Subsidiary for payment or repurchase of the amount of
such Loan represented by the participation or liability under any yield
maintenance or similar obligation.

developments in the condition of the borrower or other events or circumstances

party which has notified Wilber or a Wilber Subsidiary during the past 12
months of, or has asserted against Wilber, orally or in writing, any "lender
liability" or similar claim, (iv) all Loans, (A) that are contractually past
due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or interest, (B) that are
on non-accrual status, (C) that as of the date of this Agreement are

"Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss", "Classified", "Criticized", "Watch List" or
words of similar import, together with the principal amount of and accrued and
unpaid interest on each such loan and the identity of the obligor thereunder,
(D) where, during the past three years, the interest rate terms have been
reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the
agreement under which the Loan was originally created due to concerns
regarding the borrower's ability to pay in accordance with such initial terms,
or (E) where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection therewith and
(v) all assets classified by Wilber as OREO and all other assets currently
held that were acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure.

  

  

3.12. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Wilber and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed federal income tax
returns for each year through December 31, 2009 and have timely filed, or
caused to be filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to
Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries. All Taxes due by or on behalf of Wilber or
any of its Subsidiaries have been paid or adequate reserves have been
established on the Wilber Financial Statements for the payment of such Taxes.
Neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries will have any liability for any
such Taxes in excess of the amounts so paid or reserves or accruals so
established, except where such liability would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber.

  

  

(b) All Tax Returns filed by Wilber and each of its Subsidiaries are complete
and accurate in all material respects. Neither Wilber nor any of its
Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of any material Tax, and none of
them has requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns
which have not since been filed. No material audit, examination, deficiency,
adjustment, refund claim or litigation with respect to Tax Returns, paid
Taxes, unpaid Taxes or Tax attributes of Wilber has been proposed, asserted or
assessed (tentatively or otherwise). There are currently no agreements in
effect with respect to Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries to extend the period
of limitations for the assessment or collection of any Tax.

  

  

(c) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Transactions nor the
termination of the employment of any employees of Wilber prior to or following
consummation of the Transactions will result in Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any successor thereof) making or being required to make any
"excess parachute payment" as that term is defined in Section 280G of the
Code.

affecting Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 7121 of the
Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of state,

Effective Time.

  

  

3.13. Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Wilber has Previously Disclosed to CBSI in writing a true and complete
list of each Wilber Plan. For purposes of this Section 3.13, the term "Wilber
Plan" means each bonus, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
purchase, stock option, severance pay, medical, life or other insurance,
profit-sharing, or pension plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and each
other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by Wilber or by
any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that together with Wilber
would be deemed a "single employer" under Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate") for the benefit of any employee or director or former employee or
former director of Wilber or any ERISA Affiliate of Wilber.

  

  

(b) With respect to each of the Wilber Plans, Wilber has made available to
CBSI true and complete copies of each of the following documents: (i) the
Wilber Plan and related documents (including all amendments thereto); (ii) the
most recent annual reports, financial statements, and actuarial reports, if
any; (iii) the most recent summary plan description, together with each
summary of material modifications, required under ERISA with respect to such
Wilber Plan and all material communications relating to each such Wilber Plan;
and (iv) the most recent determination letter received from the IRS with
respect to each Wilber Plan that is intended to be qualified under the Code
and all material communications to or from the IRS or any other governmental
or regulatory agency or authority relating to each Wilber Plan.

  

  

(c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Wilber or any
ERISA Affiliate of Wilber that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to Wilber or any ERISA
Affiliate of Wilber of incurring a liability under such Title, other than
liability for premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
which premiums have been or will be paid when due.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Neither Wilber nor, to the Knowledge of Wilber, any ERISA Affiliate of
Wilber, nor any of the Wilber Plans, nor, to the Knowledge of Wilber, any
trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged
in a prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) in connection with which Wilber or any ERISA
Affiliate of Wilber could reasonably be expected to, either directly or
indirectly, incur any material liability or material cost.

  

  

(e) Full payment has been made, or will be made in accordance with Section
404(a)(6) of the Code, of all amounts that Wilber or any ERISA Affiliate of
Wilber is required to pay under Section 412 of the Code or under the terms of
the Wilber Plans.

  

  

(f) The fair market value of the assets held under each Wilber Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of
all accrued benefits under each such Wilber Plan. No reportable event under
Section 4043 of ERISA has occurred with respect to any Wilber Plan other than
any reportable event occurring by reason of the Transactions or a reportable
event for which the requirement of notice to the PBGC has been waived.

  

  

(g) None of the Wilber Plans is a "multiemployer pension plan," as such term
is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement," as such term is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, or a single
employer plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom
are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

  

  

(h) A favorable determination letter has been issued by the IRS with respect
to each of the Wilber Plans that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code to the effect that such plan is so
qualified and, to the Knowledge of Wilber, no condition exists that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Wilber Plan. Each of the
Wilber Plans that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125 or
501(c)(9) of the Code satisfies such requirements in all material respects.
Each of the Wilber Plans has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable laws, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code.

  

  

(i) There are no actions, suits or claims pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Wilber, threatened or anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits)
against any Wilber Plan, the assets of any Wilber Plan or against Wilber or
any ERISA Affiliate of Wilber with respect to any Wilber Plan. There is no
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental body,
commission, agency or arbitrator outstanding against or in favor of any Wilber
Plan or any fiduciary thereof, other than rules of general applicability.
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Wilber, threatened audits,
examinations or investigations by any governmental body, commission or agency
involving any Wilber Plan.

  

  

(j) Except as Previously Disclosed, the consummation of the Transactions will
not result in, and is not a precondition to, (i) any current or former
employee or director of Wilber or any ERISA Affiliate of Wilber becoming
entitled to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any similar payment,
(ii) any acceleration in the time of payment or vesting, or increase in the
amount, of any compensation due to any such current or former employee or
director, or (iii) any renewal or extension of the term of any agreement
regarding compensation for any such current or former employee or director.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.14. Material Contracts.

  

  

(a) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to, and is bound by, (i) any material contract, as defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, which has not been filed
as an exhibit to Wilber's SEC Documents or any other material agreement or
similar arrangement (any contract or commitment which could reasonably be
expected to involve expenditures or receipt by Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000 in the aggregate shall be deemed material
for these purposes) whether or not made in the ordinary course of business
(other than loans or loan commitments and funding transactions in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice of Wilber Bank) or any
agreement restricting the nature or geographic scope of its business
activities in any material respect, (ii) any agreement, indenture or other
instrument relating to the borrowing of money by Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries or the guarantee by Wilber of any of its Subsidiaries of any such
obligation, other than instruments relating to transactions entered into in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) any
agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to the employment of a Person
who is or was a director or officer or to the employment, election, retention
in office or severance of any present or former director or officer, (iv) any
agreement, arrangement or commitment that would obligate Wilber or any Wilber
Subsidiary to pay any stay or retention bonus or change-in-control, severance
or termination payment to any current or former director or officer as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions or the separation from service
of any director or officer following consummation of the Transactions, or (v)
any contract, agreement or understanding with a labor union, in each case
whether written or oral.

  

  

(b) Neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under any
material agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other
instrument whether entered into in the ordinary course of business or
otherwise and whether written or oral, and there has not occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or giving of notice or both, would constitute
such a default, except for such defaults which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber.

  

  

3.15. Legal Proceedings. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no actions,
suits or proceedings instituted, pending or, to the Knowledge of Wilber,
threatened against Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries or against any asset,
interest or right of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries that, if decided
against Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries, would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber. There are no actual or,
to the Knowledge of Wilber, threatened actions, suits or proceedings which
present a claim to restrain or prohibit the Transactions or to impose any
material liability or restrictions in connection therewith. There are no
actions, suits or proceedings instituted, pending or, to the Knowledge of
Wilber, threatened against any present or former director or officer of Wilber
or any of its Subsidiaries, that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
a claim for indemnification.

  

  

3.16. Compliance with Laws. Except as Previously Disclosed, Wilber and each of
its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes
and regulations applicable to the conduct of its business, and since January
1, 2007 neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notification
from any agency or department of federal, state or local government (i)
asserting a violation of any such statute or regulation, (ii) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise, permit or government authorization or (iii) in
any way restricting or limiting its operations. Neither Wilber nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any regulatory or supervisory cease and desist
order, agreement, directive, memorandum of understanding or commitment which
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Wilber, or has received any communication contemplating any of the foregoing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.17. Labor Matters. With respect to their employees, neither Wilber nor its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining or other similar
agreement with any labor organization, group or association or has engaged in
any unfair labor practice. Since January 1, 2009, neither Wilber nor its
Subsidiaries has experienced any attempt by organized labor or its
representatives to make Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries conform to demands
of organized labor relating to their employees or to enter into a binding
agreement with organized labor that would cover the employees of Wilber or any
of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Wilber, there is no unfair labor
practice charge or other complaint by any employee or former employee of
Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries against any of them pending before any
court, arbitrator or governmental agency arising out of Wilber's or such
Subsidiary's activities or such employee's employment with Wilber or such
Subsidiary. There is no strike, work stoppage or labor disturbance pending or,
to the Knowledge of Wilber, threatened against Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries, and neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced
any such strike, stoppage or disturbance since January 1, 2009.

  

  

3.18. Brokers and Finders. Neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
of their respective officers, directors or employees, has engaged any broker,
finder or financial advisor or become obligated to or incurred any liability
for any fees or commissions in connection with the Transactions, except for
the firms of Sandler O'Neil and Partners, L.P. and Austin Associates LLC to
provide financial advice with respect to the transaction provided for in this
Agreement. Wilber has heretofore furnished to CBSI a complete and correct copy
of all agreements between Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries and Sandler O'Neil
and Partners, L.P. and Austin Associates LLC, pursuant to which such firms would
be entitled to any payment relating to the Transactions.

  

  

3.19. Insurance. Each of Wilber and its Subsidiaries currently maintains
insurance in amounts reasonably adequate for their operations. Neither Wilber
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a material premium
increase over current rates or cancellation with respect to any of their
insurance policies or bonds, and within the last three years, neither Wilber
nor any of its Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance coverage sought or
applied for, and neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries has any reason to
believe that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the
same shall expire, upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently
in effect. Wilber has Previously Disclosed a list of all outstanding claims as
of the date hereof by Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries under any insurance
policy. The deposits of Wilber Bank are insured by the FDIC in accordance with
the FDIA, and Wilber Bank has paid all assessments and filed all reports
required by the FDIA.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.20. Environmental Liability. Except as Previously Disclosed:

  

  

(a) During the period that Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries has owned, leased
or operated any properties or facilities, neither it nor any other Person has
disposed, released, or participated in or authorized the release or threatened
release of Hazardous Materials on, from or under such properties or
facilities. There is not now nor, to the Knowledge of Wilber, has there ever
been any presence, disposal, release or threatened release of Hazardous
Materials on, from or under any of such properties or facilities, which may
have occurred prior to Wilber having taken possession of any of such
properties or facilities. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"disposal," "release," and "threatened release" shall have the definitions
assigned thereto by the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, 42 U. S.C. Sec. 9601 et seq., as amended ("CERCLA").

  

  

(b) The operations of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries, and properties that
Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries owns or leases, are in compliance with
Environmental Law. During the time that Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries has
owned or leased its properties and facilities, neither Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Wilber, any third party has used,
generated, manufactured or stored on, under or about such properties or
facilities or transported or arranged for disposal to or from such properties
or facilities, any Hazardous Materials in violation of applicable
Environmental Law.

  

  

(c) During the time that Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries has owned or leased
its properties and facilities, there has been no litigation brought or, to the
Knowledge Wilber, threatened against Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries by, or
any settlement reached by Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries with, any Person
alleging the presence, disposal, release or threatened release of any
Hazardous Materials, on from or under any of such properties or facilities.

  

  

(d) There are no facts, circumstances or conditions relating to the properties
and facilities owned or leased by Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries known to
Wilber which are reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under any
Environmental Law or to any material Environmental Costs and Liabilities.

  

  

3.21. Administration of Trust Accounts. Wilber and each of its Subsidiaries
have properly administered all common trust funds and collective investment
funds and all accounts for which each of them acts as a fiduciary or agent,
including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment
advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law, except where
the failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Wilber. Neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees acting on behalf
of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with
respect to any such common trust fund or collective investment fund or
fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings for each such common trust
fund or collective investment fund or fiduciary or agency account are true and
correct in all material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such
common trust fund or collective investment fund or fiduciary or agency
account, except for such breaches and failures to be true, correct and
accurate which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Wilber.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.22. Intellectual Property. Each of Wilber and its Subsidiaries owns the
entire right, title and interest in and to, or has valid licenses with respect
to, all of the Intellectual Property necessary in all material respects to
conduct their respective businesses and operations as presently conducted,
except where the failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber. The ownership, licensing or use of
Intellectual Property by Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries does not conflict
with, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property
rights of any other Person. None of such Intellectual Property is subject to
any outstanding order, decree, judgment, stipulation, settlement, lien,
charge, encumbrance or attachment, which order, decree, judgment, stipulation,
settlement, lien, charge, encumbrance or attachment would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Wilber. Except as Previously
Disclosed, upon consummation of the Transactions, CBSI will be entitled to
continue to use all such Intellectual Property without the payment of any
fees, licenses or other payments.

  

  

3.23. Certain Information. When the Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto shall become effective, and at all times
subsequent to such effectiveness up to and including the time of the Wilber
Shareholders' Meeting to vote upon the approval of this Agreement, such
Registration Statement and all amendments or supplements thereto, with respect
to all information set forth or incorporated by reference therein furnished by
Wilber relating to Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) shall comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Laws, and
(ii) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. All information concerning Wilber and its
directors, officers, and shareholders included (or submitted for inclusion) in
any application and furnished by it pursuant to Sections 5.2 or 5.3 of this
Agreement shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects.

  

  

3.24. Risk Management Instruments. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar risk
management arrangements to which Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
whether entered into for Wilber's own account, or for the account of one or
more of such Subsidiaries or their customers, were entered into (i) in
accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies and (ii) with parties reasonably believed
to be financially responsible; and each of them constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of Wilber or such Subsidiary, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general equity principles), and neither Wilber
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor to Wilber's Knowledge, any other party
thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or
arrangement. Wilber has previously made available to CBSI all of such
agreements and arrangements that are in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

  

  

3.25. Tax Treatment. As of the date of this Agreement, Wilber knows of no
reason relating to it which would reasonably cause it to believe that the
Merger will not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

3.26. Interested Party Transactions. Except as Previously Disclosed, no
Related Party (as defined below) has been directly or indirectly a party to
any contract or other arrangement (whether written or oral) with Wilber or any
of its Subsidiaries pertaining to deposits, loans, services (other than as an
employee), products, goods or supplies, rental of real or personal property,
or otherwise requiring payments, provided from or to Wilber in an amount in
excess of $50,000 in the aggregate (collectively, the "Interested Party
Transactions"). For purposes hereof, the term "Related Party" shall mean a
5%-or-greater shareholder of Wilber, a director or officer of Wilber or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any member of such person's family or any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, other business entity or trust in
which such person or any member of such person's family has greater than a ten
percent (10%) interest, or of which such person or any member of such person's
family is an officer, director, partner, member or trustee. Each Interested
Party Transaction that is an arrangement to make a loan to the applicable
Related Party, or is a deposit or other investment by the applicable Related
Party, was an arms'-length transaction approved pursuant to the normal
underwriting standards, and substantially upon the normal commercial terms and
conditions, that are applicable for comparable transactions to Wilber's
unaffiliated customers.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.27. Takeover Statutes Not Applicable; No Rights Agreement. The Board of
Directors of Wilber has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained
in Section 912 of the NYBCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined
therein) will not apply to the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which Wilber is a party, or to the consummation of the
Transactions. Wilber has no shareholder rights agreement or plan or other
similar plan, agreement or arrangement.

  

  

3.28. Investment Securities. Except for pledges to secure public and trust
deposits, Federal Reserve borrowings, repurchase agreements and reverse
repurchase agreements entered into in arms'-length transactions pursuant to
normal commercial terms and conditions and other pledges required by law, none
of the investments reflected in the Wilber Financial Statements, and none of
the material investments made by Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries since
December 31, 2009, is subject to any restriction (contractual, statutory or
otherwise) that would materially impair the ability of the entity holding such
investment freely to dispose of such investment at any time.

  

  

3.29. Capitalization. Wilber and Wilber Bank are "well capitalized" as such
term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Board and the FDIC.

  

  

3.30. CRA, Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Information Security. Neither
Wilber nor Wilber Bank is aware of, has been advised of, or has reason to
believe that any facts or circumstances exist which would cause Wilber Bank:
(i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect
with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the "CRA") and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA
purposes by federal or state bank regulators of lower than "satisfactory," or
(ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the
federal Bank Secrecy Act, as amended and its implementing regulations (31 CFR
part 103), the USA Patriot Act of 2001, Public Law 107-56 (the "USA Patriot
Act") and the regulations promulgated thereunder, any order issued with
respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign
Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or
regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any
material respect with the privacy of customer information requirements
contained in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations
promulgated thereunder as well as the provisions of the Information Security
Program adopted by OFSLA pursuant to 12 CFR Part 364. The Board of Directors
of Wilber Bank has adopted, and Wilber Bank has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that meets the requirements in all material respects of
Section 352 of the USA Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.31. Agreements with and Examination by Banking Authorities. Except as
Previously Disclosed, neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any commitment, letter (other than letters addressed to regulated depository
institutions generally), written agreement, memorandum of understanding, order
to cease and desist with, is subject to any order or directive specifically
naming or referring to Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries by, has been required
to adopt any board resolution by, any federal or state governmental entity
charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or bank holding companies
or engaged in the insurance of bank deposits which is currently in effect, and
neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice from any such
federal or state governmental entity that any such Person may be required to
enter into, or otherwise be subject to, any such commitment, letter, written
agreement, memorandum of understanding or cease or desist order. Except as
Previously Disclosed, neither Wilber nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
informed by any bank regulator that it is contemplating issuing, requesting or
amending any such order, directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding,
commitment letter or similar submission.

  

  

3.32. Ownership of CBSI Common Stock. Neither Wilber nor, to the Knowledge of
Wilber, any of its affiliates or associates beneficially owns in the aggregate
three percent (3%) or more of the outstanding shares of CBSI Common Stock or,
to the Knowledge of Wilber, has acquired shares of CBSI Common Stock which
were at any time in the past two years beneficially owned by an "Interested
Shareholder" (as defined in CBSI's certificate of incorporation) if such
acquisition occurred other than pursuant to a public offering within the
meaning of the Securities Act, in each case such that Wilber would be deemed
an "Interested Shareholder" under CBSI's certificate of incorporation.

  

  

3.33. Disclosure. None of the representations and warranties of Wilber
contained in this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party, or any of the written information or documents furnished by Wilber to
CBSI in connection therewith, taken as a whole, contains or will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated or necessary to make any such information or document,
in light of the circumstances, not misleading.

note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii)
assuming the consents and approvals contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof and the
consents and approvals which are Previously Disclosed are duly obtained,
conflict with or violate any law, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute,
rule or regulation applicable to CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective assets; except, in case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any
such breach, default, right, lien, charge, encumbrances, violation or conflict
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Other than as contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof, no consent, approval or
authorization of, or declaration, notice, filing or registration with, any
governmental or regulatory authority, or any other Person, is required to be
made or obtained by CBSI on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the consummation of the
Transactions. As of the date hereof, CBSI is not aware of any reason that the
condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) of this Agreement would not be
satisfied.

  

  

4.4. Regulatory Filings. Each of CBSI and its Subsidiaries has filed all
reports required by statute or regulation to be filed with any federal or
state bank regulatory agency, except where the failure to so file would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI, and such reports were prepared in
accordance with the applicable statutes, regulations and instructions in
existence as of the date of filing of such reports in all material respects.

  

  

4.5. SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Books and Records; Minute Books.
CBSI has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed with the
SEC since January 1, 2007. The SEC Documents (i) were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The CBSI Financial
Statements filed by CBSI in its SEC Documents prior to the date of this
Agreement fairly present, and the CBSI Financial Statements filed by CBSI in
its SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement will fairly present, the
consolidated financial position of CBSI as of the dates indicated and the
consolidated income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows of CBSI
and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods then ended and each such
financial statement has been or will be, as the case may be, prepared in
conformity with GAAP applied to financial institutions applied on a consistent
basis, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not
expected to be material in amount, and may not contain certain related notes
as may be permitted by the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC. The books
and records of CBSI and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect in all
material respects the transactions to which it is a party or by which its
properties are subject or bound. Such books and records have been properly
kept and maintained and are in compliance with all applicable legal and
accounting requirements in all material respects.

  

  

4.6. Material Adverse Change. CBSI has not, on a consolidated basis, suffered
any change in its financial condition, results of operations or business since
December 31, 2009, which, individually or in the aggregate with any other such
changes, would constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.7. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither CBSI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to
CBSI on a consolidated basis, or that, when combined with all similar
liabilities, would be material to CBSI on a consolidated basis, except as
disclosed in the CBSI Financial Statements contained in an SEC Document filed
prior to the date hereof and except for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2010.

  

  

4.8. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) CBSI and each CBSI Subsidiary have timely filed federal income tax returns
for each year through December 31, 2009 and have timely filed, or caused to be
filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to CBSI or any
of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to file timely such federal
income and other Tax Returns would not, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on CBSI. All Taxes due by or on behalf of CBSI or any of its
Subsidiaries have been paid or adequate reserves have been established on the
CBSI Financial Statements for the payment of such Taxes, except where any such
failure to pay or establish adequate reserves would not, in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. Neither CBSI nor any of its
Subsidiaries will have any material liability for any such Taxes in excess of
the amounts so paid or reserves or accruals so established except where such
liability would not have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI.

  

  

(b) All Tax Returns filed by CBSI and each of its Subsidiaries are complete
and accurate in all material respects. Neither CBSI nor any CBSI Subsidiary is
delinquent in the payment of any material Tax, and, except as Previously
Disclosed, none of them has requested any extension of time within which to
file any Tax Returns which have not since been filed. Except as Previously
Disclosed or as fully settled and paid or accrued on the CBSI Financial
Statements, no material audit examination, deficiency, adjustment, refund
claim or litigation with respect to Tax Returns, paid Taxes, unpaid Taxes or
Tax attributes of CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries has been proposed, asserted
or assessed (tentatively or otherwise).

  

  

(c) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries
is required to include in income any adjustment in any taxable period ending
after the date hereof pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code other than any
adjustment for which it already has made an accrual.

  

  

4.9. Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Each of the CBSI Plans complies with the requirements of applicable law,
including ERISA and the Code, except where the failure to so comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "CBSI Plan" means each bonus, incentive
compensation, severance pay, medical or other insurance program, retirement
plan, or other employee benefit plan program, agreement or arrangement
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate or
under which CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate has any liability or obligation. No
liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by CBSI or any ERISA
Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that
presents a material risk to CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such
liability. Full payment has been made, or will be made in accordance with
Section 404(a)(6) of the Code of all amounts that CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate
is required to pay under Section 412 of the Code or under the terms of the
CBSI Plans, and no accumulated funding deficiency (within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code) exists with respect to any CBSI Plan.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Neither CBSI nor, to the Knowledge of CBSI, any ERISA Affiliate of CBSI,
nor any of the CBSI Plans, nor, to the Knowledge of CBSI, any trust created
thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section
4975 of the Code) in connection with which CBSI or any ERISA Affiliate of CBSI
could reasonably be expected to, either directly or indirectly, incur any
material liability or material cost.

  

  

(c) A favorable determination letter has been issued by the IRS with respect
to each of the CBSI Plans that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code to the effect that such plan is so
qualified and, to the Knowledge of CBSI, no condition exists that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any such CBSI Plan. Each of the CBSI
Plans that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125 or 501(c)(9)
of the Code satisfies such requirements in all material respects.

  

  

4.10. Legal Proceedings. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no actions,
suits or proceedings instituted, pending or, to the Knowledge of CBSI,
threatened against CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries or against any asset,
interest or right of CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries that, if decided against
CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries, would, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI. There are no actual or, to the Knowledge of
CBSI, threatened actions, suits or proceedings which present a claim to
restrain or prohibit the Transactions or to impose any material liability or
restrictions in connection therewith.

  

  

4.11. Brokers and Finders. Neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
of their respective officers, directors or employees, has engaged any broker,
finder or financial advisor or become obligated to or incurred any liability
for any fees or commissions in connection with the Transactions, except for
the firm of Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC to provide financial advice with
respect to the transaction provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

4.12. Environmental Liability. Neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of any legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceeding, claim or action and, to the Knowledge of CBSI, there is no
governmental investigation of any nature pending, in each case that would
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition on CBSI or any of its
Subsidiaries of any liability arising under any local, state or federal
environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation,
CERCLA; there are no facts or circumstances which would reasonably be expected
to form the basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any such liability; and neither CBSI nor any
of its Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree or
memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any such liability.

  

  

4.13. Compliance with Laws. CBSI and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
in all material respects with all statutes and regulations applicable to the
conduct of its business, and since January 1, 2007 neither CBSI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notification from any agency or department of
federal, state or local government (i) asserting a violation of any such
statute or regulation, (ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise,
permit or government authorization or (iii) in any way restricting or limiting
its operations. Neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
regulatory or supervisory cease and desist order, agreement, directive,
memorandum of understanding or commitment which would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on CBSI, or has received any
communication contemplating any of the foregoing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.14. Certain Information. When the Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto shall become effective, and at all times
subsequent to such effectiveness up to and including the time of the Wilber
Shareholders' Meeting to vote upon the approval of this Agreement, such
Registration Statement and all amendments or supplements thereto, with respect
to all information set forth or incorporated by reference therein furnished by
CBSI relating to CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) shall comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Laws, and
(ii) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. All information concerning CBSI and its
directors, officers, and shareholders included (or submitted for inclusion) in
any application and furnished by it pursuant to Sections 5.2 or 5.3 of this
Agreement shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects.

  

  

4.15. Tax Treatment. As of the date of this Agreement, CBSI knows of no reason
relating to it which would reasonably cause it to believe that the Merger will
not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

4.16. Merger Consideration. CBSI will have, at the Effective Time, unissued
shares of Common Stock and shares of Common Stock held in its treasury that
are not reserved for any other purpose sufficient to issue the number of
shares of CBSI Common Stock contemplated by Article II, and a sufficient
amount of cash to pay the amount contemplated by Article II.

  

  

4.17. Properties. CBSI and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title
free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, defaults or equitable
interests to all of the properties and assets, real and personal, which are
material to the business of CBSI on a consolidated basis, and which are
reflected on the CBSI Financial Statements as of December 31, 2009 or acquired
after such date, except (i) liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, (ii)
pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred in the ordinary course of
banking business as reflected in the books and records of CBSI, (iii) such
imperfections of title, easements and encumbrances, if any, as are not
material in character, amount or extent and (iv) dispositions and encumbrances
for adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. To the Knowledge of CBSI, all leases pursuant to which CBSI or
any of its Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases real and personal property which,
individually or in the aggregate, are material to the business of Wilber on a
consolidated basis are valid and enforceable against the lessor in accordance
with their respective terms.

  

  

4.18. CBSI Information. The information regarding CBSI and its Subsidiaries to
be supplied by CBSI for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any filings
or approvals under applicable state securities laws, or any filing pursuant to
Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the
Exchange Act will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The portions of the Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that relate to CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.19. Agreements with and Examination by Banking Authorities. Except as
Previously Disclosed, neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any commitment, letter (other than letters addressed to regulated depository
institutions generally), written agreement, memorandum of understanding, order
to cease and desist with, is subject to any order or directive specifically
naming or referring to CBSI or any of its Subsidiaries by, has been required
to adopt any board resolution by, any federal or state governmental entity
charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or bank holding companies
or engaged in the insurance of bank deposits which is currently in effect, and
neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice from any such
federal or state governmental entity that any such Person may be required to
enter into, or otherwise be subject to, any such commitment, letter, written
agreement, memorandum of understanding or cease or desist order. Except as
Previously Disclosed, neither CBSI nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
informed by any bank regulator that it is contemplating issuing, requesting or
amending any such order, directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding,
commitment letter or similar submission.

  

 

 

  

 

ARTICLE V

 

  

  

COVENANTS

  

  

5.1. Shareholders' Meeting. Wilber shall call and give notice of the Wilber
Shareholders' Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement contemplated by Section 5.2 is first declared effective by the SEC,
but in no event later than 10 days after the date of such effectiveness (the
"Registration Statement Effective Date"), for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement, and Wilber shall use all reasonable efforts to
hold the Wilber Shareholders' Meeting as soon as practicable after the
Registration Statement Effective Date, subject to the applicable notice
requirements under the NYBCL. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of Wilber, as determined after consultation with outside counsel and
financial advisors, (i) the Board of Directors of Wilber shall recommend that
the shareholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement, and (ii)
Wilber shall solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of approval of
this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or desirable to
secure the vote of shareholders to obtain such approval. Notwithstanding any
withdrawal, modification or change in any recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Wilber, Wilber agrees to hold the Wilber Shareholders' Meeting
within the time period specified above unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

5.2. Proxy Statement; Registration Statement. As promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, CBSI shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with
the SEC, and Wilber shall cooperate in the preparation of the Registration
Statement, which shall include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the shareholders of Wilber in connection with obtaining their approval of this
Agreement. CBSI will advise Wilber, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of
the issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of qualification of the CBSI
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information. If, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to a party to this
Agreement, or its directors, officers or shareholders who have filed a
Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act, shall be discovered by such party that
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus included therein, such party shall promptly notify the
other party. To the extent applicable, CBSI shall take all actions necessary
to register or qualify the shares of CBSI Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger pursuant to all applicable state "blue sky" or securities laws and
shall maintain such registrations or qualifications in effect for all purposes
hereof. CBSI shall apply for, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain,
approval to list the shares of CBSI Common Stock to be issued in the Merger on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.3. Applications.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and after a reasonable
opportunity for review by the other party and its counsel, CBSI and Wilber
shall submit any requisite applications for prior approval of, and notices
with respect to, the Transactions to the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board,
and each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
submit any applications, notices or other filings to any other state or
federal government agency, department or body, the approval of which is
required or desirable for consummation of the Merger. Wilber and CBSI each
represents and warrants to the other that all information concerning it and
its directors, officers, shareholders and Subsidiaries included (or submitted
for inclusion) in any such application and furnished by it shall be true,
correct and complete in all material respects. Each party agrees to consult
with the other party with respect to obtaining all necessary approvals and
consents and each will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to such approvals and consents, including providing the other party
with copies of all material written communications to, or received from, any
regulatory authority in respect of the Transactions. The parties agree to
cooperate with each other in seeking regulatory approvals by, among other
things, providing each other with information which may be necessary or
advisable in connection with any application to or filing with, any regulatory
authority.

  

  

(b) Wilber has submitted and hereafter may submit one or more applications to
the appropriate regulatory authorities to approve the payment of severance,
separation or change-of-control payments owed to an employee or former
employee pursuant to a contract or a Wilber Plan. In the event that any such
application remains pending at the Effective Time, CBSI will pursue the
application before the regulatory authorities in good faith until a
determination is made.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.4. Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CBSI and Wilber
shall each use reasonable best efforts in good faith to (i) furnish such
information as may be required or desirable in connection with the preparation
of the documents referred to in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 above, and (ii) take or
cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable on its part so as to
permit consummation of the Merger at the earliest possible date, including,
without limitation, (1) obtaining the consent or approval of Persons whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the Transactions, provided
that Wilber shall not agree to make any payments or modifications to
agreements in connection therewith without the prior written consent of CBSI,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (2)
requesting the delivery of appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its
counsel and independent auditors. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, no party hereto shall take or fail to take, or cause or permit its
Subsidiaries to take or fail to take, or to the best of its ability permit to
be taken or not to be taken by any third party, any action that would
substantially impair the prospects of completing the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement, that would materially delay such completion, or that would
adversely affect the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In the event that either party has
taken any action, whether before, on or after the date hereof, that would
adversely affect such qualification, each party shall take such action as the
other party may reasonably request to cure such effect to the extent curable
without a Material Adverse Effect on either of the parties.

  

  

(b) Each party hereto shall give prompt notice to the other party of (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure
would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at any time from the date hereof
to the Closing Date such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
6.3(a), as applicable, would not be met if such failure to be true or accurate
were to occur or be continuing on the Closing Date, and (ii) any material
failure of any party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and each party
shall use all reasonable best efforts in good faith to remedy such failure.

  

  

(c) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by law, Wilber shall cause Wilber Bank to provide such assistance to
Community Bank as reasonably necessary for Community Bank to prepare for the
conversion and transfer in connection with the Merger all information
concerning the loans, deposits and other assets and liabilities of Wilber Bank
into Community Bank's own data processing system, with a view to facilitating
the integration of Community Bank's and Wilber Bank's systems and otherwise
combining Community Bank's and Wilber Bank's operations upon consummation of
the Merger. Such assistance shall include providing Community Bank with
computer file instructions with respect to the information in its data
processing system regarding the assets and liabilities of Wilber Bank,
together with operational procedures designed to implement the transfer of
such information to Community Bank, provided that the confidentiality of
customer information shall be preserved and no information shall be
transferred until the Effective Time. After execution of this Agreement,
Wilber Bank and Community Bank shall each designate an individual to serve as
liaison concerning the transfer of data processing information and other
similar operational matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Wilber shall not
enter into, extend, modify, terminate, or allow to expire, any agreement with
a third party vendor providing information technology or data processing
services or software to Wilber or Wilber Bank without the prior written
consent of CBSI, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Each party shall provide, and shall request its auditors to provide, the
other party with such historical financial information regarding it (and
related audit reports and consents) as the other party may reasonably request
for disclosure purposes under the Securities Laws.

  

  

5.5. Investigation and Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Wilber and CBSI each will keep the other advised of all material
developments relevant to its and its Subsidiaries' businesses and to
consummation of the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) representatives of Wilber and CBSI shall confer periodically
regarding the financial condition, assets, liabilities, operations and
business of Wilber and Wilber Bank and matters relating to the completion of
the Transactions, and (ii) as soon as reasonably available, but in no event
more than three (3) business days after filing, Wilber shall furnish to CBSI
all reports filed by it or Wilber Bank with, and all material notices received
by it or Wilber Bank from, any regulatory authority subsequent to the date
hereof, subject to any regulatory requirements to maintain the confidentiality
of such reports and notices.

  

  

(b) Wilber and CBSI each may make or cause to be made such investigation of
the financial and legal condition of the other as such party reasonably deems
necessary or advisable in connection with the Transactions, provided, however,
that such investigation shall be reasonably related to such transactions and
the party conducting such investigation shall use its reasonable best efforts
to minimize any disruptions to the operations of the other party. CBSI and
Wilber agree to furnish the other and the other's advisors with such financial
data, assets, liabilities and other information with respect to its business
and properties as such other party shall from time to time reasonably request,
including, without limitation, information with respect to Wilber's delinquent
or problem Loans of the nature described in Section 3.7 and Section 3.11.

  

  

(c) Promptly following the occurrence of an event or fact which, if such event
or fact had occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been Previously Disclosed to the other party, each party
shall update its disclosure letter required to be delivered under the terms of
this Agreement unless such event or fact is disclosed in an SEC Document filed
with the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Wilber shall
provide CBSI, no later than fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, a
written update on each of its delinquent and problem Loans of the nature
described in Section 3.7 and Section 3.11.

  

  

(d) No update of a party's disclosure letter after the date hereof, and no
investigation done after the date hereof pursuant to this Section 5.5 or
otherwise, shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by, or the conditions to the obligations to consummate the Merger of, any
party hereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Each party hereto shall hold all information furnished by the other party
or any of such party's Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to this
Agreement in confidence and in accordance with the confidentiality agreements
dated August 4, 2010 and October 1, 2010, between Wilber and CBSI
(collectively, the "Confidentiality Agreements").

  

  

5.6. Press Releases and Other Public Disclosures. Wilber and CBSI shall agree
with each other as to the form and substance of any press release related to
this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall consult and agree with each
other as to the form and substance of other public disclosures related
thereto, including without limitation, any communications with securities
market professionals and investors, provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prohibit any party, following notification to the other parties,
from making any disclosure which is required by applicable law or NYSE rules.

  

  

5.7. Actions Pending the Merger.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, and except as otherwise provided for by this
Agreement or consented to or approved in writing by the other party hereto,
each of CBSI and Wilber shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to preserve its properties, business and
relationships with customers, employees and other persons.

  

  

(b) Except with the prior written consent of CBSI (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) or as expressly permitted by this Agreement,

in substantially the same manner as heretofore conducted, or incur an

regular and ordinary course of business);

  

  

(2) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution in
respect of its capital stock or earnings other than its regular quarterly cash

(3) issue any shares of its capital stock or permit any treasury shares to
become outstanding; redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its
capital stock or any securities or obligations convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock;

  

  

(4) incur any additional debt obligation or other obligation for borrowed
money other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice;

exercisability of any outstanding Rights) or effect any recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or like change in
capitalization, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its
capital stock;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39

practice); make any capital expenditure in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate;
or establish new branches or other similar facilities, close existing branches
or similar facilities or enter into or modify any leases or other contracts
relating thereto;

  

  

(10) increase the rate of compensation of, pay or agree to pay any bonus to,
or provide any additional employee benefit or incentive (including without
limitation, any "change of control" or severance payment) to, any of its
directors, officers or employees except as required by law or contractual
obligation in effect as of the date hereof; or become party to, adopt,
terminate, amend, or commit itself to, any pension, retirement, profit sharing
or welfare benefit plan or agreement or employment agreement, other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or except as
required by existing plans or agreements (provided that Wilber may amend its
vacation pay policy to increase the number of vacation days an employee may
carry over from one year to another from five days to ten days); or accelerate
the vesting of any deferred compensation other than as required by existing
plans or agreements;

  

  

(11) change its lending, investment, asset/liability management or other
material banking policies in any material respect except as may be required by
changes in applicable law or changes required by a regulatory authority;

  

  

(12) change its methods of accounting in effect at December 31, 2009, except
as required by changes in GAAP concurred in by its independent certified
public accountants, or change any of its methods of reporting income,
deductions or other items for federal income tax purposes from those employed
in the preparation of its federal income tax returns for the year ended
December 31, 2009, except as required by applicable law;

  

  

(13) take any action that could result in (i) any of its representations or
warranties in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respects
at any time prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any of the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied, except as may be required
by law or (iii) materially delaying the receipt of necessary regulatory
approvals for the Transactions except as may be required by law or regulatory
requirement; or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(14) agree to do any of the foregoing or take any other action which would in
any manner interfere with, impede, delay, or make more costly the consummation
of the Transactions.

  

  

(c) CBSI shall not, except with the prior written consent of Wilber (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed) or as expressly
permitted by this Agreement, carry on its business other than in the usual,
regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as heretofore
conducted; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent CBSI from acquiring or agreeing to acquire any Person, by merging or
consolidating with, by purchasing an equity interest in or a portion of the
assets of, or by any other manner, such Person or taking actions reasonably
related thereto, so long as such transaction would not materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

5.8. Conforming Policies.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Wilber shall, consistent with GAAP and
applicable law, and on a basis mutually satisfactory to it and CBSI, use its
best efforts to modify and change its accounting, investment, loan, litigation
and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications, content and size of investment portfolio, and levels of
reserves and accruals) so as to be applied, in all material respects, on a
basis that is consistent with that of CBSI. Prior to the Effective Time,
Wilber and CBSI shall review the adequacy of reserves for loan losses
currently established by Wilber and, if deemed warranted by both parties under
GAAP, Wilber shall make mutually acceptable changes to such reserves. Wilber
shall cooperate with CBSI in planned actions discussed as part of the due
diligence process which are designed to improve the short and long-term
performance of Wilber and eliminate or reduce any potential earnings per share
dilution of CBSI upon consummation of the Merger.

  

  

(b) Wilber shall consult with CBSI with respect to determining the amount and
timing of recognizing, for financial accounting and income Tax reporting
purposes, Wilber's expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and,
subject to GAAP and applicable law, Wilber shall recognize its costs and
expenses in connection with the Transactions at such time or times as are
reasonably requested by CBSI.

  

  

5.9. Closing. The Transactions shall be consummated at a closing to take place
at the offices of Bond, Schoeneck and King, PLLC on the first business day, or
other mutually agreeable time, following satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to consummation of the Merger set forth in Article VI hereof.
Alternatively, the parties may agree that the Closing shall occur without
their or their counsel's physical presence in the same location, through the
transmission and execution of documents and instruments using electronic
media, including, but not limited to, email and facsimile. Digital signatures
produced by such means shall have the same force and effect as handwritten
signatures. If the parties elect to use this method for the Closing, following
the Closing, they shall promptly execute handwritten documents and instruments
and exchange the signature pages thereof so that each party shall have a
complete set of manually signed documents memorializing the Closing.

  

  

5.10. Affiliates. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Wilber and
CBSI shall cooperate and use their best reasonable efforts to identify those
Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Wilber within the meaning of
Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. Wilber and CBSI
shall use their respective best reasonable efforts to cause each person so
identified to deliver to CBSI or Wilber, as the case may be, no later than 30
days after the date hereof, an Affiliates Agreement, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C (collectively, the "Affiliates Agreement").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.11. Employee Benefits; Directors and Management; Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The current employees of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries who continue as
employees of CBSI or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time shall be given
credit for past service with Wilber for purposes of determining eligibility
for and vesting of employee benefits (but not for pension benefit accrual
purposes) under all welfare and retirement programs maintained by CBSI or its
Subsidiaries in which such employees participate following the Merger. In the
event that the employment of any current employee of Wilber or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be terminated without cause after the Effective Time, such
employee shall be entitled (subject to meeting applicable eligibility and
vesting requirements) to receive (i) for any such employee terminated within
twelve months after the Effective Time, severance benefits in accordance with
the terms of the Wilber severance plan in effect on the date hereof, (ii) for
any such employee terminated later than twelve months after the Effective
Time, severance benefits in accordance with the terms of the CBSI severance
plan in effect on the date of termination, and (iii) credit under Wilber's or
CBSI's vacation policy (as applicable) for service after January 1, 2011 of
the greater of (y) one week's vacation plus documented unused vacation days
carried over from the prior year, or (z) the number of weeks vacation
determined in accordance with Wilber's vacation policy (if such termination is
effective at the Effective Time) or CBSI's vacation policy (if such
termination is effective after the Effective Time) plus documented unused
vacation days carried over from the prior year, which vacation time, if not
used prior to the date of termination, shall be paid in lump sum upon
termination of employment.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Wilber shall take all actions that may be
requested by CBSI in writing upon advance notice of not less than 30 days with
respect to (i) causing one or more Wilber Plans to terminate as of the
Effective Time or for benefit accrual and entitlements to cease as of the
Effective Time, (ii) causing the continuation on and after the Effective Time
of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to any Wilber Plan
for such period as may be requested by CBSI, or (iii) cooperating with CBSI to
facilitate the merger of any Wilber Plan into any CBSI Plan as of or following
the Effective Time; provided that advance notice of not less than 90 days
shall be provided with respect to the termination of Wilber's defined benefit
pension plan or 401K plan.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, CBSI shall cause its Board of Directors and
Community Bank's Board of Directors to take all requisite actions to expand
the size thereof by two directors and appoint Brian R. Wright and Alfred S.
Whittet (collectively, the "Nominees") as directors of CBSI and Community Bank
to fill the vacancies created by the expansion, effective as of the Effective
Time. Each Nominee shall be appointed to CBSI's Board and Community Bank's
Board provided that, in the exercise of their fiduciary duties, the Boards of
CBSI and Community Bank have determined that each such person satisfies all
requirements generally applicable to nominees and directors serving on the
Boards of CBSI and Community Bank, including requirements under applicable law
and regulations, CBSI's and Community Bank's Bylaws, and CBSI's Corporate
Governance Guidelines as administered by its Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee. Subject to the exercise of the fiduciary duties of
CBSI's Board of Directors, CBSI shall cause the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee to nominate, and shall cause its Board to recommend for
election, the Nominees at CBSI's 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. In the
event a Nominee resigns or otherwise becomes ineligible to serve prior to the
2011 annual meeting, a majority of the members of the Advisory Board shall be
entitled to recommend to CBSI's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
an individual to serve as his or her replacement. Such substitute nominee must
meet all of the qualifications for serving on the Boards of CBSI and Community
Bank that generally may apply to nominees and directors at the time of
election. Nothing contained in this Section 5.11(c) shall be construed to
limit the ability of the respective Boards of Directors of CBSI and Community
Bank to further increase the size of such Boards from time to time as they may
deem appropriate.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) (1) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any person (the "Indemnified Party") who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of Wilber is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or
employee of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) this Agreement or any
of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, CBSI shall, for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL upon
receipt of any undertaking required by the DGCL), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation
with CBSI; provided, however, that (1) CBSI shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and upon such assumption CBSI shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if CBSI elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between CBSI and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after notification, and CBSI shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) CBSI shall
be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties, (3) CBSI shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, and (4) CBSI shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.11(d),
upon becoming aware of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify CBSI thereof, provided that the failure
of any Indemnified Party to so notify CBSI shall relieve it of its obligations
to indemnify hereunder to the extent that such failure materially prejudices
CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(2) To the extent that the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and similar
governing documents of Wilber and its Subsidiaries entitle the directors,
officers and employees of Wilber and its Subsidiaries to indemnification
rights greater than those provided in subparagraph (1) above, CBSI agrees that
all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in
favor of the directors, officers and employees of Wilber and any of its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation,
bylaws or similar governing documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall
survive the Merger, and shall continue in full force and effect, and shall be
honored by such entities or their respective successors as if they were the
indemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment thereto, for a period of
six years from the Effective Time.

  

  

(3) CBSI will use its reasonable best efforts directly or indirectly to cause
the persons who served as directors or officers of Wilber on or before the
Effective Time to be covered by Wilber's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy (provided that CBSI may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) but in no event
shall any insured person be entitled under this Section to insurance coverage
more favorable than that provided to him or her in such capacities as of the
date hereof with respect to acts or omissions resulting from their service as
such on or prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance coverage shall commence
at the Effective Time and will be provided for a period of no less than six
years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall CBSI
be required to expend more than 150% of the current amount expended by Wilber
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. Prior to the
Effective Time, Wilber agrees to renew any such existing insurance or to
purchase any "discovery period" insurance provided for thereunder at CBSI's
request.

  

  

5.12. Dividends; Termination of DRIP Plan. After the date of this Agreement,
CBSI and Wilber shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of
any dividends in respect of CBSI Common Stock and Wilber Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Wilber Common Stock shall not receive dividends
other than regular dividends thereon, subject to any regulatory limitations,
or fail to receive such regular dividends subject to any regulatory
limitations, for any calendar quarter prior to the Effective Time with respect
to their shares of Wilber Common Stock and for any calendar quarter following
the Effective Time with respect to any shares of CBSI Common Stock that such
holder receives as Merger Consideration. Wilber shall suspend its DRIP Plan
effective as of the date of this Agreement with the effect that no additional
shares of Wilber Common Stock shall be issued thereunder prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement. Prompt notice of such
suspension shall be given to all Wilber shareholders. Upon the Effective Time,
the DRIP Plan shall be terminated, and Wilber and CBSI shall cooperate in
providing any required notice of such termination of such termination to the
shareholders of Wilber.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.13. Advisory Board. Promptly following the Effective Time, CBSI shall cause
Community Bank to be form an advisory board (the "Advisory Board") and invite
each member of Wilber's Board of Directors (other than members who are elected
to CBSI's Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.11(c)) to serve on the
Advisory Board. The Advisory Board shall be comprised of such Directors of
Wilber who accept the invitation to serve on it, and the President and Chief
Executive Officer of CBSI. The purpose and function of the Advisory Board will
be to advise Community Bank on deposit, lending and financial services
activities in Wilber's former market area and to insure a smooth transition of
business relationships in connection with the Merger and the continued
development of business relationships throughout such market area. Each member
of the Advisory Board, other than the President and Chief Executive Officer of
CBSI, shall be paid for each meeting he or she actually attends an amount
equal to (i) $5,000 per quarter divided by (ii) the number of meetings held in
any given quarter, in cash, in consideration for his or her services on the
Advisory Board. The term of the Advisory Board shall be for a two-year period
following the Effective Time.

  

  

5.14. Takeover Laws. No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the Transactions to be subject to the requirements imposed by any Takeover
Law, and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) all such transactions from, or
if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable
Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. For purposes of this Section,
"Takeover Law" shall mean (a) any law or regulation regulating hostile
takeovers, or mergers, business combinations, sale of control, affiliate
transactions involving interested shareholders or related parties, or (b) any
antitrust law or regulation which is applicable to the Transactions.

  

  

5.15. No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.15(b) hereof, from and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither Wilber nor any Person acting
on behalf of Wilber shall, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or
respond to discussions or engage in negotiations with any Person (whether such
negotiations are initiated by Wilber or otherwise) or take any other action
intended or designed to facilitate the efforts of any Person, other than CBSI,
relating to the possible acquisition, recapitalization or other business
combination involving Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries (whether by way of
merger, purchase of capital stock, purchase of assets or otherwise) or any
material portion of its capital stock or assets (with any such efforts by any
such Person, including a firm proposal to make such an acquisition, to be
referred to as "Takeover Proposal"), (b) provide non-public information with
respect to Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, other than CBSI
and its professional advisors or Wilber's professional advisors, or (c) enter
into an agreement, or a letter of intent or term sheet, with any Person, other
than CBSI, providing for a possible Takeover Proposal. If Wilber receives any
offer or proposal relating to a Takeover Proposal, Wilber shall immediately
notify CBSI thereof, including information as to the identity of the party
making any such offer or proposal and the specific terms of such offer or
proposal, as the case may be.

  

  

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.15(a),
prior to the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, Wilber may, to the extent the Board of Directors of Wilber
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the Board's fiduciary duties require it to do so, participate in discussions
or negotiations with, and, subject to the requirements of Section 5.15(c),
furnish non-public information, and afford access to the properties, books or
records of Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries, to any Person after such Person
has delivered to Wilber in writing an unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal
with respect to Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries (which has not been
withdrawn) which the Board of Directors of Wilber in its good faith judgment
determines, after reasonable inquiry and consultation with its financial
advisor (i) would be reasonably likely to result in a transaction more
favorable than that contemplated by this Agreement to the shareholders of
Wilber (which judgment must be reasonable), and (ii) that the Person making
such Takeover Proposal is financially capable of consummating such Takeover
Proposal or that the financing necessary to consummate such Takeover Proposal,
to the extent required, is then committed or is capable of being obtained by
such Person (a "Superior Proposal"). In addition, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 5.15(a) above, in connection with a submitted, written
bona fide Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal, Wilber shall refer
any third party to this Section 5.15 or make a copy of this Section 5.15
available to such third party.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) In the event Wilber or any of its Subsidiaries receives a Superior
Proposal, nothing contained in this Agreement (but subject to the terms of
this Section 5.15(b)) will prevent the Board of Directors of Wilber from
recommending such Superior Proposal to the shareholders of Wilber, if the
Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that such action is required by its fiduciary duties; in such case,
the Board of Directors of Wilber may withdraw, modify or refrain from making
its recommendations set forth in the relevant sections in this Agreement;
provided, however, that Wilber shall (A) provide CBSI at least 96 hours prior
notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors of Wilber at which such Board
of Directors is reasonably expected to consider a Superior Proposal, (B) not
recommend to its shareholders a Superior Proposal for a period of not less
than the greater of four full business days and 96 hours after CBSI's receipt
of a copy of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party, and
(C) not enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal
unless CBSI fails to match the terms of the Super Proposal within the greater
of four full business days and 96 hours after CBSI's receipt of a copy of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party; and provided, further,
that unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VII, nothing
contained in this Section 5.15(b) shall limit Wilber's obligation to hold and
convene a special meeting of its shareholders (regardless of whether the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Wilber shall have been withdrawn,
modified or not yet made) or to provide the shareholders of Wilber with
material information relating to such meeting.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Wilber nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall provide any non-public information to a third party
unless: (x) Wilber provides such non-public information pursuant to a
nondisclosure agreement with terms regarding the protection of oral or written
confidential information substantially equivalent to the terms in the
Confidentiality Agreements heretofore entered into by the parties hereto; and
(y) such non-public information has been previously delivered or made
available to CBSI.

additional conditions at or prior to the Closing Date unless waived by Wilber

any representation and warranty which specifically relates to an earlier date,
as of such earlier date), except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
or consented to in writing by Wilber and except for inaccuracies of
representations or warranties which, individually or in the aggregate, do not
constitute and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material

determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, no effect
shall be given to any qualifications or exceptions in such representations and

(e) Dissenters' rights shall not have been exercised with respect to more than
2% of the outstanding shares of Wilber Common Stock;

  

  

(f) The required regulatory approvals approving the Transactions shall contain
no condition or requirement which (i) imposes obligations or conditions on
Wilber or CBSI that would be more burdensome in any material respect than
those contained in the written agreement between Wilber and the OCC dated
October 13, 2010 (such as by imposing a capital requirement higher than that
set forth in such OCC agreement), or (ii) would likely result in a Material
Adverse Effect on CBSI following the consummation of the Transactions; and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) To the extent that any material lease, license, loan, financing agreement

TERMINATION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT

  

  

7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, either before or after approval by the shareholders of Wilber
or CBSI:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent duly authorized by the respective Boards of
Directors of the parties hereto;

  

  

(b) by CBSI in writing, if Wilber has, or by Wilber in writing, if CBSI has,
breached (i) any covenant or agreement contained herein or (ii) any
representation or warranty contained herein, and in either case if (x) to the
extent that such breach is curable, such breach has not been cured within 30
days after the date on which written notice thereof is given to the breaching
party and (y) such breach would entitle the non-breaching party not to
consummate the Transactions under Article VI hereof;

  

  

(c) by any party hereto in writing, if the applications for prior approval
referred to in Section 5.3 hereof have been finally denied, and the time
period for appeals and requests for reconsideration has expired, or if any
governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;

  

  

(d) by any party hereto in writing, if the shareholders of Wilber do not
approve this Agreement and the Transactions at the special meeting duly called
for that purpose;

  

  

(e) by any party hereto in writing, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by the close of business on May 31, 2011, unless the failure to so
consummate by such date shall be principally due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements set forth herein;

  

  

(f) by CBSI, if (i) the Board of Directors of Wilber shall withdraw, modify or
change its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Transactions in
a manner adverse to CBSI, or Wilber shall have failed to include in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus the recommendation of its Board of Directors in favor of
the approval of this Agreement or the Transactions; (ii) following its receipt
of a Takeover Proposal or the public announcement of a Takeover Proposal,
Wilber shall fail to timely comply with the covenants contained in Section
5.2; (iii) the Board of Directors of Wilber shall have recommended to the
shareholders of Wilber a Superior Proposal, or Wilber shall have executed a
letter of intent, a definitive agreement or similar document with respect to a
Superior Proposal; (iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of
the outstanding shares of Wilber Common Stock is commenced and Wilber shall
not have sent to its shareholders, within 10 business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement that the Board of
Directors of Wilber recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (v)
a Takeover Proposal (other than a tender or exchange offer covered by clause
(iv) of this Section 7.1(f)) with respect to Wilber is publicly announced and,
upon CBSI's request, Wilber fails to issue a press release announcing its
opposition to such Takeover Proposal within three (3) business days after such
request; or (vi) the Board of Directors of Wilber shall have resolved to take
any action described in clauses (i) and (iii) of this Section 7.1(f);

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) by Wilber, if the Board of Directors of Wilber shall have recommended to
the shareholders of Wilber a Superior Proposal, or Wilber shall have executed
a letter of intent, a definitive agreement or similar document with respect to
a Superior Proposal, in each case in accordance with Section 5.15, provided
that Wilber has complied with all provisions thereof.

  

  

7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1 hereof, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect,
except that (i) the provisions of Sections 5.5. 7.6 and 8.1 hereof shall
survive any such termination and (ii) a termination pursuant to Section 7.1
shall not relieve the breaching party from liability for any willful breach of
such covenant or agreement or representation or warranty giving rise to such
termination.

  

  

7.3. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall expire on, and be terminated and
extinguished at, the Effective Time other than covenants that by their terms
are to survive or be performed after the Effective Time; provided, that no
such representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated
or extinguished so as to deprive CBSI or Wilber (or any director, officer or
controlling person thereof) of any defense in law or equity which otherwise
would be available against the claims of any Person, including, without
limitation, any shareholder or former shareholder of either CBSI or Wilber,
the aforesaid representations, warranties and covenants being material
inducements to the consummation by CBSI and Wilber of the Transactions.

  

  

7.4. Waiver. Except where not permitted by law, CBSI or Wilber, by written
instrument signed by an executive officer of such party, may at any time
(whether before or after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
Wilber) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, and may waive (i) any inaccuracies of such other
party in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any
document delivered pursuant hereto, (ii) compliance with any of the covenants,
undertakings or agreements of such other party, or satisfaction of any of the
conditions precedent to its obligations, contained herein or (iii) the
performance by such other party of any of its obligations set out herein or
therein. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise
of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of,
or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

  

  

7.5. Amendment or Supplement. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at
any time prior to the Effective Time only by mutual agreement of the parties
hereto or thereto. Any such amendment or supplement must be in writing and
approved by their respective Boards of Directors; provided, however, that,
after approval of this Agreement by the respective shareholders of Wilber or
CBSI, no amendment may be made which by law requires further approval by such
shareholders without obtaining such further approval.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.6. Fee and Expenses.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.6, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including fees and
expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and counsel) shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not such transactions
are consummated, except that CBSI and Wilber each shall bear and pay 50% of
all printing and mailing costs and filing fees associated with the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

  

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by CBSI or Wilber pursuant
to Section 7.1(f) or (g), or by either party pursuant to Section 7.1(b), (d)
or (e) after a Takeover Proposal from a third party is received by Wilber or
any of its affiliates, or is made public (unless CBSI or Wilber is then in
breach of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement such that conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) or 6.1(b) would not
be satisfied, and Wilber shall have given written notice to that effect prior
to such termination), then Wilber shall pay in immediately available funds to
an account designated by CBSI, no later than three (3) business days after the
date of such termination, a fee equal to Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000), as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

  

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) prior to the time a Takeover Proposal from a third party is
received by Wilber or any of its affiliates or is made public, then Wilber
shall pay in immediately available funds to an account designated by CBSI, no
later than three (3) business days after the date of such termination, all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, professional
fees of legal counsel, financial advisors and accountants, and their expenses)
actually incurred by CBSI and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transactions and this Agreement, such costs and expenses not to exceed in the
aggregate Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

EXHIBIT A

  


 

  

Form of Voting Agreement

  


 

  

VOTING AGREEMENT

  


 

  

This Voting Agreement, dated as of October __, 2010 (this "Agreement"), is by
and among Community Bank System, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CBSI"), and
the undersigned shareholder (the "Shareholder") of The Wilber Corporation
("Wilber").

  


 

  

RECITALS

  


 

  

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, CBSI and Wilber entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides
for the merger (the "Merger") of Wilber with and into CBSI. Pursuant to the
Merger, shares of capital stock of Wilber will be converted into merger
consideration, consisting of cash and shares of common stock of CBSI, on the
basis set forth in the Merger Agreement.

  


 

  

B. The Shareholder has the legal power to vote, or to direct the voting of (by
law, contract or otherwise), the shares of the outstanding common stock of
Wilber indicated on the final page of this Agreement (the "Shares").

  


 

  

C. As a material inducement to enter into the Merger Agreement, CBSI desires
the Shareholder to agree, and the Shareholder is willing to agree, to vote or
cause to be voted, as the case may be, the Shares and any other such shares of
capital stock of Wilber subsequently acquired by the Shareholder so as to
facilitate consummation of the Merger as provided in this Agreement.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

  


 

  

1. Agreement to Vote Shares; Additional Purchases.

  


 

  

1.1 Agreement to Vote Shares. At every meeting of the shareholders of Wilber
called with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement and/or the Merger,
and at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written
consent of the shareholders of Wilber with respect to the approval of the
Merger Agreement and/or the Merger, the Shareholder shall vote, or cause to be
voted, the Shares and any New Shares (as defined below) in favor of adoption
and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

  


 

  

1.2 Agreement to Retain Shares. The Shareholder shall not transfer, sell,
exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Shares or any New
Shares; provided, however, that the Shareholder may transfer the Shares if the
transferee, prior to such transfer, executes a voting agreement with respect
to the Shares to be transferred, substantially in the form of this Agreement,
and provides such executed agreement to CBSI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

1.3 Additional Purchases. The Shareholder agrees that any shares ("New
Shares") of capital stock of Wilber that the Shareholder purchases or with
respect to which the Shareholder otherwise acquires the power to vote, or to
direct the voting, after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined below) shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted Shares.

  


 

  

2. Representations and Warranties of the Shareholder. The Shareholder (i) has the legal power and authority to vote, or to direct the voting of, the Shares, which at the date hereof are (except to the extent set forth in a schedule delivered herewith) free and clear of any liens, options, security interests or other similar encumbrances; (ii) does not possess the right to vote, or to direct the voting of, any shares of capital stock of Wilber other than the Shares; and (iii) has full power and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

3. Additional Documents. The Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents necessary, including a proxy, in the reasonable opinion of CBSI, to carry out the purpose of this Agreement.

  


 

  

4. Consent and Waiver. Shareholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any agreements to which Shareholder is a party or pursuant to any rights Shareholder may have.

  


 

  

5. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the earlier to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article VII thereof (the "Expiration Date").

  


 

  

6. Miscellaneous.

  


 

  

6.1 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

  


 

  

6.2 Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by any
of the parties without prior written consent of the other parties.

  


 

  

6.3 Amendments and Modification. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written
agreement executed by the parties hereto.

  

  

6.4 Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge
that CBSI will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy
at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of the
Shareholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to CBSI upon any such violation, CBSI
shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific
performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to CBSI at law
or in equity.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57

Illustration of Application of Section 2.2(f)(i)

  


 

  


 

  

Assuming there are 10,719,382 shares of Wilber Common Stock outstanding on the
Effective Date , if (w) there are 10,000 shares entitled to receive Merger
Consideration in the form of cash pursuant to Section 2.2(f)(iv), (x) there
are no Dissenting Shares, (y) the holders of 2,000,000 shares exercise the All
Cash Election, and (z) the holders of 1,000,000 shares exercise the Mixed
Election, a total of 3,010,000 shares will have elected or be entitled to
receive cash, which exceeds 2,143,876 shares (representing 20% of the
outstanding shares). In such event, 866,124 shares (the excess above 20%) will
be converted from the All Cash Election to the All Stock Election. This
conversion will be accomplished by reducing the number of shares tendered by
each holder electing the All Cash Election by 43.31% (the quotient obtained by
dividing 866,124 by 2,000,000) and adding those shares to the All Stock
Election.

Form of Affiliates Agreement

  


 

  

October ___, 2010

  


 

  


 

  

Community Bank System, Inc.

  

5790 Widewaters Parkway

  

Dewitt, New York 13214

  


 

  

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

  


 

  

The undersigned is a director, executive officer and/or 10%-or-greater
shareholder of The Wilber Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"),
and is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of such number of shares (the "Shares") of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") as is indicated on the last page hereof.

  


 

  

The undersigned has been made aware that the Company and Community Bank
System, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CBSI"), have entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), providing for certain
transactions pursuant to which the Company would be merged with and into CBSI
(the "Merger"). In order to induce CBSI to consummate the Merger, the
undersigned agrees and undertakes, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of
the Company, as follows:

  

  

 

1. Covenants under Rule 145.

  

 

  

(a) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of CBSI issuable to the undersigned pursuant
to the Merger ("CBSI Common Shares") will be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement"). The undersigned has also
been advised that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company
at the time the Merger is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the
Company, as the term "affiliate" is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act,
and as such, will be subject to Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act.
Accordingly, the undersigned agrees that, subject to CBSI's compliance with
its obligations herein, he or she will not sell or otherwise dispose of any
CBSI Common Shares, except (i) in accordance with Rule 145(d) promulgated
under the Securities Act, (ii) at such time as a registration statement under
the Securities Act covering resales of such CBSI Common Shares is effective,
or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to CBSI (which opinion may be based upon a "no-action" or
interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC), is not required to be
registered under the Securities Act.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

Generally speaking, this means that, in any given three month period the
undersigned may not sell or otherwise dispose of a number of CBSI Common
Shares which exceeds the greater of (i) 1% of the then outstanding number of
CBSI Common Shares, or (ii) the average weekly trading volume of CBSI Common
Shares during the four weeks preceding the sale. In addition, any CBSI Common
Shares must be sold in a brokers' transaction or in a direct transaction with
a market maker. The restrictions discussed in this paragraph are only
applicable for a one year period following the closing of the Merger, unless
the undersigned becomes an "affiliate" of CBSI as a result of the Merger or
otherwise, in which case the undersigned will continue to be subject to
similar restrictions under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.

  


 

  

(b) The undersigned understands and agrees that: (i) CBSI is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the CBSI
Common Shares under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities
laws, except pursuant to the Registration Statement which will cover only the
primary issuance of the CBSI Common Shares in the Merger; (ii) stop transfer
instructions will be given to the transfer agent of CBSI with respect to the
CBSI Common Shares and there will be placed on the certificate(s) representing
such stock, or any certificate(s) delivered in substitution therefor, a legend
stating in substance:

  


 

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
TO WHICH RULE 145 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") APPLIES. THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 145(d) OR PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
OR EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT."

  


 

  

Unless the transfer by the undersigned is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145(d), or is made pursuant to a registration statement
under the Securities Act or the stop transfer instructions or legends have
previously been terminated or removed, CBSI reserves the right to put an
appropriate Securities Act legend on the certificate issued to a transferee of
the undersigned. CBSI agrees that the stop transfer instructions and legends
referred to above shall be promptly terminated or removed if the undersigned
or any permissible transferee shall have delivered to CBSI a copy of a letter
from the staff of the SEC or an opinion of counsel with recognized expertise
in securities law matters, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
CBSI, to the effect that such instructions and legends are not required for
the purposes of the Securities Act.

  

  

 

2. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect only as of such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms.

  

  

3. Remedies. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that any remedy at law for breach of the foregoing provisions shall be inadequate and that, in addition to any other relief which may be available, CBSI shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relieve without the necessity of proving monetary damages or posting a bond.

  

 

  

4. Enforcement. The undersigned represents that he or she has the capacity to enter into this Agreement and that it is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the undersigned in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting creditor's rights and general equitable principles.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

  


 

  

6. Current Public Information. CBSI agrees, by accepting this letter, that for a period of two years after the Effective Time of the Merger (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145) and thereafter three months after the undersigned ceases to be an affiliate of CBSI (if applicable) and so long as CBSI has any class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; CBSI will make publicly available with respect to itself "adequate current public information" as defined in paragraph (c) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

  


 

  

7. No Admission. Execution of this letter shall not be construed as an admission on the undersigned's part that he or she is an "affiliate" of the Company as described in this letter or as a waiver of any rights that undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
