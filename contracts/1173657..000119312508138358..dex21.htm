NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement,
the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

I. THE TENDER OFFER

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII hereof, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that such ten (10) Business Day period
shall be extended to such date as the Company is ready to file the Schedule
14D-9 on the same date as the commencement of the Offer. The obligation of
Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay
for any Shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject to
the satisfaction of those conditions set forth in Annex I. The conditions to
the Offer set forth on Annex I are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Purchaser and each of Parent and Purchaser expressly reserves the right from
time to time, subject to Sections 1.1(b) and 1.1(d) hereof, to waive any such
condition, to increase the Offer Price, or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer. The Company agrees that no Shares held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be tendered pursuant to the
Offer.

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent
nor Purchaser shall (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of
consideration payable in  



 

2  the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the
Offer, (iii) amend or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Tender Condition (as
defined in Annex I), (iv) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the
conditions to the Offer set forth on Annex I, (v) add to, amend or modify the
conditions to the Offer set forth on Annex I in any manner that is adverse to
the holders of the Shares, or (vi) undertake any extension of the Offer not
specifically provided for or contemplated in this Agreement.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") having such terms and conditions as are set forth in Annex I
hereto. As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments, exhibits and
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer that
shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable
federal securities laws, and shall contain (including as an exhibit)
or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and forms of the related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (which documents, together
with any supplements, exhibits or amendments thereto, and any other schedule
or form which is filed in connection with the Offer and related transactions,
are referred to collectively herein as the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Parent
and Purchaser shall give the Company one (1) Business Day advance notice prior
to filing the Schedule TO. Parent and Purchaser shall disseminate the Offer
Documents to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Purchaser all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser for
inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser
hereby further agree that the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed
with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect
to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents. The Company hereby agrees that the information provided by or on
behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by or on behalf of it for use in the Schedule TO or
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Purchaser shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as
amended, to reflect such corrected information, to be filed with the SEC and
the other Offer Documents, as amended to reflect such corrected information,
to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser
shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.  



 

3  In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and Parent and Purchaser
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the
Offer to Purchase shall provide that the Offer shall expire at midnight, New
York time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Purchaser agrees that it shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer or extend the expiration date of the Offer
unless at the expiration date of the Offer the conditions to the Offer
described in Annex I hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived
or, in the case of termination, such termination is in connection with the
termination of this Agreement. Subject to the rights of the Purchaser to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, if at the
expiration date of the Offer, the conditions to the Offer described in Annex I
hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, either the Company or
Parent may cause Purchaser to for one (1) or more consecutive increments of
not more than five (5) Business Days, extend the expiration date of the Offer
until the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived and Purchaser
becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, without the consent
of the Company, cause Purchaser to (i) extend the expiration date of the Offer
(as it may be extended) for any period required by applicable
rules, interpretations and regulations of the SEC in connection with the
Offer and (ii) extend the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended)
for up to two periods, each for up to five (5) Business Days, if on such
expiration date the conditions for the Offer described on Annex I hereto
shall have been satisfied or earlier waived, but the number of Shares that
have been validly tendered and not withdrawn, when added to the Shares, if
any, beneficially owned by Parent represents less than ninety percent (90%)
of the then issued and outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Purchaser (or Parent on its behalf) may, in
its sole discretion, elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the
Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act and
(ii) in addition, Purchaser shall, if requested by the Company, make available
a subsequent offering period in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-11 of
not less than ten (10) Business Days.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Offer, Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended) and
in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange
Act. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or during any subsequent offering period shall
be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest, subject to
reduction only for any dividends or other distributions declared thereon
between the date hereof and the Acceptance Time. Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, the funds necessary to
pay for any Shares that Purchaser accepts or is obligated to accept for
payment pursuant to the Offer.



 

4 Section 1.2. _Company Actions_.

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company hereby consents
to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents,
subject to the right of the Company Board to withdraw, modify or amend its
recommendation in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.4 of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that (i) shall comply in all
material respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities
laws and (ii) shall include the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
referred to in Section 4.28 hereof. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents
shall contain the recommendations of the Company Board described in Section
1.2(a) hereof. The Company shall disseminate, and shall cooperate with Parent
and Purchaser in disseminating, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents to
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the
Company upon request all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that may
be required by applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by the
Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company hereby further
agrees that, when filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or
given to the Companys stockholders, the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty is
made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or
Purchaser specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser hereby agree that the information
provided by them specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as amended, to reflect such corrected
information, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give due
consideration to all the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall
provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
 



 

5  to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and
the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or shall cause its
transfer agent to, promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares,
any available computer files containing the names and addresses of all record
and beneficial holders of Shares and security position listings of Shares held
in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish
Parent with such additional information, including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request for
the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
mailing labels, security position listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger.

Section 1.3. _Company Board and Committees_.

(a) Effective upon the initial acceptance for payment by Purchaser of Shares
pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ", the use of which term
herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether
Parent shall exercise its rights under this Section 1.3(a)), and from time to
time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate directors to
serve on the Company Board up to such number of directors equal to the product
(rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in
the number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of Shares held by Parent and Purchaser
(giving effect to the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the
denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding Shares. Promptly
following a request by Parent, the Company shall use its best efforts
(including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary) to cause
the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including (at the election of the Company) by increasing the
size of the Company Board and/or by seeking and accepting the resignations of
such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the
individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board. At such time, the Company shall also cause, if requested by Parent, the
board of directors (or similar governing body) of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries to include Persons designated by Parent constituting the same
percentage of each such board as Parents designees constitute on the Company
Board. From time to time after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate)
as is on the Company Board on each committee of the Company Board and
each committee of the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted by all  



 

6  applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ; _provided_ , however, each committee
shall be comprised of at least one Independent Director. If requested
by Parent and permitted by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, promptly after the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be
treated as a "controlled company" as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules
and shall make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such
status.

(b) Until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least two (2)
directors who are directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement and
who are not officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Independent
Directors_ "); provided. however, that if the number of Independent Directors
shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever (or if immediately
following consummation of the Offer there are not at least two (2) then-
existing directors of the Company who are (A) Qualified Persons and (B)
willing to serve as Independent Directors), then the number of Independent
Directors required hereunder shall be one (1), unless the remaining
Independent Director is able to identify a person who is not then an officer
or Affiliate of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(any such person being referred to herein as a " _Qualified Person_ "; it
being understood that, for purposes of this definition, a person that would
otherwise be considered an Affiliate of the Company shall not be deemed an
Affiliate of the Company solely because he or she is a director of the
Company) willing to serve as an Independent Director, in which case such
remaining Independent Director shall be entitled to designate any such
Qualified Person to fill such vacancy, and such designated Qualified Person
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement,
or if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall
be required to designate two (2) Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies,
and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to this
Section 1.3 and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3,
including mailing to the Companys stockholders the information required by
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers
as is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3. The Companys obligation to elect or
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a)
hereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. Parent shall provide to the Company, and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates, required by such Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of
this Section 1.3 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that
Parent, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Parent or Purchaser may have (with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a
holder or beneficial owner of Shares.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company
Board prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.3(a) hereof and there
shall be any Independent Directors, the approval of a majority of such
Independent Directors (or both Independent  



 

7  Directors if there shall be only two (2) Independent Directors) shall be
required in order to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the
Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, if such
actions would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other
than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this
Agreement if such waiver would materially and adversely affect the holders of
Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any other action of
the Company Board under or in connection with this Agreement if such action
would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent
or Purchaser).

Section 1.4. _Top-Up Option_.

(a) _Top-Up Option_.

(i) Subject to Section 1.4(a)(ii) and Section 1.4(a)(iii) hereof, the Company
grants to Parent and Purchaser an assignable and irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-issued
shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of
(i) the number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option, constitutes one (1) Share more than 90% of the Shares of
Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving effect
to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) or (ii) the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under its
Certificate of Incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and
are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only
once, at such time as Purchaser owns at least eighty percent (80%) of the
shares of Common Stock then outstanding and provide notice of exercise of the
Top-Up Option prior to the tenth (10) Business Day after the later of the
expiration date of the Offer or the expiration date of any subsequent offering
period.

(ii) Subject to the last sentence of Section 1.4(a)(i), the Top-Up Option may
be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time at or
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not
be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of
shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, Parent and Purchaser will
collectively hold at least 90 percent (90%) of the Shares of Common Stock then
outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares). The
aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Common Stock being
purchased by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the
Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Purchaser, at its
election, either entirely in cash or by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the purchase
price. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per
annum, shall mature not later than the fifth anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without
premium or penalty.



 

8 (iii) In the event Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company at least one (1) Business
Days prior written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that Parent or Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-
Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or Purchaser intends to pay the
applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of
the purchase of such Shares by Parent or Purchaser is to take place. At the
closing of the purchase of such Shares of Common Stock, Parent or Purchaser
shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for such Shares, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Parent or Purchaser (as the case may be) a certificate representing
such Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue Shares in connection with
the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (x) no
provision of any applicable Law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree
shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Shares
in respect of such exercise, (y) the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up
Option would not require approval of the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law or regulation (including, without limitation, NASDAQ
National Market rules and regulations, including Section 4350) and (z) Parent
or Purchaser has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered
in the Offer and not withdrawn. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that
the issuance of the Shares upon exercise of the Top-Up Option is accomplished
in a manner consistent with all applicable legal requirements of any
Governmental Entity, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ ").

Section 1.5. _Stock Options/Restricted Shares/Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. Each option to purchase Shares (individually
a " _Stock Option_ " and collectively, the " _Stock Options_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to any Equity Incentive Plan
or otherwise shall, without any action on the part of any holder of any
Option, become fully exercisable and vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Stock Option outstanding as of the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Option shall,
in full satisfaction of such Stock Option and in exchange for the surrender
to the Company of any certificate or other document evidencing such Stock
Option, receive from the Company an amount (the " _Option Consideration_ ") in
cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Stock Option
multiplied by (y) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Option (with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest whole cent). If the
applicable exercise price of any Stock Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, such Stock Option shall be cancelled without payment of
additional consideration, and all rights with respect to such Stock Option
shall terminate as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Option Consideration otherwise payable such amounts as may be required for any
applicable federal back-up withholding or other Taxes payable by the holder
of such Stock Option. The holders of Stock Options shall have no further
rights in respect of any Stock Options from and after the Acceptance Time.
Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Company shall pay
the aggregate amount due to holders of Stock Options pursuant to this Section
1.5(a).



 

9 (b) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time, any then outstanding restricted shares of Company Common Stock issued
pursuant to any Equity Incentive Plans or otherwise (the " _Restricted Shares_
") shall become fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse. For the
avoidance of doubt, holders of Restricted Shares shall be permitted to tender
such Restricted Shares in to the Offer subject to the conditions and in
accordance with the terms of the Offer.

(c) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Following the earlier to
occur of (i) the end of the Purchase Interval (as defined in the ESPP) in
effect as of the date hereof and (ii) the Acceptance Time, no additional
payroll deductions (or other contributions) shall be made pursuant to the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "). After the date
hereof, no Participant (as defined in the ESPP) shall be permitted to increase
the rate of his or her payroll deduction above the rate in effect as of the
date hereof (or such lesser rate as may be reduced by the Participant
following the date hereof). The rights of participants in the ESPP with
respect to any offering period currently underway under the ESPP shall be
determined by treating the earlier of (i) the last Business Day of the current
Purchase Interval or (ii) the last Business Day prior to the Acceptance Time,
as the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but
otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP. As of the
Acceptance Time, the ESPP shall be terminated.

(d) _Treatment of Equity Incentive Plans_. Effective as of the Effective Time,
(i) the Equity Incentive Plans shall terminate, and (ii) no holder of a Stock
Option issued pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plans or any other participant
in the Equity Incentive Plans shall have any rights pursuant to an Equity
Incentive Plan to acquire any equity securities of, or to receive any payments
in consideration for any outstanding awards from, Parent, the Purchaser,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, except as expressly provided in this Section 1.5.

(e)  _Further Assurances_. Prior to the Acceptance Time (or for purposes of
Section 1.5(c), prior to the date hereof), the Company shall adopt such
resolutions and shall take such other actions as may be required to effectuate
the actions contemplated by this Section 1.5, without paying any
consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

II. THE MERGER

Section 2.1.  _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set

(b) the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall thereupon cease and
(c) the Company shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as

Company and Purchaser, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Willkie  



 

10  Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00

those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (the
date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ "). 

Section 2.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251
of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Purchaser
and the Company in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 2.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and

Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the
Purchaser shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.5. _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time
so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions, contained

of Purchaser until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and as provided by Law, except for Article I thereof, which shall read
"the name of the corporation is Barrier Therapeutics, Inc." and (b) the

thereafter changed or amended as provided therein, in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law. 

Section 2.6. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors
of Purchaser and the officers of the Company, in each case, as of the

earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

III. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 3.1. _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company:

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock that is
owned by Parent, Purchaser (including Shares received in the Offer) or the
Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than Shares held in a fiduciary
capacity on behalf of third parties) shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



 

11 (b) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be
cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and (ii) Dissenting
Shares (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ")) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to reduction for any dividends or other distributions declared thereon
between the date hereof and the Effective Time payable upon surrender of such
Shares in the manner provided in Section 3.2.

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and all such Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and, subject to Section 3.3, each holder of a certificate
formerly representing any such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with Section 3.2.

(d) _Conversion of Purchaser Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.2. _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate, or
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as agent for the holders of
the shares for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article III from time to time
after the Effective Time. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash
in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) upon surrender of such Certificates
(such cash being herein referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). Purchaser
shall enter into a paying agent agreement on customary terms, which terms
shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to
the Effective Time. Pending disbursement to the holders of Shares, the Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of  



 

12  commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available) or in
money market funds. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be property of and payable to the Parent.
Parent shall ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times sufficient to fully
satisfy the cash payment obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this
Agreement.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than Excluded Shares),
whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or
effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate
may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares any amounts that are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments under the
Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(d) _No Further Transfers_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such
Certificates and at the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with  



 

13  respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Paying Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article III.

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, on demand, and
any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a
general creditor thereof for payment of his or her claims for Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount and upon such terms as the Surviving Corporation may
determine are necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. 

Section 3.3. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a
stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares and
otherwise properly perfects and does not withdraw or lose his or her rights
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Such Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance
with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares
held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner
provided in Article III and shall no longer be Excluded Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.3, if
the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be
paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received
by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such
demands.



 

14 Section 3.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction,
the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

IV. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as (i) set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") delivered by the
Company to Parent and Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any section of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other
section of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to
such other section) or (ii) in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company
for the year ended December 31, 2007 (the " _Company Form 10-K_ "), the
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with
the SEC from the date of the filing of the Company Form 10-K to the date of
this Agreement (other than disclosures in the risk factor or forward-looking
statements sections or any other disclosures included therein to the extent
such statements are predictive or forward-looking in nature and excluding any
documents or disclosure incorporated therein by reference or filed as exhibits
or annexes thereto) to the extent the qualification of the representations of
the Company is readily apparent from the disclosure in such documents, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

Section 4.1.  _Organization; Power; Qualification_. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business as
a foreign corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the assets and
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its
organizational or governing documents. Complete and correct copies of the
Company Organizational Documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

Section 4.2. _Corporate Authorization; Enforceability_. (a) The Company has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and, subject to adoption of this Agreement by
the Requisite Company Vote in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
Board, at a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this  



 

15  Agreement, duly: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement with Parent and Purchaser, (ii) approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger,
the Top-Up Option and the issuance of Shares of Common Stock upon the exercise
thereof and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their
Shares pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement and, if required to
consummate the Merger, vote their Shares in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (clauses, (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and (iv) directed that such matter be submitted for
consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, except in the case of the Merger
which is subject to the Requisite Company Vote.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except
as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally, and (ii) the availability of equitable remedies.

Section 4.3. _Capitalization; Options_. (a) The Companys authorized capital
stock consists solely of 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Preferred
Stock_ "). As of the close of business on June 16, 2008 (the " _Measurement
Date_ "), (i) 35,163,367 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding,
of which 356,175 were Restricted Shares, and no shares of Preferred Stock were
issued or outstanding and (ii) there were available for grant pursuant to the
Equity Incentive Plans, Stock Options representing an aggregate of 1,013,617
shares of Common Stock. No Shares are held in the treasury of the Company or
by any of its Subsidiaries. Since the Measurement Date, other than
in connection with the issuance of Shares pursuant to the exercise of Stock
Options outstanding as of the Measurement Date, there has been no change in
the number of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or the number
of outstanding Stock Options. Section 4.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth (w) for each Stock Option issued or outstanding pursuant to the
Equity Incentive Plans or otherwise, the number of Stock Options, the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable thereunder and the exercise or conversion
price relating thereto, (x) for each Restricted Share issued or outstanding
pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plans, the purchase price, (y) the aggregate
number of Stock Options and Restricted Shares issued and outstanding as of
the Measurement Date and the weighted average exercise price of the issued and
outstanding Stock Options, and (z) the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock that will be purchased pursuant to the ESPP after giving effect to
Section 1.5(c) above. Except as set forth in this Section 4.3, there are no
shares of capital stock or securities or other rights convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock of the Company
or such securities or other rights (which term, for purposes of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to include "phantom" stock or other commitments
that provide any right to receive value or benefits similar to such capital
stock, securities or other rights). Since

except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses or accelerations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company) as
Parent or Purchaser reasonably may request and (ii) all documents (including,
without limitation, financial, operating and other data) that Parent or
Purchaser reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent,
Purchaser and their Representatives shall not have access to any books,

information) or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to, or the making, announcement, submission or the completion of, a
Takeover Proposal;

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions (other than to request
clarification (and without providing any information regarding the Company to
any third party) of an unsolicited Takeover Proposal that did not result from
a breach of Section 6.4 to the  



 

42  extent that outside counsel advises that such Takeover Proposal is not
sufficiently clear to allow the Company Board to determine whether its
fiduciary obligations would require it to exercise the rights of the Company
under Section 6.4(d)) or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or
otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or assist any Person in connection with
a Takeover Proposal;

(iii) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in any
manner adverse to Purchaser;

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made
or indicated an intention to make a Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall promptly request that each Person who has executed a confidentiality
agreement with the Company in connection with such Persons consideration of a
Takeover Proposal (other than the parties hereto and their respective
advisors) return or destroy all non-public information furnished to that
Person by or on behalf of the Company since January 1, 2008. The Company shall
promptly inform its Representatives of the Companys obligations under this
Section 6.4. Any violation of Section 6.4(a) or 6.4(b) by any Representative
of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 6.4 by the Company.

(c) The Company shall notify Purchaser promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) upon receipt by it or its Subsidiaries or Representatives of (i) any
Takeover Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making a
Takeover Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the
ordinary course of business and unrelated to a Takeover Proposal or (iii) any
inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall notify Purchaser promptly (and in any event within
48 hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such
Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is
available, a description of such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request), including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24
hours of the occurrence of any changes) as to any material developments,
discussions and negotiations with respect to any of the foregoing matters,
including furnishing copies of any written proposals and draft documentation,
and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) notify Purchaser orally and in writing if it determines to
begin providing information or to engage in discussions  



 

43  or negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal pursuant to Section 6.4(d).
The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Purchaser. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not
to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing
standstill or confidentiality agreement relating to a Takeover Proposal to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such
agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted, if it has
otherwise complied with its obligations under this Section 6.4, but only
prior to the Acceptance Time, to:

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with a Person who has made a
written Takeover Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 6.4 if, prior to taking such action, (A) the
Company enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person
and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith (1) after receiving the
advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal and (2) after receiving the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Laws;

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a Person who has made a written Takeover Proposal
that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.4 if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in
good faith (A) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) after receiving the
advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Laws, but only so long as the Company (x) has
caused such Person to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
(y) unless prohibited by applicable Law, concurrently discloses the same such
non-public information to Purchaser if such non-public information has not
previously been disclosed to Purchaser; and

(iii) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4(d)(iii), the Company
Board shall not, (x) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser or recommend or
propose publicly to recommend such a Superior Proposal (a " _Recommendation
Change_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any change or development
relating to any clinical trial of one or more products or product candidates
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any determination by the FDA or any
other Governmental Entity relating thereto shall not be a basis for a
Recommendation Change) or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into, or
otherwise authorize the entry into, any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal, any termination to be
effective only if in  



 

44  advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
Termination Fee and Purchaser Expenses in the manner provided for in Section
8.6(a); _provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled to make a
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
6.4(d)(iii) unless: (1) the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, (2) the Company shall have
given Purchaser prompt written notice advising Purchaser of (A) the decision
of the Company Board to take such action and (B) the material terms and
conditions of any applicable Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the
party making such Takeover Proposal and, if available, a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with such party and other material documents,
(3) the Company shall have given Parent three (3) Business Days (or one (1)
Business Day in the event of each subsequent material revision to any
applicable Takeover Proposal) after delivery of such notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (4) at the end of such period, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by
Purchaser, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that (A) in
the case of a Recommendation Change, failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Laws and (B) in the case of a termination of this Agreement,
that such Takeover Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the
Merger, as supplemented by any counterproposals made by Purchaser; _provided_
that, in the event the Company Board does not make the determination referred
to in clause (4) of this paragraph but thereafter determines to effect a
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
6.4(d)(iii), the procedures referred to in clauses (1)  (4) above shall
apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or
modification.

(e) Section 6.4(d) shall not prohibit the Company Board from disclosing to
the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (other than any disclosure
prohibited by Section 6.4(d)); _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure
other than (i) as required in the Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Section 1.2 or
(ii) with respect to disclosures not required in the Schedule 14D-9 pursuant
to Section 1.2, a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to
be a withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Purchaser unless the Company Board (x) expressly
reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or (y) rejects such other Takeover Proposal.

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions on " _business combinations_ " contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL (or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this
Agreement.

Section 6.5. _Notices of Certain Events_. (a) The Company shall notify
Purchaser promptly of (i) any communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this  



 

45  Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or
its Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives),

Legal Actions and (v) any event, change, occurrence, circumstance or
development between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which

7.1 of this Agreement or Annex I not to be satisfied or result in such
satisfaction being materially delayed. With respect to any of the foregoing,
the Company shall consult with Purchaser and its Representatives so as
to permit the Company and Purchaser and their respective Representatives to
cooperate to take appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate any adverse
consequences that may result from any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5(a) shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or
Purchaser or the representations or warranties of the Company, or the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Purchaser hereto.

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall notify the Company promptly of (i) any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
other Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Purchaser or its
Representatives), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from Parent, Purchaser or their Representatives), (iii) any
Legal Actions threatened in writing or commenced against or otherwise
effecting the Parent or Purchaser that are related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the responses thereto from the Parent or
Purchaser), or (iv) any event, change, occurrence, circumstance or development
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is
reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 of this
Agreement not to be satisfied or result in such satisfaction being materially
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.5(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Company or the representations or warranties of

proxy or other materials for meetings such as the Company Stockholders
Meeting, (v) to the extent required by applicable Law, as promptly as
reasonably practicable prepare, file and distribute to the Company
stockholders (in the case of the Company Proxy Statement) any supplement or
amendment to the Company Proxy Statement if any event shall occur which
requires such action at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
and (vi) otherwise use all reasonable efforts to comply with all requirements
of Law applicable to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Merger. Parent
and Purchaser shall cooperate with the Company in connection with
the preparation and filing of the Company Proxy Statement, including
furnishing the Company upon request with any and all information as may be
required to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement under the Exchange
Act. The Company shall provide Parent and Purchaser a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendments or
supplements thereto, prior to filing the same with the SEC. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Parent or Purchaser shall acquire at least 90 percent (90%)
of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, and provided that the conditions set forth in Article VII shall
have been satisfied or waived, the Company shall, at the request of Parent,
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without the approval
of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of
the DGCL.

(b) The Company Proxy Statement will include the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation to the extent permitted under Section 6.4(d).

(c) If approval of the Companys stockholders is required under Law in order
to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, the
Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the later of the
Acceptance Time or the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company
Vote. The written consent of Purchaser will be required to adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall, unless a
Recommendation Change permitted by Section 6.4(d)(iii) has occurred, (a) use
all reasonable efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its
stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and (b) take all
other reasonable action necessary to secure the Requisite Company Vote.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4, the Company shall
take all of the actions contemplated by this Section 6.6 regardless of whether
the Company Board has approved, endorsed or recommended another Takeover
Proposal or has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation, and shall submit this Agreement for adoption by the
stockholders of the Company at such meeting. The Company shall keep Parent
updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall vote all Shares
acquired in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by them or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of
Purchaser beneficially owned by it in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
in accordance with applicable Law.



 

47 Section 6.7. _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries will,
by operation of law, either become or continue employment with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time. Each employee of the of the Company
or its Subsidiaries who continues or commences employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employees_ ")
will be eligible to participate in either, at the sole discretion of Parent:
(i) Parents employee benefit plans and programs, including any equity
incentive plan, pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan,
Section 401(k) plan, bonus plan, profit sharing plan, severance plan, medical
plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time-off programs and disability
plan, in each case to the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent; or (ii) such Company Benefit Plans as are continued by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, or are assumed by Parent
(for the purposes of this Section 6.7 only, the plans referred to in clauses
"(i)" and "(ii)" of this sentence being referred to as " _Specified Parent
Benefit Plans_ "). Except as may otherwise be agreed between Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and a
Continuing Employee, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending at the close of business on December 31, 2008, each Continuing
Employee shall be entitled to receive, while in the employ of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, at least
the same cash salary or hourly wage rate, and annual cash bonus opportunity
as were provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Agreement shall in any way limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, or any subsidiary thereof, to terminate any Continuing Employee.

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
receive full credit for the years of continuous service by such Continuing
Employee recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of (i) satisfying the service requirements for participation
in each Specified Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) vesting in any benefits under
such plans, and (iii) calculating the level of benefits with respect to
severance, vacation, personal days off and any other welfare-type benefits
where service is a factor in calculating benefits, except where such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to any welfare benefit
plans maintained by Parent for the benefit of Continuing Employees located in
the United States, subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual
requirements or Laws, Parent shall (to the extent that such limitation would
not apply with respect to substantially similar plans maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), (A) cause to be
waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations,
and (B) give effect, in determining any deductible maximum out of pocket
limitations, to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees during the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs.



 

48 (c) If requested by Parent at least five business days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably
necessary pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the Closing
Date, any Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan,
then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written
evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions authorizing the
termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) As of the date hereof, Parent shall, or shall cause the Purchaser
to, establish a retention bonus plan for the benefit of certain employees of
the Company. The material terms of the retention bonus are set fourth on
Section 6.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.7, express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of any of Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them, (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or
former employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period
of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment, or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employee) any right as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

Section 6.8. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) In
the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in which any present or
former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(together, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining in whole or in part to, any action or failure to take action by
any such Person in such capacity taken prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall, from and after the
Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent permitted or required by applicable Law or the Company Organizational
Documents (or any similar organizational document) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, when applicable, and any indemnity agreements applicable to
any such Indemnified Party or any Contract between an Indemnified Party and
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the date of
this Agreement, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, legal
and other expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable legal and other
fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent
and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for
all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.



 

49 (b) The Company may, or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain prior to the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six years
from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate to the directors and officers of the Company, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ that in no event will the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such
coverage in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_
"). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be
obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain that amount of directors and officers insurance (or
"tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. The Company represents that its current annual premium for director
and officer insurance is set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 will survive the Closing and, after the
Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and its successors and
representatives after the Effective Time and their rights under this Section
6.8 are in addition to, and will not be deemed to be exclusive of, any other
rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract, the Company Organizational Documents (or similar organizational
document) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise.

(d) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries shall include and maintain in effect in their
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational
document) for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions
regarding the elimination of liability of directors (or their equivalent),
indemnification of officers and directors thereof and advancement of expenses
which are, in the aggregate with respect to each such entity, no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
contained in such organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then and in each case, proper provision will be made so that the applicable
successors, assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.



 

50 Section 6.9. _Reasonable Efforts_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable
Laws, each of the parties to this Agreement shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that
the conditions to the Offer set forth on Annex I hereto and the conditions to
the Merger set forth in Article VII are satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary
registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) making, an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, by Parent as soon as practicable and by the Company
within 10 calendar days of the date of receipt of Parents filing by the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "), (iii) making, as
promptly as practicable, appropriate filings under the competition, trade
regulation, or merger control Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction as
determined by Parent and Company, (iv) obtaining all necessary or appropriate
consents and waivers under any and all Contracts, Leases and Permits to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such
Contracts, Leases or Permits following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), and (v) obtaining
all consents, approvals or waivers from, or taking other actions with respect
to, third parties necessary or advisable to be obtained or taken in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that without the prior written consent of Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries may not pay or commit to pay any amount of cash or other
consideration, or incur or commit to incur any liability or other obligation,
in connection with obtaining such consent, approval or waiver.

(b) Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate and consult with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings, notifications
and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 6.9, subject to
applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed material written communication to any
Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other party with copies
of all filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence
between such party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any
other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a
Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that material may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (y) as necessary to address good faith legal
privilege or confidentiality concerns. Provided that the Company is not
legally required to file such document, the Company shall not file any such
document or take such action if Purchaser has reasonably objected (and not
withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such document or the taking of such
action on the grounds that such filing or action would reasonably be expected
to either (i) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) cause a condition set forth
in Article VII to not be satisfied in a timely manner. The Company shall not
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period
or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of Purchaser.



 

51 (c) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly inform the other
party upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent, Purchaser or the Company (or any of
their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Entity that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. The parties agree not to participate, or to
permit their Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. Each party shall
advise the other party promptly of any understandings, undertakings or
agreements (oral or written) which the first party proposes to make or enter
into with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party shall use all
reasonable efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Laws, including (subject to first
having used all reasonable efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such
objections) contesting and resisting any action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have
such statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party is required to,
and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
become subject to, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order (i)
to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict,
operate, invest or otherwise change any portion of the assets or business of
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates, (ii) that is materially
adverse to Parent and its Affiliates or the Company and its Affiliates,
respectively, in each case taken as a whole, either before or after giving
effect to the Offer and the Merger, (iii) that requires any material change in
the conduct of business of Parent, the Company or any of their divisions or
Subsidiaries as currently conducted relating to a material portion of the
revenues or earnings of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries, (iv) that
prohibits or restricts or seeks to prohibit or restrict the ownership or
operation by Parent (or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) of any portion
of its or the Companys business or assets which is material to the business
of all such entities taken as a whole, (v) that imposes or seeks to impose
material limitations on the ability of Parent effectively to acquire or to
hold or to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Company, (vi) that imposes or
seeks to impose any material limitations on the ability of Parent or any of
its respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries effectively to control in any
material respect the business and operations of the Company and any of the
Subsidiaries, (vii) that seeks to obtain from the Company, Parent or  



 

52  Purchaser material damages as a result of this Agreement, (viii) that would
be reasonably likely to materially impair the benefits reasonably expected to
be derived by Parent from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ix) that would, or would reasonably be likely to, impose any material cost,
liability or obligation on the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their
Subsidiaries or (viii) which otherwise is reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (each of (i)  (viii), a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall, upon the request of Purchaser, become subject to, or consent or agree
to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the
assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, so long as such
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order is binding on the
Company only in the event that the Closing occurs.

such consultation, except to the extent that the disclosing party determines

requirements, in which case that party shall use all reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any
such public statement.

Section 6.11. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,

all expenses (including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any
party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_ ") will be paid
by the party incurring those Expenses, except (a) the Company shall pay all
of the Expenses incurred in connection with preparing, filing, printing and

date of delivery of such list, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of
changes to such list.

promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been
made or relied upon by any of the parties to this Agreement.

Section 9.9. _No Limitation on Other Representations_. Except as otherwise

72 Section 9.10. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section
6.8 (Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance) and with respect
to the receipt of the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration which

and Certificates only, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.8 shall not
arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among
the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.8 without notice or liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.11. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement are severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable
and equitable provision will be substituted for that provision in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances will
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that
provision, or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.12. _Rules of Construction_. The parties to this Agreement have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or other document.

Section 9.13. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other
parties hereto; _provided_ that prior to the mailing of the Company Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a constituent entity in lieu of Purchaser, in which event all references
herein to Purchaser shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement shall be  



 

73  deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation, _provided_ that any
such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the
rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section will be null and void.

Section 9.14. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. 

Section 9.15. _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur, damages would be difficult to determine and would be an
insufficient remedy and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in
equity, in each case in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, in the event of
a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the other parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware as provided in
Section 9.5, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any
defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity,
that might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any
of the terms or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in any action brought
therefor by any other party hereto.

Section 9.16. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, including by facsimile transmission, all of which
will be one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective only
when actually signed by each party hereto and each such party has received
counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

75 ANNEX I

_Conditions to the Offer_

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer, but subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Parents or Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered
Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for
any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (A) the Minimum Tender
Condition (as defined below) has been satisfied and (B) (i) the waiting
period applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act (or any
extension thereof) will have expired or been terminated; and (ii) all other
approvals or consents required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity,
the failure of which to be obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, shall have been obtained. The term "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ " shall mean the sum of the number of Shares which
have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Offer which together represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted
Shares. The term " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities
entitled generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a
fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all
vested options (other than Stock Options), rights and securities exercisable
or convertible into such voting securities. Capitalized terms that are used
but not otherwise defined in this Annex I shall have the respective meanings
ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to commence the Offer
or accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for, and may delay the
acceptance for payment of, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer if, at
any time on or after the date of this Agreement (unless cured as contemplated
by Section 8.3(c)) and before the expiration or termination of the Offer, any
of the following conditions exists:

(a) there shall be an injunction or other order, decree, judgment or ruling
issued by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or a statute, rule,
regulation, executive order or other action shall have been enacted,
promulgated or taken by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction which
in any such case (i) restrains or prohibits or seeks to restrain or prohibit
the making or consummation of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or
the performance of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or
(ii) imposes a Budensome Condition; or

(b) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred or
been discovered any event, change, occurrence or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

(c)(i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement shall not be true and correct at such time (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date), in each case except where the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation
on any representation or warranty indicated by the words "materiality" or
"Company    Material Adverse Effect" or "Knowledge of the Company") would not, or would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (ii) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.3(d),
4.3(h), and 4.7(a) shall not be true and correct in all respects at such time
(except, in the case of Section 4.3(a), for such inaccuracies as are de
minimis in the aggregate);

(d) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations, or failed to comply in all material respects with the agreements
and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by it pursuant to
the Agreement; or

(e) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or

(f) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate executed
on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that such officers have read the
matters set forth in sections (b), (c) and (d) that such matters have not
occurred.

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of the
rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, may be waived by
Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time, at the sole discretion
of Parent or Purchaser. The failure by Parent, Purchaser or any other
Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.
