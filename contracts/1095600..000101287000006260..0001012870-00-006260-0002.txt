collectively referred to herein as the "Company Preferred Stock," and the
Company Preferred Stock and  ----------------------- the Company Common
Stock are collectively referred to herein as the "Company  ------- Stock")
as is set forth in Schedule 1.01 (such stockholders being referred

----------------------   1    WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, each
outstanding share of the Company Stock and all outstanding options or other

the right to receive shares of Parent\'s authorized Common Stock, $.0001 par
value per share ("Parent Common Stock"), at  ------------------- the rate

follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER  ----------   SECTION 1.01 The
Merger. Upon the terms of this Agreement and subject to  ---------- the
conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL, at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 
---------------------   SECTION 1.02 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as
practicable following  ----------------------- the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (or such other
date as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto), the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State 
--------------------- of the State of Delaware. The term "Effective Time"
means the date and time of  ------------- such filing (or such later time as
may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate
of Merger). Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, a
closing (the "Closing") will be held at the offices  ------- of Gunderson
Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP ("Gunderson 
--------- Dettmer"), 155 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California
94025 -------   2   (or such other place as the parties may agree). The
date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date."  ------------   SECTION 1.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of  -------------------- the Merger shall be as provided in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.04
Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. (a) At the Effective 
------------------------------------ Time, the Certificate of Incorporation
of Merger Sub, attached hereto as Exhibit  ------- B, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until - thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; provided,
however, that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation shall be --------
------- amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Entera,
Inc."   (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
Bylaws.   SECTION 1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub 
---------------------- immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.   ARTICLE II   MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 
----------------------------------------------   SECTION 2.01 Merger
Consideration.  --------------------   (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (i) each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.05)) shall be converted into the right to receive the Common
Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 2.01(b));   (ii) each share of Company
Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Stock
owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be  
3   cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and   (iii)
each share of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
(b) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:   (i) "Aggregate Merger Consideration" means 3,504,274
shares  ------------------------------ of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent
Shares").  -------------   (ii) "Escrow Shares" means 350,427 Parent
Shares.  -------------   (iii) "Common Exchange Ratio" means 0.107657 of a
share of  --------------------- Parent Common Stock; provided, however, that
to the extent that the Company\'s  -------- ------- capitalization
representation in Section 3.04 is incorrect or the Company breaches the
covenant contained in Section 5.01(b), with such breach of the covenant
resulting in additional securities of the Company being outstanding, the
Common Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted as of the Closing
to reflect such error or breach.   (c) If, during the period between the
date hereof and the Effective Time, any change in the capital stock of Parent
shall occur by reason of reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period or any similar event, the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, the Common Exchange Ratio and the Escrow
Shares shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares.   (d) If any shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested and/or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement,
stock option exercise agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the
Parent Shares issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will
also be unvested and/or subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such Parent
Shares may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.   SECTION 2.02
Exchange of Certificates.  ------------------------   (a) Exchange
Procedures. From and after the Effective Time, a bank or 
------------------- trust company to be designated by Parent shall act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in effecting the exchange of the
applicable Parent Shares for  -------------- certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock
("Company Share Certificates") and that were 
-------------------------- converted into the right to receive the applicable
Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.01. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record
holder of Company Share Certificates a letter of   4   transmittal (the
"Letter of Transmittal") in a form approved by Parent and the 
--------------------- Company and instructions for use in surrendering such
Company Share Certificates and receiving Parent Shares pursuant to Section
2.01. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than 5
business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
deposited in trust with the Exchange Agent the Parent Shares (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) less the Escrow
Shares.   Upon the surrender of each Company Share Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by Parent:   (i) Parent shall cause to be issued to the holder of such
Company Share Certificate in exchange therefor a separate stock
certificate representing the Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.01 (less the Escrow Shares attributable to the pro rata
interest of such holder in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e); and   (ii)
the Company Share Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled.   In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the applicable Parent Shares may be issued to a person other than the person
in whose name the Company Share Certificate so surrendered is registered if
the Company Share Certificate representing such shares of Company Stock is
presented to Parent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and evidence that (i) the shares are transferable and
(ii) any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, each Company Share
Certificate shall, subject to appraisal rights under the DGCL, the California
Corporations Code ("California Law") and Section 2.05, be deemed at 
-------------- any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon surrender the applicable Parent Shares with respect to the
shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.02(e).   (b) Escrow Fund. Prior to or simultaneously
with the  ----------- Closing, the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent
shall enter into an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") with an escrow
agent selected by Parent and  ---------------- reasonably acceptable to the
Stockholders\' Representative (the "Escrow Agent"), 
------------ substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Pursuant to the
terms of the  ---------------- Escrow Agreement, at the Closing, Parent
shall deposit one or more certificates representing, in the aggregate, the
Escrow Shares to be deposited by each holder of Company Stock into an escrow
account, which account is to be managed by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Account"). Any Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account are 
-------------- referred to herein as the "Escrow Fund." In connection with
such deposit of the  ----------- Escrow Shares with the Escrow Agent and as
of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Stock will be deemed to have
received and deposited with the Escrow Agent each stockholder\'s pro rata
interest in the Escrow Fund as determined as of Closing by reference to such
stockholder\'s ownership of shares   5   of Company Stock (plus any
additional shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or
recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective Time with respect to
shares constituting the Escrow Fund), without any act of any stockholder of
the Company. Distributions of any Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account shall
be governed by the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. The adoption
of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the
Company (the "Company Stockholders") shall constitute  -------
------------ approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all the arrangements
relating thereto, including, without limitation, the placement of the Escrow
Shares in escrow and the appointment of the Stockholders\' Representative. No
Escrow Shares shall be contributed in respect of any Company Option or any
other security exercisable or convertible into Company Stock. The percentage
of Parent Shares contributed to the Escrow Fund with respect to each holder
of Company Stock that are unvested or subject to any right of repurchase,
risk of forfeiture or other condition in favor of the Surviving Corporation
shall be proportional to the percentage of such holder\'s Company Stock that
are unvested or subject to any right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture or
other condition in favor of the Company; provided, however, that any payments
due to Parent from the Escrow Fund  -------- ------- shall first be
satisfied by delivering to Parent, to the extent available, with respect to
each holder of Company Stock, such Escrow Shares that are fully vested or
otherwise not subject to any right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture or other
restriction in favor of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) Distributions with
Respect to Unexchanged Parent Shares. No 
------------------------------------------------------- dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Shares comprising part of the Aggregate Merger Consideration with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Company Share Certificate with respect to the Parent
Shares represented thereby until the holder of such Company Share Certificate
shall surrender such Company Share Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.02.   (d) No Further Rights in Company Stock. All Parent Shares
issued  ---------------------------------- upon conversion of shares of
Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (and any cash paid in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Stock.   (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip
representing  -------------------- fractional Parent Shares shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Company Share Certificates, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of a fractional
share interest shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests
then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) $117.   (f)
No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation 
------------ shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any
such shares of Company Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash properly and legally delivered to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (g) Withholding
Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and  ------------------ Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this   6   Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.   (h) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary  ---------- contained in this Agreement, no Parent Shares (or
certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Company Stock
Certificates to any person who, prior to the Effective Time, may be an
"affiliate" (as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")) of the Company until such person
shall have delivered to Parent and the Company a duly executed Affiliate
Agreement as contemplated by Section 6.09.   (i) Lost Certificates. If any
Company Share Certificate shall  ----------------- have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Share Certificate, Parent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Share Certificate, the applicable Parent
Shares (and dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) to which such
person is entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.   (j)
Return of Parent Shares. Promptly following the end of the 
----------------------- second full calendar month after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall return to the Surviving Corporation all of the
remaining Parent Shares and the Exchange Agent\'s duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, upon the surrender of a Company Share Certificate to the
Surviving Corporation and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Surviving Corporation, and subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and similar laws, the holder of such Company Share Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Parent Shares (and
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) without any interest
thereon.   SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the
stock  -------------------- transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Stock, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by Law (as defined in Section 3.06).  
SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, the Parent 
--------------------- shall assume (i) all options to purchase Common Stock
issued by the Company pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 3.04(b)) or otherwise, whether vested or unvested (each a "Company
Option"), and (ii) the Company Stock Plans, with respect to outstanding  
7   Company Options. Immediately after the Effective Time, each Company
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Company Option at the Effective Time, such number
of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of such option
multiplied by the Common Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
number). The exercise price per share of each such assumed Company Option
shall be equal to the exercise price of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Common Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). The term, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, and all of the
other terms of the Company Options shall otherwise remain unchanged. It is
the intention of the parties that the Company Options so assumed by Parent
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Options qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Continuous employment
with the Company will be credited to the holder of a Company Option for
purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to exercise after the Effective Time. Within 30 business days after the
Effective Time, Parent will issue to each person who, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, was a holder of a Company Option a document evidencing
the foregoing assumption of such option by Parent. Promptly after
the Effective Time, but in any event not later than 20 days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms) that will register the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to assumed Company Options to the extent
permitted by Federal securities laws and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options
remain outstanding.   SECTION 2.05 Dissenting Shares. 
-----------------   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who have exercised
and perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Stock in accordance
with the DGCL (and, if the Company is subject to Section 2115 of the
California Law, such rights as may be granted to such persons in Chapter 13
of the California Law) (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or  ----------------- represent the right to receive the
applicable Parent Shares (or cash in lieu of fractional shares). Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Stock held by them in accordance with the DGCL (and,
if Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California Law, such rights as
may be granted to such persons in Chapter 13 of the California Law), unless
and until such stockholders fail to perfect or withdraw or otherwise lose
their appraisal rights under the DGCL (or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the
California Law). All Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock under the DGCL (or,
if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Law) shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable Parent Shares (or cash in
lieu of fractional shares), without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in
the manner provided in Section 2.02, including   8   the provision of
the Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(b), of their Company Share
Certificates.   (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL (or,
if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Law) and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL (or, if applicable Chapter 13
of the California Law). The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   ARTICLE III 
-----------   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 
---------------------------------------------   Except as set forth in the

------------------------------ corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change in or effect on
the business  ------------------------------- of the Company that is, or
could reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to the business,
operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets (tangible or
intangible), liabilities or results of operations of the Company taken as a
whole, except for any such changes or effects principally resulting from or
principally arising in connection with (i) any occurrence or
condition affecting the market for Internet streaming technology generally
that does not disproportionately impact the Company, (ii) any changes in
general economic conditions or (iii) the effect of the public announcement or
pendency of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the customers,
suppliers, advertisers, employees or revenues of the Company.   SECTION
3.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has 
--------------------------------------- heretofore made available to Parent a
complete and correct copy of (a) the Certificate of Incorporation and the
Bylaws of the Company, including all amendments thereto, (b) the minute  
9   books containing all consents, actions and meetings of the stockholders
of the Company and the Company\'s Board of Directors and any committees

Bylaws. The corporate minute books, stock certificate books, stock registers
and other corporate records of the Company are complete and accurate, and the
signatures appearing on all documents contained therein are the true or
facsimile signatures of the persons purported to have signed the same.  
SECTION 3.03 Subsidiaries. The Company does not control, directly or 
------------ indirectly, or have any direct or indirect equity participation
or similar interest in any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust or other business association.   SECTION 3.04

shares of Preferred Stock, of which 8,200,000 shares are designated as
Company Series A Preferred Stock, 8,000,000 shares are designated as Company
Series B Preferred Stock, and 3,300,000 shares are designated as Company
Series C Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, (i) 11,842,634 shares of
Company Common Stock are issued and outstanding, all of which are duly

(A) 8,173,232 shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock are issued and
outstanding, (B) 7,920,409 shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding, and (C) 3,270,727 shares of Company Series
C Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding, all of which are duly

of the date hereof, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock and Company Series
C Preferred Stock are owned as set forth in Section 3.04(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Section 3.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule also
provides an accurate and complete description of the terms of each repurchase
option that is held by the Company and to which any of such shares is
subject. Neither the consummation of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor any action taken or to be taken by Company in connection with
such transactions, will result in (i) any acceleration of vesting in favor of
any stockholder of the Company; (ii) any additional benefits for any
stockholder of the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement); or
(iii) the inability of Parent after the Effective Time to exercise any right
or benefit held by Company prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
Company Stock, including, without limitation, the right to repurchase a
stockholder\'s unvested shares on termination of such stockholder\'s
employment.   (b) The Company has reserved 221,668 shares of Company
Common Stock for issuance under the Company\'s 1999 Equity Incentive Plan
(the "1999  ---- Equity Incentive Plan"), of which options to purchase
221,668 shares of Company --------------------- Common Stock are
outstanding   10   as of the date of this Agreement. The Company has
reserved 7,265,928 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance under the
Company\'s 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2000 Equity Incentive Plan", and

the "Company Stock Plans"), of which 2,088,594 shares of Company Common 
------------------- Stock have been issued and are included in the number of
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock set forth in Section
3.04(a) above, and of which options to purchase 1,121,606 shares of Company
Common Stock are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. Section

to each Company Option that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement:

Plan under which such option was granted, (iii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to which such Company Option is
exercisable; (iv) the date on which such Company Option was granted and the
term of such Company Option; (v) the vesting schedule for such Company
Option; (vi) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock purchasable
under such Company Option; and (vii) whether such Company Option has been
designated an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code.
No Company Option will by its term require an adjustment in connection with
the Merger (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). Neither
the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor any
action taken or to be taken by Company in connection with such transactions,
will result in (i) any acceleration of vesting in favor of any optionee under
any Company Option; (ii) any additional benefits for any optionee under any
Company Option (other than as contemplated by this Agreement); or (iii) the
inability of Parent after the Effective Time to exercise any right or benefit
held by Company prior to the Effective Time with respect to any Company
Option assumed by Parent, including, without limitation, the right to
repurchase an optionee\'s unvested shares on termination of such optionee\'s
employment. The assumption by Parent of Company Options in accordance with
Section 2.04 hereunder will not (i) give the optionees additional benefits
that they did not have under their options prior to such assumption (after
taking into account the existing provisions of the options, such as their
respective exercise prices and vesting schedules) and (ii) constitute a
breach of any of the Company Stock Plans or any agreement entered into
pursuant to such plans.   (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.04(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to
issue or sell any share of capital stock of, or other equity interest in, the
Company. All shares of Company Stock so subject to issuance, upon issuance on
the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they
are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any share of capital stock
of, or other equity interest in, the Company. There are no contractual
obligations of the Company to provide funds to, or make any investment in (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise), any other person. The
holders of Company Options have been or will be given, or shall have properly
waived, any required notice of the Merger prior thereto, and all such rights,
if any, will terminate at or prior to the Effective Time.   (d) All of the
securities sold or issued by the Company have been sold or issued in
compliance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws and any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.   11    (e) Except as set
forth in Section 3.04(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has
never repurchased, redeemed or otherwise reacquired any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company.   (f) An updated Section 3.04 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule reflecting changes permitted by this
Agreement in the capitalization of Company between the date hereof and the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Company to Parent on the Closing
Date.   SECTION 3.05 Authority Relative to This Agreement. (a) The Company
has  ------------------------------------ all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the

or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company pursuant to, any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not, require any consent, approval, order, authorization, registration or

for the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents
as --- required by the DGCL, and (iii) where failure to obtain such

or director of the Company. The Company has no express or implied
commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (x) to create, incur

plan, program or arrangement, (y) to enter into any contract or agreement to
provide compensation or benefits to any individual, or (z) to modify, change

termination required by ERISA or the Code.   (c) None of the Plans is a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single  ------------------ employer
pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which
the Company could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA
(a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the Plans  ----------------------

or a political subdivision thereof.   (d) None of the Plans provides for
the payment of separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to
any person or obligates the Company to pay separation, severance, termination
or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a "change in control",
within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

event, will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation,

increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Plan or other arrangement,
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding
of any benefits including, but not limited to, the acceleration of
the vesting and exercisability of any Company Option, or (iv) affect in any
material respects any Plan\'s current treatment under any Laws including any
tax or social contribution Law. No Plan provides, or reflects or represents
any liability to provide retiree health to any person for any reason, except
as may be required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and the Company has
never represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form)
to any employee (either individually or to employees as a group) or any other
person that such employee(s) or other person would be provided with retiree
health, except to the extent required by statute.   (e) Each Plan is now
and always has been operated in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, regulations and rules
promulgated thereunder including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The
Company has performed all obligations required to be performed by it under,
is not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and has no
knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Plan. No action,
claim or proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such
action, claim or proceeding. Neither the Company nor any person that is
a member of the same controlled group as the Company or under common control
with the Company within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code (each, an
"ERISA  ----- Affiliate") is subject to any penalty or Tax with respect to
any Plan under --------- Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through
4980 of the Code. Each Plan (other than any stock option plan) can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time,
without material liability to the Parent, Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses). Neither the Company
nor any affiliate has, prior to the Effective Time and in any material
respect, violated any of the health care continuation requirements of COBRA,
the requirements of FMLA, the requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Women\'s
Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns\' and
Mothers\' Health Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such
act, or any similar provisions of state Law applicable to its employees.  
(f) Each Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or Section 401(k) of
the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the
Code   16   has either received a favorable determination, opinion,
notification or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to each such Plan
as to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the
Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, and
no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or
letters from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Plan or the exempt status of any such trust, or has remaining a period of
time under applicable Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such a letter and make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of each such Plan.   (g)
The Company has not incurred any liability under, arising out of or by
operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary
course), including, without limitation, any liability in connection with (i)
the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists which could give rise to
any such liability.   (h) All contributions, premiums or payments required
to be made or accrued with respect to any Plan have been made on or before
their due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for income
tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any
Governmental Entity and no fact or event exists which could give rise to any
such challenge or disallowance.   (i) Except as set forth in Section
3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) the Company is not a party to
any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable
to persons employed by the Company or in the Company\'s business, and

or otherwise failed to comply with the provisions of any collective

Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of
this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub will not, (i) conflict with
or violate their respective charter documents or bylaws, (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions described in
Section 4.04(b) have been obtained and all filings and obligations described

filed with the SEC after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time will be prepared, in all material respects in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated

the Parent SEC Documents contained, nor will any forms, reports, registration
statements, proxy statements, prospectuses or other documents filed after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

operations of Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for
any such changes or effects principally resulting from or principally arising
in connection with (i) any occurrence or condition affecting the market

of itself, any change in the trading price of the Parent Common Stock, or

Entity which could reasonably be expected, if resolved adversely to Parent or
Merger Sub, to (i) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) impair the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or (iii) prevent, delay or make illegal the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To Parent\'s knowledge, no event
has occurred, and no claim, dispute or other condition or circumstance
exists, that could reasonably be expected to give rise to or serve as a basis
of the commencement of any Legal Proceeding of the types described in (i)
through (iii).   SECTION 4.07 Interim Operations of Merger Sub. Merger Sub
was formed by  -------------------------------- Parent solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has

Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their 
----------- affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would
prevent the Merger from constituting   31   a reorganization qualifying

or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   SECTION 4.11 No
Misstatements. No representation or warranty made by Parent 
---------------- or Merger Sub in this Agreement, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule or certificates delivered or deliverable pursuant to the terms
hereof contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or
omits, or will omit, when taken as a whole, to state a material fact,
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger Sub have
disclosed to Company all material information relating to the business of
Parent or Merger Sub or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
would be required to be included in a registration statement of Parent filed

plans and programs maintained by Parent for its and its affiliates\'
employees in the United States. Parent shall provide the Company\'s employees

Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has entered into
an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with John

benefits and payments to the stockholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code, as contemplated in the Proposed Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.   (d) The Company agrees to adopt resolutions to
terminate its 401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan") immediately prior to the

with written notice of such election before the Effective Time. Unless the
Parent provides such notice to the Company, the Parent shall receive from the
Company evidence that the Company\'s Board of Directors has adopted
resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of the Parent), effective
as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.   (e) The Company and,
as applicable, its ERISA Affiliates each agree to terminate any and all group

each ERISA Affiliate have been terminated pursuant to resolution of each such
entity\'s Board of Directors (the form and substance of which resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of the Parent), effective as of the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date but contingent on the Closing.  
38    (f) With respect to all stock purchase, stock option and stock award
agreements (including any restricted stock, stock purchase, stock option or
stock award agreements under the Company Stock Plans) between the Company
and any current or former employee, director, consultant or founder effective

set forth in this Article IX shall be the exclusive remedies of Parent and
the other Parent Indemnified Parties hereunder against any
Company Stockholder; and   (iii) no indemnification payment by the Company
Stockholders with respect to any indemnifiable Loss otherwise payable under
Section 9.02(a) and arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in
Section 9.02(a)(i) shall be payable until such time as all such indemnifiable
Losses shall aggregate to more than $400,000, after which time the Company
Stockholders shall be liable in full for all indemnifiable Losses (including
the first $400,000); provided, however, that the limitations set forth above
in this clause (iii) -------- ------- shall not be operative with respect to
Losses arising from breaches of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 3.13, 3.15, 3.16 and
3.20.   (c) The parties agree that any payment required to be made by
Parent to compensate the Company Stockholders for any Loss incurred by such
Company Stockholder as a result of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of
its representations and warranties in this Agreement shall be paid in
cash; provided, however, that in no event shall cash be paid to the extent
that such -------- ------- payment or portion of such payment, when
aggregated with any other payments made for Losses pursuant to this Article
IX and other non-stock consideration paid to the Company Stockholders
(including, without limitation, cash paid for fractional shares and  
48   Dissenting Shares, if any) would equal or exceed an amount such that
the Parent Common Stock would constitute less than eighty percent (80%) of
total Merger consideration (including payments for Losses pursuant to this
Article IX). Any such excess shall be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock,
which shall be valued by dividing the dollar amount of the Loss by the
average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on The Nasdaq National
Market for the thirty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date
of the determination by a court or arbitrator having competent jurisdiction
over the matters relating to the claim (or the date of the written
instructions or deemed acknowledgment of the claim by Parent, as the case may
be, if no such determination is obtained) as to the amount of any claim for
indemnification.   SECTION 9.03 Indemnification Procedures. (a) For purposes
of this  -------------------------- Section 9.03, a party against which
indemnification may be sought is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party" and
the party which may be entitled to  ------------------ indemnification is
referred to as the "Indemnified Party."  -----------------   (b) The
obligations and liabilities of Indemnifying Parties under this Article IX
with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are
subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article IX ("Third Party
Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following 
------------------ additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party
shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
give all Indemnifying Parties notice of such Third Party Claim within 30 days
of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however,
that the failure to provide  -------- ------- such notice shall not release
an Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification
claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising
therefrom.   (c) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any
Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, and (i) Parent has
reasonably determined that Losses that may be incurred as a result of the
Third Party Claim do not exceed individually, or when aggregated with all
other Losses subject to indemnification under Section 9.02, the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses set forth in such sections, (ii) the
Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction
or other equitable remedy, and (iii) settlement of, or an adverse judgment
with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of
Parent, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the
continuing business interests of Parent or to increase the Tax liability of
Parent or the Company, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and
through counsel of its choice (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to
Parent) if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within 10 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that, if there exists  -------- ------- or is reasonably
likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in
the judgment of the Indemnified Party, in its reasonable discretion, for the
same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own
counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party
determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any
such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided  
49   above, the Indemnifying Party shall conduct the defense of the Third
Party Claim actively and diligently and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s
possession or under the Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying Party\'s possession or under
the Indemnifying Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably requested
by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by any
party conducting the defense against such claim without the prior written
consent of the other party unless the other party and its affiliates
are released in full in connection with such settlement and no admission
of liability is involved; provided, however, if the Company Stockholders are
not entitled to assume the defense against such Third Party Claim pursuant to
this paragraph, the Parent Indemnified Party shall have the right to consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Parent need
not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Company Stockholders or
the Stockholders\' Representative in connection therewith).   SECTION 9.04
Stockholders\' Representative. John Scharber (such person 
---------------------------- and any successor or successors being the
"Stockholders\' Representative") shall  ---------------------------- act as
the representative of the Company Stockholders, and shall be authorized to
act on behalf of the Company Stockholders and to take any and all
actions required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholders\'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, with respect to
any claims (including the settlement thereof) for indemnification from the
Escrow Fund made by Parent pursuant to this Article IX and with respect to
any actions to be taken by the Stockholders\' Representative pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, the exercise of
the power to: authorize delivery to Parent of Escrow Shares in satisfaction
of claims by Parent; agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises, demand arbitration, and comply with orders of courts and awards
of arbitrators with respect to such claims; and take all actions necessary in
the judgment of the Stockholders\' Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing). The Company Stockholders shall be bound by all actions taken
by the Stockholders\' Representative in its capacity thereof, except for any
action that conflicts with the limitations set forth in Section 9.02(b)(ii)
or (iii) or the final sentence of this Section 9.04. The Stockholders\'
Representative shall promptly, and in any event within five business days,
provide written notice to the Company Stockholders of any action taken on

delegated to the Stockholders\' Representative under this Section 9.04. The
Stockholders\' Representative shall at all times act in his or her capacity
as Stockholders\' Representative in a manner that the Stockholders\'
Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Stockholders. Neither the Stockholders\' Representative nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any person
for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to be
taken, under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except in the case of
its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Stockholders\'
Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the  
50   advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The Stockholders\'
Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. As to any matters not expressly
provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders\'
Representative shall not exercise any discretion or take any action. Each
Company Stockholder severally shall indemnify and hold harmless and reimburse
the Stockholders\' Representative from and against such Company
Stockholder\'s ratable share of any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by the Stockholders\'
Representative arising out of or resulting from any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the Stockholders\' Representative under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, other than such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses arising out of or resulting from the
Stockholders\' Representative\'s gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. In all matters relating to claims for indemnification from the
Escrow Fund under this Article IX, the Stockholders\' Representative shall be
the only party entitled to assert the rights of the Company Stockholders, and
the Stockholders\' Representative shall perform all of the obligations of the
Company Stockholders hereunder. Parent shall be entitled to rely on all
statements, representations and decisions of the Stockholders\'
Representative with respect to such claims.   ARTICLE X   GENERAL
