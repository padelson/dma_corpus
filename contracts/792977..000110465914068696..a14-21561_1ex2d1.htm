characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of AMAG

their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning
the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change
after the date of the Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not

Company Stock (other than Treasury Stock) held by such holder, together with a

form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer substantially in the
form of _Exhibit C_ hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and an Investor
Questionnaire and (B) the Buyer shall issue the applicable number of Buyer
Merger Shares to each holder of shares of Company Stock (other than Treasury

completed Letter of Transmittal, an Investor Questionnaire and an executed
counterpart signature page to the Registration Rights/Lock-Up Agreement.
Surrendered certificates shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered
and exchanged, each such certificate shall represent solely the right to
receive the portion of the Merger Consideration into which the shares it
theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.12_
and the rights to receive any payments distributable to the applicable
Stockholder after the Closing Date, if any, pursuant to this Agreement
(including Contingent Payments and payments pursuant to _Section 2.14_,
_Section 2.15_, _Section 7.4_ and _Article XI_) or the Escrow Agreement
and, other than the foregoing, each such Stockholder shall cease to have any
rights with respect to any Company Stock held by such Stockholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the delivery of an affidavit of such fact by
the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the
Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall deliver, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, the portion of the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such
certificate, as contemplated by _Section 2.12_ and the rights to receive any
payments distributable to such Stockholders after the Closing Date, if any,
pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 2.14_, _Section 2.15_,
_Section 7.4_ and _Article XI_) or the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Paying Agent shall notify Buyer before making any such
payment, and Buyer may, in its sole discretion, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver a customary agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.8(d)_ to the contrary, on the
Closing Date, to the extent commercially reasonable, and otherwise as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later than the next
regularly scheduled payroll date), Buyer shall (A) cause to be paid by the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, the Closing Date
Compensatory Payment, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the holders of Company Stock
Options and the holders of Company RSUs who have delivered to the Company
(with a copy to the Paying Agent) an option cancellation agreement in
substantially the form of _Exhibit D_ hereto (an " _Option Cancellation
Agreement_ ") or an RSU cancellation

 



      
 

 



 

agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit E_ hereto (an " _RSU
Cancellation Agreement_ "), as applicable, as well as an Investor
Questionnaire, and (B) issue the applicable number of Buyer Shares to the
holders of Company Stock Options and the holders of Company RSUs who have
delivered to the Company (with a copy to the Paying Agent) an Option
Cancellation Agreement or an RSU Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, as
well as an Investor Questionnaire and an executed counterpart signature page
to the Registration Rights/Lock-Up Agreement. The Buyer shall cause the
payment of the Closing Date Compensatory Payment to be promptly paid on or as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event, no later than
the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing Date or, if
later, the date a signed Option Cancellation Agreement or RSU Cancellation
Agreement is received from the applicable holder), from the relevant accounts
of the Company (or its Subsidiary) through the payroll system of the Company
(or its Subsidiary) to the applicable Person to whom such payments are to be
made, subject to any applicable deductions or withholding Taxes applicable to
such payments to such individuals, which Taxes Buyer shall cause to be
remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority when required. No Merger
Consideration shall be paid with respect to Company Stock Options or Company
RSUs unless and until the holder thereof has delivered a signed Option
Cancellation or RSU Cancellation Agreement to the Company. In the event that a
Fully Diluted Common Holder delivers to either Buyer or Company a completed
and executed Accredited Investor Questionnaire in which such Fully Diluted
Common Holder indicates that he, she or it is a Non-Accredited Investor, then
Buyer or Company (as applicable) shall give prompt written notice thereof to
the other parties.

 



 

(iii) Pending distribution of the Payment Fund pursuant to _Section 2.12(g)_,
the Payment Fund shall be held by the Paying Agent in trust, uninvested in
cash, for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock and the Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purposes.

Milestone Period; _plus_

 



 

(v) a one-time payment of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) (the " _Fifth
Milestone Payment_ ") payable within 30 days of the achievement of an
aggregate amount of Net Sales equal to or greater than $200,000,000 in each of
the five (5) consecutive calendar years from and including the 2015 calendar
year to the 2019 calendar year (regardless of whether any other Contingent
Payments were achieved or made with respect thereto).

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, each of the foregoing First Milestone Payment,
Second Milestone Payment, Third Milestone Payment, Fourth Milestone Payment
and Fifth Milestone Payment shall be payable only once, and no more than one
hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall be payable in any one calendar
year at any time as a result of the conditions to the Contingent Payments
being met and no more than $350,000,000 of Contingent Payments in the
aggregate shall be paid. In the event that the conditions to more than one
Contingent Payment are met in any calendar year, any portion of the total
amount of Contingent Payments due in such calendar year in excess of one
hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall be deferred until the next
calendar year in which less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in
Contingent Payments is due. No Contingent Payments shall be payable with
respect to any period after December 31, 2019 (the " _Contingent Payment
Period End Date_ "); _provided_ that any Contingent Payments that are required
to be paid with respect to any period ending on or prior to the Contingent
Payment Period End Date (or that are deferred pursuant to the preceding
sentence) shall be paid after the Contingent Payment Period End Date.

 



 

(c) _Contingent Payments Not Certain_. Without limiting the provisions of
_Section 5.11_, each of Buyer, the Company and the Stockholders
Representative hereby acknowledges that the amount of sales, if any, that
Buyer and its Subsidiaries may generate is uncertain and that Buyer and its
Subsidiaries may not generate any sales in any calendar year following the
Closing Date, and it is therefore not assured that Buyer will be required to
pay any Contingent Payments, despite Buyers use of commercially reasonable
efforts to sell the Company Product pursuant to _Section 5.18_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Buyer Discretion_. The parties acknowledge that, without limiting the
provisions of _Section 5.11_, (i) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall
have sole discretion over all matters relating to the Company Product and the
Companys business after the Effective Time, including, but not limited to,
any research, development, manufacturing, clinical trial design, site
selection, regulatory, quality standards, legal, Intellectual Property Rights,
marketing, and sales decisions relating to the Companys business and Company
Product, including what efforts to take, if any, with respect to any of such
matters and (ii) the Fully Diluted Common Holders right to receive the
Contingent Payments represents a significant portion of the Fully Diluted
Common Holders consideration for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and is expected to be a significant factor in the Fully Diluted
Common Holders willingness to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger.
The Company acknowledges that, without limiting the provisions of _Section
5.11_, after the Closing, Buyer will operate the Surviving Corporation, and
that neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation owes any fiduciary duty or
express or implied duty to any Fully Diluted Common Holder. By their adoption
of this Agreement, acceptance of any Merger Consideration under this
Agreement, delivery of a Letter of Transmittal or delivery of an Option
Cancellation Agreement or RSU Cancellation Agreement, the Fully Diluted Common
Holders expressly waive the right to pursue any claim against Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation, any of their Affiliates or any other Person under any
implied covenant or implied obligation with respect to such parties efforts
to achieve or pursue any of the milestones set forth in _Section 2.9(b)_, and
agree that the express provisions of this Agreement (including this _Section
2.9_ and _Section 2.10_ and _Section 5.11_), the Letters of Transmittal, the
Option Cancellation Agreement or RSU Cancellation Agreement solely govern
their contractual relationship with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and each
of their Affiliates with respect to the Contingent Payments.

 



 

Section 2.10. _Review Rights; Payment of Contingent Payments; Set-Off_.

 



 

(a) _Review Rights_.

 



 

(i) During the period from and after the Closing and up to and including the
Contingent Payment Period End Date (the " _Contingent Payment Period_ "),
Buyer shall provide the Stockholders Representative, within 45 days following
the end of each calendar quarter, with written reports of Net Sales which
shall include (I) Net Sales, on a country-by-country basis, during such
period, (II) gross sales, on a country-by-country basis, during such period,
and (III) the units of Company Product shipped, on a country-by-country basis,
during such period.

 



 

(ii) Upon the occurrence of Net Sales in an amount sufficient to trigger a
Contingent Payment under _Section 2.9(b)_, Buyer shall provide written notice
to the Stockholders Representative of such occurrence no later than 5
Business Days after Buyer becoming aware of the occurrence thereof (a "
_Contingent Payment Trigger Notice_ "). For purposes of this _Section 2.10_,
Buyer shall be deemed to have come aware of the occurrence of Net Sales in
such amount upon the "close" for Buyers internal financial purposes of the
calendar month in which the amount of Net Sales sufficient to trigger such
Contingent Payment have been achieved. The Contingent Payment Trigger Notice
may be limited to a statement

 



      
 

 



 

that a Contingent Payment has become payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_ and
the applicable amount of such Contingent Payment (but not the underlying
amount of Net Sales); _provided_ that such information regarding such Net
Sales shall be included in the next quarterly report described in _Section
2.10(a)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) Upon the written request of the Stockholders Representative (which
request may not be made more than once in any consecutive twelve month
period), Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit an
independent public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (other
than any firm that is the financial auditor of or providing consulting
services to any Fully Diluted Common Holder that was entitled to receive more
than 10% of the Merger Consideration; _provided_ that the foregoing limitation
will not apply to Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young, KPMG, BDO,
and Grant Thornton) designated by the Stockholders Representative and to be
engaged by the Stockholders Representative and the Buyer pursuant to an
engagement letter reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Representative
and Buyer (a " _Reviewing Accountant_ ") to have reasonable access to the
Books and Records of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours, and subject to the execution of, and
compliance with, a confidentiality agreement mutually reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and such Reviewing Accountant, for the purpose of reviewing the
calculations described in the reports referred to in _Section 2.10(a)(i)_
(including the line-items to show the applicable "gross to net" adjustments).
For the avoidance of doubt, such Reviewing Accountant shall be permitted only
to confirm to the Stockholders Representative the amount of Net Sales for the
periods in question, or report to the Stockholders Representative and Buyer
an alternative calculation of Net Sales. No Reviewing Accountant shall be
permitted to review any Net Sales for any period which have previously been
reviewed by a Reviewing Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.10(a)_. In the
event that the Reviewing Accountant makes a determination that the Net Sales
reported by Buyer for any twelve (12) consecutive month period (or such
shorter period during which the applicable Net Sales are contemplated to have
been achieved) under review are less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Net
Sales as finally determined by the Reviewing Accountant, then Buyer shall pay
all expenses of the Reviewing Accountant. In all other circumstances, all
expenses of the Reviewing Accountant and any out-of-pocket expenses reasonably
and actually incurred by Buyer in connection therewith shall be paid (or
reimbursed) by the Stockholders Representative out of the Reserve Account,
the Indemnity Escrow Account or as a set-off from Contingent Payments pursuant
to _Section 2.10(c)_.

 



 

(iv) The Stockholders Representative agrees that any information delivered to
it under this _Section 2.10(a)_ shall be treated as confidential and may be
"material non-public information" of Buyer for purposes of all securities
Laws, and the Stockholders Representative shall not buy or sell any Buyer
Common Stock based upon any such information in violation of any securities
Laws until such time as such information is disclosed to the public and shall
not disclose

 



       
 

 



 

such information in violation of any securities Laws to any party (except to
the Stockholders Representatives advisors, employees, counsel, accountants
and representatives on a confidential basis, and to the Fully Diluted Common
Holders who have executed Letters of Transmittal, Option Cancellation
Agreements or RSU Cancellation Agreements) until such time as such information
is publicly released by Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Contingent Payments_. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following
the delivery of a Contingent Payment Trigger Notice, Buyer shall deliver the
Contingent Payment to the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent shall distribute
to each of the Fully Diluted Common Holders that portion of the Contingent
Payment for such calendar year allocated to such Fully Diluted Common Holder
pursuant to _Section 2.14(h)_; _provided_ that (i) the aggregate amount of
such Contingent Payment shall be subject to offset in accordance with _Section
2.10(c)_ below, and (ii) any portions of any Contingent Payments payable to
holders of Company Stock Options or Company RSUs who are employees of the
Company at the time of such payment shall be paid through the payroll system
of the Company (or its applicable subsidiary) as provided in _Section
2.8(d)(ii)_.

 



 

(c) _Unilateral Right of Set-Off_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (but subject to the time limitations in _Section 11.5(b)_, as
applicable), the obligation of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation to make any
Contingent Payment shall be qualified in its entirety by the right of Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation to reduce the amount of such Contingent Payment,
to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party determines in good faith that it would
otherwise reasonably be expected to have an indemnification claim pursuant to
(i) _Section 2.14(e)_, (ii) _Section 11.2(a)_ (but only with respect to
Damages relating to breaches of Special Representations), (iii) _Section
11.2(b)_ (but only with respect to Willful Breaches with respect to any
covenants or agreements required to be performed prior to Closing), and (iv)
_Sections 11.2(d)_ through _11.2(f)_ (collectively, " _Set-Off Provisions_
"), by the amount of any Damages reasonably determined by the Buyer in good
faith to have been incurred or suffered and subject to indemnification
pursuant to the Set-Off Provisions, or that could reasonably be expected to be
incurred or suffered, by any Buyer Indemnified Party and subject to
indemnification pursuant to the Set-Off Provisions subject only to the express
limitations on indemnification set forth in _Article XI_ and this _Section
2.10(c)_. Buyer shall provide the Stockholders Representative reasonably
prompt written notice of any Out of Pocket Damages paid by Buyer for which
Buyer intends to exercise its right of setoff pursuant to this _Section
2.10(c)_. In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation exercises its
right of setoff pursuant to this _Section 2.10(c),_ it shall with respect to
any portion of such Damages which are not Out of Pocket Damages and have not
been finally determined (which term, for purposes of this _Section 2.10(c)_,
shall mean a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, a settlement to which the Stockholders Representative has
consented, a full and complete resolution of a Tax Contest in accordance with
_Section 7.3_, or the written mutual agreement between the Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative), place an amount equal to the Buyers or
Surviving Corporations good faith estimate of the maximum amount of such
Damages into a separate escrow account with the Escrow Agent (as defined
below), pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (as defined below),
until the final amount of such Damages is finally determined, at which time an
amount equal to the finally determined amount of such Damages in such escrow
account shall be

 



      
 

 



 

released to Buyer and the remainder of the funds in such escrow account shall
be released to the Stockholders Representative or its designee (for the
benefit of the Fully Diluted Common Holders). In the event that the aggregate
amount set off from a Contingent Payment otherwise payable to the Fully
Diluted Common Holders (or the Paying Agent) pursuant to this _Section
2.10(c)_ with respect to any indemnification claim, is greater than the
aggregate amount of Damages finally determined (after exhausting all available
appeals or other forums for reconsideration) to be payable in respect of such
indemnification claim in accordance with _Article XI_, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall, within ten (10) days after such final
determination of the amount of Damages finally determined (after exhausting
all available appeals or other forums for reconsideration) to be payable in
respect of such indemnification claim in accordance with _Article XI_, pay
the amount of such excess, to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders in cash in accordance with this _Section 2.10_, as a
Contingent Payment. In the event that it is finally determined that any amount
setoff pursuant to this _Section 2.10(c)_ was not reasonably determined by
the Buyer in good faith to have been incurred or suffered pursuant to the Set-
Off Provisions, or that could reasonably be expected to be incurred or
suffered pursuant to the Set-Off Provisions, then the Buyer shall promptly
after such final determination reimburse the Stockholders Representative for
its reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses (including legal fees)
actually incurred in connection with enforcing its rights with respect to any
Litigation regarding such setoff, _provided_ , that in the event that it is
finally determined in any Litigation regarding such setoff that the amount
setoff pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ was reasonably determined by the Buyer
in good faith to have been incurred or suffered and subject to indemnification
pursuant to the Set-Off Provisions, or that could reasonably be expected to be
incurred or suffered and subject to indemnification pursuant to the Set-Off
Provisions, then the Buyer and Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Reserve Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Amount or set-off
of Contingent Payments for their reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses
(including legal fees) incurred in connection such Litigation. No later than
60 days after the expiration of the Contingent Payment Period, the Buyer and
the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to
finally settle all of the remaining amounts that have been set-off pursuant to
this _Section 2.10(c)_ but which have not been finally determined prior to
such date. To the extent that any amounts of any Contingent Payment are set-
off in accordance with this _Section 2.10(c)_, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Fully Diluted
Common Holders. For the avoidance of doubt, once actually paid to the Fully
Diluted Common Holders, the Contingent Payments shall not be recoverable by
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the Set-Off Provisions or
otherwise.

 



 

(d) _Set-Off for Additional Transaction Costs_. Buyer and the Company hereby
acknowledge that the Company has entered into an engagement letter, dated as
of March 6, 2014 (the " _Engagement Letter_ "), with Perella Weinberg Partners
LP (" _Perella_ "), pursuant to which the Company is obligated to make certain
payments in respect of the "Transaction Value" referenced therein upon the
making of the Contingent Payments (the " _Perella Payments_ ").
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, because the amount of
the Perella Payments is unknown as of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
be entitled to reduce the amount of any Contingent Payment, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, by the amount of any Perella Payments it reasonably determines
are payable to Perella after the Effective Time under the Engagement Letter in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with such Contingent Payments, and shall promptly remit the amount
of such Perella Payments to Perella.

 



 

(e) _Appraisal Shares_. The provisions of this _Section 2.10_ also shall
apply to Appraisal Shares that lose their status as such, except that the
obligations of Buyer under this _Section 2.10_ with respect to such Appraisal
Shares shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the
payments to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.14(h)_ hereof had such shares of Company capital stock not been
Appraisal Shares at the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.11. _Form of Consideration Payable by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) _Buyer Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 2.11(c)_, the
number of Buyer Merger Shares which shall be issuable to each of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders at the Closing shall be equal to the aggregate number
of Buyer Merger Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is (x)
the sum of all of the shares of Common Stock (including such shares that are
issuable upon the exercise of all Company Stock Options owned by such Fully
Diluted Common Holder) and Company RSUs in each case that are owned by such
Fully Diluted Common Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the
denominator of which is (y) the sum of all of the shares of Common Stock
(including such shares that are issuable upon the exercise of all Company
Stock Options owned by such Fully Diluted Common Holders) and Company RSUs in
each case that are owned by all Fully Diluted Common Holders immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Buyer Common Stock Issued as Contingent Payment_. Subject to the
provisions of _Section 2.11(c)_ below, upon the mutual agreement in writing
of Buyer and any Fully Diluted Common Holder prior to the making of any
Contingent Payment, Buyer may satisfy all or any part of the portion of such
Contingent Payment to which such Fully Diluted Common Holder is entitled by
the issuance to such Fully Diluted Common Holder of that number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) such amount
of such Contingent Payment that Buyer and such Fully Diluted Common Holder
have agreed shall be satisfied in whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, by (y)
the Reference Market Value on the date of payment, with any fraction of a
share of Buyer Common Stock being treated as provided in _Section 2.11(d)_
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Fully Diluted Common Holder shall be
under any obligation to agree to take any portion of any Contingent Payment in
Buyer Common Stock.

 



 

(c) _Covenants_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall cause the following to
occur:

 



 

(i) any and all shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be saleable, subject to any
restrictions that would be imposed under applicable Law as a result of a Fully
Diluted Common Holders individual circumstance (i.e., any volume limitations
imposed pursuant to Rules 144 or 145 under the Securities Act), without
requiring further registration under the Securities Act, but subject to any
holding period or similar restrictions arising under Rule 144;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall cause any shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to
this Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar
securities, including as to class and series, issued by Buyer are then listed
and, if not so listed, to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, subject only
to notice of issuance; and

 



 

(iii) any and all such shares shall be duly authorized and reserved for
issuance, and upon issuance thereof in accordance with this Agreement, be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
shall be issued, but an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Reference Market
Value on the date hereof of all such fractional shares shall instead be
deposited with the Stockholders Representative by Buyer as additional Reserve
Amount.

 



 

(e) _Legend_. Any certificate issued to any Fully Diluted Common Holders
representing shares of Buyer Common Stock that have not been registered under
the Securities Act shall be imprinted with the following legend (or the
substantial equivalent thereof):

 



 

 ** _"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN WHOLE OR
IN PART, OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER SAID ACT OR IN CONFORMITY
WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF RULE 144 OR OTHER EXEMPTION AS THEN IN EFFECT, WITHOUT
FIRST OBTAINING IF REASONABLY REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY, (I) A WRITTEN OPINION
OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, WHICH MAY BE COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY,
TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONTEMPLATED SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION WILL NOT BE IN
VIOLATION OF SAID ACT, OR (II) A NO-ACTION OR INTERPRETIVE LETTER FROM THE
STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH STAFF
WILL TAKE NO ACTION IN RESPECT OF THE CONTEMPLATED SALE OR OTHER
DISPOSITION."_**

 



 

In the event that any certificate issued to any Fully Diluted Common Holders
representing shares of Buyer Common Stock is imprinted with the foregoing
legend (or a similar legend), Buyer shall cause such legends to be removed in
connection with any resale of such

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Buyer Common Stock that is made in compliance with, or pursuant to a
valid exemption from, the registration provisions of the Securities Act.

 



 

(f) _Registration Rights/Lock-Up Agreement_. At or prior to Closing, Buyer and
the each Fully Diluted Common Holder that will be receiving Buyer Merger
Shares at Closing shall enter into a registration rights and lock-up agreement
in the form of _Exhibit F_ hereto (the " _Registration Rights/Lock-Up
Agreement_ "), it being agreed that no Fully Diluted Common Holder needs to
sign the Registration Rights/Lock-Up Agreement as a condition to Closing and
that Fully Diluted Common Holders may execute a counterpart signature to the
Registration Rights/Lock-Up Agreement (or a joinder thereto) after the
Closing.

 



 

(g) _Reallocation of Buyer Merger Shares and Alternative Per Share Common
Closing Payment_. In connection with soliciting the Stockholder Approval
pursuant to _Section 5.8_, the Company shall deliver to each of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders an "Investor Questionnaire" (the " _Investor
Questionnaires_ ") which shall solicit certain information from such Fully
Diluted Common Holder relative to such persons qualification as an
"accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act (an
" _Accredited Investor_ "). In the event that the Buyer has not been
delivered, on or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, fully-completed and executed Investor Questionnaires from such number of
Fully Diluted Common Holders such that the Buyer may reasonably determine that
the aggregate number of Fully Diluted Common Holders who are not Accredited
Investors is thirty-five (35) or less, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Buyer Merger Shares shall be issued only
to the Accredited Investors, with each of such Accredited Investors being
issued that number of Buyer Merger Shares equal to the product of (A) the
aggregate number of Buyer Merger Shares multiplied by (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is (1) the sum of all of the shares of Common Stock
(including such shares that are issuable upon the exercise of all Company
Stock Options owned by such Fully Diluted Common Holder) and Company RSUs in
each case that are owned by such Fully Diluted Common Holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is (2) the sum of all of
the shares of Common Stock (including such shares that are issuable upon the
exercise of all Company Stock Options owned by such Fully Diluted Common
Holders) and Company RSUs in each case that are owned by all Fully Diluted
Common Holders who are Accredited Investors immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) the Aggregate Common Equity Cash Amount shall be distributed
among the Fully-Diluted Common Holders in accordance with their respective
rights to receive the Alternative Per Share Common Closing Payment; _provided_
, that each of the Fully Diluted Common Holders who are Accredited Investors
shall be deemed to have already received an amount in respect of such payment
equal to the Closing Date Reference Market Value of the Buyer Merger Shares
issuable to such Fully Diluted Common Holders pursuant to this _Section
2.11(g)_, which amounts shall be deemed to be an advance against amounts
otherwise receivable by such Fully Diluted Common Holders in respect of the
Alternative Per Share Common Closing Payment.

 



 

Section 2.12. _Effect on Company Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Buyer, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders, the holders of Company Stock
Options, the holders of Company _RSUs_ , the Stockholders Representative or
the holders of any shares of capital stock of Buyer or Merger Sub:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.12(c)_, all
shares of Company Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (" _Treasury Stock_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without any
conversion thereof or payment therefor.

 



 

(c) _Common Stock_. Subject to the terms of _Section 2.8(d)_, each issued and
outstanding share of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.12(b)_ and other than Appraisal Shares), shall be converted into
and represent the right to receive the Per Share Common Closing Payment (plus
Buyer Merger Shares, as provided in _Section 2.11)_, plus the right to
receive any payments distributable to the holder of such Common Stock after
the Closing Date, if any, pursuant to this Agreement (including Contingent
Payments and payments pursuant to _Section 2.14_, _Section 2.15_, _Section
5.17_, _Section 7.4_ and _Article XI_) or the Escrow Agreement (such
additional payments, the " _Additional Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(d) _Company Stock Options_. Subject to the terms of _Section 2.8(d)_ and
delivery to the Company (with a copy to the Stockholders Representative) of
an Option Cancellation Agreement, and subject to applicable withholding Taxes,
each issued and outstanding Company Stock Option that has not been exercised
by the holder thereof prior to the Effective Time shall, if not vested,
automatically vest, and shall be terminated and converted into and represent
the right to receive, with respect to each share of Common Stock that would
have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option, the Per Share
Common Closing Payment (less the per-share exercise price that would have been
payable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option), (plus Buyer Merger
Shares, as provided in _Section 2.11_), plus the right to receive any
Additional Merger Consideration, subject to any applicable withholding under
applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Company RSUs_. Subject to the terms of _Section 2.8(d)_ and delivery to
the Company (with a copy to the Stockholders Representative) of an RSU
Cancellation Agreement, and subject to applicable withholding Taxes, each
issued and outstanding Company RSU, shall, if not vested, automatically vest,
and shall be terminated and converted into and represent the right to receive,
with respect to each share of Common Stock subject to such RSU, the Per Share
Common Closing Payment (plus Buyer Merger Shares, as provided in _Section
2.11_), plus the right to receive any Additional Merger Consideration, subject
to any applicable withholding under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _No Further Rights_. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock, Company
Stock Options and Company RSUs shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of any shares of Common Stock, Company Stock Options, or Company RSUs
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the respective consideration provided for in this _Section 2.12_ and
the right to receive any Additional Merger Consideration. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer
of any Company Stock shall be made thereafter. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates or any other evidence of any Company Stock are presented

 



      
 

 



 

to the Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the respective
consideration provided for in this _Section 2.12_ by the Paying Agent and the
rights to receive any Additional Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Article II_, none of the Paying Agent,
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Stockholders Representative, any Stockholder, any holder of
Company Stock Options or any holder of Company RSUs shall be liable to any
Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
or its designee any funds (including any earnings received with respect
thereto) remaining in the Payment Fund or certificates for shares of Buyer
Common Stock that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have
not been disbursed to the Fully Diluted Common Holders, and thereafter such
Fully Diluted Common Holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Stockholders Representative or such designee (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof solely
with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable to them, without
any interest thereon.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Stockholders Representative, the Paying Agent and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making
of such payment in accordance with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, other than with respect to any Compensatory Payment (including any
Closing Date Compensatory Payments), Buyer shall provide notice of any
intention to so deduct and withhold, and a description of the legal basis
therefor, in writing to the Stockholders Representative on or prior to the
third Business Day prior to the date on which such consideration is to be
paid. To the extent that any such amounts are so deducted and withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any amounts are required to be
so withheld from any distributions from the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
Indemnity Escrow Amount or Appraisal Escrow Amount, such amounts required to
be so withheld shall, at the sole option of Buyer, be distributed to Buyer (or
an entity designated by Buyer) to enable Buyer (or any such designated entity)
to comply with its withholding obligations (including without limitation, any
obligations of the Company or Surviving Corporation) or paid by the Escrow
Agent directly to the appropriate Taxing Authority.

 



 

Section 2.13. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Common Stock (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.12(c)_ and the rights to receive any Additional Merger
Consideration, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that

 



      
 

 



 

if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the appraisal rights of
such holder shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
upon surrender of the certificates (or lost stock affidavits with respect
thereto) representing such Appraisal Shares in accordance with _Section
2.8(d)_, the portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.12(c)_ and the rights to receive any Additional Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.14. _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholders Representative a statement
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Net Working Capital, the Net
Funded Indebtedness, the Transaction Related Expenses (to the extent not paid
by the Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing) (except for any
such Transaction Related Expenses reimbursable by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement (including _Section 5.2_ and _Section 12.7_)), the Excess Load-In
Charge, and the components thereof. The Closing Statement and the Net Working
Capital, the Net Funded Indebtedness, Transaction Related Expenses (to the
extent not paid by the Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing)
(except for any such Transaction Related Expenses reimbursable by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 5.2_ and _Section 12.7_)) and
Excess Load-In Charge set forth therein shall be prepared and calculated in
good faith, and in the manner and on a basis consistent with the applicable
definitions thereof and shall be in the same form and include the same line
items as the Estimated Net Working Capital calculation, the Estimated Net
Funded Indebtedness calculation, the Estimated Transaction Related Expenses
calculation and the Estimated Excess Load-In Charge calculation. If the
Closing Statement is not so timely delivered, the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Related
Expenses and Estimated Excess Load-In Charge will be deemed Final Net Working
Capital, Final Net Funded Indebtedness, Final Transaction Related Expenses,
and Final Excess Load-In Charge respectively, absent manifest error or fraud.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Stockholders Representative
will have sixty (60) calendar days to review the Closing Statement. Unless the
Stockholders Representative delivers written notice (which notice shall
include the items and amounts in dispute and supporting documentation related
thereto; such notice, a " _Seller Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth in
reasonable detail the specific items disputed by the Stockholders
Representative in good faith with respect thereto, and the specific basis for
each such objection, on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) calendar day after the
Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Stockholders Representative will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the
Closing Statement and such statement (and the calculations contained therein)
will be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or fraud. If the
Stockholders Representative delivers to Buyer a Seller Dispute Notice within
such sixty (60) calendar day period, Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative shall, during the thirty (30) calendar days following delivery
of such Seller Dispute Notice by the Stockholders Representative to Buyer (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing) (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to
the disputed items (or calculations) in such Seller Dispute Notice (the "
_Disputed Items_ "), and all other items (and all calculations

 



      
 

 



 

relating thereto) will be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error
or fraud. Any resolution by Buyer and the Stockholders Representative during
the Resolution Period as to any Disputed Item shall be set forth in writing
and will be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or fraud.

 



 

(c) If Buyer and the Stockholders Representative do not resolve all Disputed
Items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining
in dispute will be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator pursuant to an
engagement letter reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Representative
and the Buyer. The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine
only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute, consistent with this _Section
2.14_, and shall request a statement from Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative regarding such Disputed Items. The scope of the disputes to be
arbitrated by the Neutral Arbitrator is limited to those items or calculations
specifically in dispute between Buyer and the Stockholders Representative;
and the Neutral Arbitrator is not to make any other determination, including
not making any determination as to whether the Closing Statement or Net
Working Capital, Net Funded Indebtedness, Transaction Related Expenses or
Excess Load-In Charge was prepared in accordance with GAAP or whether the
agreed upon dollar amount of the Target Net Working Capital is correct or
appropriate or in accordance with GAAP or the definition of Net Working
Capital. In resolving each Disputed Item, the Neutral Arbitrator shall be
bound by the principles set forth in this _Section 2.14_ and may not assign a
value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed
Item claimed by any party or less than the lowest value for such Disputed Item
claimed by any party. The parties further agree that the adjustment
contemplated by this _Section 2.14_ is intended to show the change between
the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Final Net Working Capital, the
change between the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness and the Final Net Funded
Indebtedness, the change between Estimated Transaction Related Expenses and
Final Transaction Related Expenses, and the change between Estimated Excess
Load-In Charge and Final Excess Load-In Charge, and that such changes can only
be measured if each calculation is done in a manner consistent with the
applicable definitions thereof. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator will be allocated between Buyer
and the Stockholders Representative (which, in the case of the Stockholders
Representative, shall be payable by the Stockholders Representative solely
out of the Reserve Amount, or by setoff against one or more Contingent
Payments) in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the Disputed
Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed
by each such party (as finally determined by the Neutral Arbitrator) bears to
the total amount of such Disputed Items so submitted. The Neutral Arbitrator
will deliver to Buyer and the Stockholders Representative a written
determination (such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based
solely on information provided to the Neutral Arbitrator by the Stockholders
Representative and Buyer, and a written explanation in reasonable detail of
each such determination) of the Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral
Arbitrator within thirty (30) calendar days, or such longer period as may be
required by the Neutral Arbitrator, of receipt of such Disputed Items, which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or
fraud. The final, binding and conclusive Closing Statement based either upon
agreement by the parties, or deemed agreement by Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative in accordance with this _Section 2.14_, or the written
determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this
_Section 2.14(c)_ will be the " _Conclusive Closing Statement_."

 



      
 

 



 

Neither any Stockholder, holder of Company Stock Options, holder of Company
RSUs nor the Stockholders Representative shall have any liability with
respect to Funded Indebtedness, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Transaction
Related Expenses, or current assets or current liabilities (including as to
accounts receivable and the collectability thereof) or any other component of
Net Working Capital except as determined in this _Section 2.14_, except that
this sentence shall not limit a claim for a breach of a representation or
warranty pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ (but for the avoidance of doubt any
liability under _Section 2.14_ or Damages under _Section 11.2(a)_ may not be
recovered more than once in respect of the same liability or Damages, as the
case may be). All negotiations pursuant to this _Section 2.14(c)_ shall be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable other laws including state rules
of evidence, and all negotiations, submissions to the Neutral Arbitrator, and
dispute resolution proceedings under this _Section 2.14(c)_ shall be treated
as such. The Neutral Arbitrator shall be bound by a mutually agreeable
confidentiality confidential information agreement. The procedures of this
_Section 2.14(c)_ are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the
determination of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the
parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this _Section 2.14(c)_ may be
filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may
seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any
decision under this _Section 2.14(c)_. The other partys only defense to such
a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be manifest
error or fraud by or upon the Neutral Arbitrator. Absent such manifest error
or fraud, such other party shall reimburse the party seeking enforcement for
its expenses related to such enforcement.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 2.14(e)_:

 



 

(i) if the Aggregate Common Equity Cash Amount is greater than the Final
Payment Amount, then the Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay to the Surviving Corporation, solely out of the funds
in the Adjustment Escrow Account, an amount in cash equal to the amount by
which the Aggregate Common Equity Cash Amount is greater than the Final
Payment Amount; _provided_ that, if such amount exceeds the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account by greater than $500,000, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to recover such amount either from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, or by way of offset against any Contingent Payments pursuant to
_Section 2.10(c)_; and

 



 

(ii) if the Aggregate Common Equity Cash Amount is less than the Final Payment
Amount, Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent (for further pro rata distribution
to the Fully Diluted Common Holders, as set forth in _Section 2.8_) an amount
in cash equal to the amount by which the Aggregate Common Equity Cash Amount
is less than the Final Payment Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (the amount payable to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.14(d)(i)_
and the amount payable to the Paying Agent (for further pro rata distribution
to the Fully Diluted Common Holders) pursuant to this _Section 2.14(d)(ii)_
are referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer shall cause any such payment that is a
Compensatory Payment to be promptly paid from the relevant accounts of the

 



       
 

 



 

Company (or its Subsidiary) through the payroll system of the Company (or its
Subsidiary) to the applicable Person to whom such payments are to be made,
subject to any applicable deductions or withholding Taxes applicable to such
payments.

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 2.14_:

 



 

(A) the " _Final Payment Amount_ " shall be an amount in Dollars equal to (i)
the Base Enterprise Value, _plus_ (ii) the Final Net Working Capital Excess
Amount, if any, _minus_ (iii) the Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount,
if any, _minus_ (iv) the Final Net Funded Indebtedness (for the avoidance of
doubt, if Final Net Funded Indebtedness is a negative number, the Final
Payment Amount will increase), _minus_ (v) the Final Transaction Related
Expenses, _minus_ (vi) the Final Excess Load-In Charge, _minus_ (vii) the
Escrow Amount, _minus_ (viii) the Reserve Amount;

 



 

(B) the " _Final Net Working Capital Excess Amount_ " shall be the amount, if
any, by which Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.14_ is greater than the Target Net Working Capital;

 



 

(C) the " _Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount_ " shall be the amount,
if any, by which Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.14_ is less than the Target Net Working Capital;

 



 

(D) the " _Final Net Funded Indebtedness_ " shall be the Net Funded
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.14_;

 



 

(E) the " _Final Transaction Related Expenses_ " shall be the Transaction
Related Expenses (to the extent not paid by the Company or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing) (except for any such Transaction Related
Expenses reimbursable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section
5.2_ and _Section 12.7_)) as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.14_; and

 



 

(F) the " _Final Excess Load-In Charge_ " shall be the amount, if any, by
which the Excess Load-In Charge as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.14_ is greater than the Estimated Excess Load-In Charge.

 



 

(e) If, after receipt of the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.14(a)_:

 



 

(i) the Stockholders Representative does not deliver a Seller Dispute Notice
as described in _Section 2.14(b)_ within the sixty (60) day period following
the Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement or if
within such period the Stockholders Representative delivers a notice to Buyer
stating that the Stockholders Representative does not dispute any item in the
Closing Statement (such notice, a " _Non-Dispute Notice_ "), then on the fifth
(5th) Business Day following the earlier of the last day of such sixty (60)
day period or on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which
Buyer receives such Non-

 



      
 

 



 

Dispute Notice, as applicable, the payments set forth in _Section 2.14(d)_
shall be made;

 



 

(ii) the Stockholders Representative delivers a Seller Dispute Notice as
described in _Section 2.14(b)_ within the sixty (60) day period following the
Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, then on the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which Buyer receives such
notice of dispute, the payments set forth in _Section 2.14(d)_ shall be made,
if any, in respect of such Closing Statement that is not subject to dispute,
_provided_ , however, that in no event shall any payment be made out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section 2.14(e)(ii)_ to the
extent that such payment would result in the remaining funds in the Adjustment
Escrow Account being less than the aggregate amount which would be
distributable to the Buyer out of the Adjustment Escrow Account assuming all
of the Disputed Items were resolved completely in favor of the Buyers
position with respect to such Disputed Items; and

 



 

(iii) with respect to any Disputed Item, within five (5) Business Days after
resolution or deemed resolution of such Disputed Item in accordance with
_Section 2.14_ (whether by mutual agreement between Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative, or by decision of the Neutral Arbitrator), Buyer
or the Stockholders Representative, as applicable, shall pay, or direct the
Escrow Agent to pay, as applicable, the other party such Disputed Item (or
portion thereof) pursuant to the resolution of such Disputed Item (or portion
thereof) in favor of such other party, as applicable, in accordance with this
_Section 2.14_, _provided_ , however, that in no event shall any payment be
made out of the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section
2.14(e)(iii)_ to the extent that such payment would result in the remaining
funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account being less than the aggregate amount
which would be distributable to the Buyer out of the Adjustment Escrow Account
assuming all of the Disputed Items were resolved completely in favor of the
Buyers position with respect to such Disputed Items.

 



 

(f) Buyer acknowledges that, absent manifest error or fraud and subject to the
provisions of this _Section 2.14(f)_, the sole and exclusive remedy of
itself, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to receive payments owed to
it under this _Section 2.14_ shall be recovery from the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, Indemnity Escrow Account and Contingent Payment
offset rights, as set forth in _Section 2.14(d)(i)_ above, and that the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall not
be available to satisfy any other claim or obligation hereunder. In the event
that (i) the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, (ii) the funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and (iii) the Contingent Payment offset rights, as
set forth in _Section 2.14(d)(i)_, are insufficient to pay to the Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub or Buyer any amounts owed to it pursuant to this
_Section 2.14_, absent manifest error or fraud, neither Buyer, Merger Sub nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to collect any remaining amounts
not satisfied from the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Indemnity
Escrow Account or the Contingent Payment offset rights, as set forth in
_Section 2.14(d)(i)_, and neither the Stockholders Representative, any of
the other Stockholders, holders of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Stock Options or holders of Company RSUs, nor any other Person shall have any
liability for any such deficiency.

 



 

(g) After the Closing and until the Net Working Capital, the Net Funded
Indebtedness, the Transaction Related Expenses, and the Excess Load-In Charge
have been determined to be final in accordance with this _Section 2.14_,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries to, provide to the Stockholders Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access to the Books and Records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to any other information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), including work
papers of their respective accountants (to the extent permitted by such
accountants), and to any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries premises during
regular business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the extent
necessary for the Stockholders Representative to review all or any part of
the Closing Statement, and to prepare materials for presentation to the
Neutral Arbitrator in connection with this _Section 2.14_; _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not require the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to disclose any privileged information to the extent it would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of attorney-client privilege with
respect to any material information.

 



 

(h) With respect to any payments to be made to Fully Diluted Common Holders
following the Closing Date, including any Contingent Payments and any payments
pursuant to this _Section 2.14_ or _Section 2.15_ or the Escrow Agreement,
the Paying Agent shall cause such payments to be made to all Fully Diluted
Common Holders on a pro rata basis, with each Fully Diluted Common Holder
deemed to hold such portion of the Fully Diluted Share Number represented by
the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock held by it as of
immediately prior to Closing, (y) the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option held by it as of
immediately prior to Closing (assuming the payment of the exercise price in
cash) and (z) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each Company RSU
held by it as of immediately prior to Closing; _provided_ , however, Buyer
shall cause any such payment that is a Compensatory Payment to be promptly
paid from the relevant accounts of the Company (or its Subsidiary) through the
payroll system of the Company (or its Subsidiary) to the applicable Person to
whom such payments are to be made, subject to any applicable deductions or
withholding Taxes applicable to compensatory payments to such individuals,
which Taxes Buyer shall cause to be remitted to the appropriate Taxing
Authority when required.

 



 

Section 2.15. _Escrow Amounts_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit (i) seven
million Dollars ($7,000,000) (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") into an
escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), (ii) Thirty Five Million
Dollars ($35,000,000) (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow
account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), and (iii) in the event there are
any Appraisal Shares, an amount equal to the Appraisal Shares Escrow Amount
into an escrow account (the " _Appraisal Shares Escrow Account_ "), in each
case, to be established with Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ")
to be held by the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement
substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_, with such customary changes thereto
as requested by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent until the final determination
of the Final Payment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.14_ to serve as the sole
source of payment for any amount

 



      
 

 



 

due to Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation for any adjustment to
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.14_, at which time the Escrow
Agent shall automatically distribute to the Stockholders Representative or
its designee (for the benefit of the Fully Diluted Common Holders) in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement all
amounts then remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account, if any; _provided_ ,
however, that, if on such date any Disputed Items exist, an amount of such
funds equal to the maximum amount that would be distributable to Buyer if all
of such Disputed Items were resolved in favor of the Buyers position on such
Disputed Items shall not be released from the Adjustment Escrow Account until
the final determination or agreement of the Conclusive Closing Statement; _
provided_, further, that, in the sole discretion of the Stockholders
Representative, up to $2,500,000 of the amounts distributable to the Paying
Agent, the Stockholders Representative or its designee pursuant to this
sentence may be retained by the Stockholders Representative to increase the
Reserve Amount instead of distributing such amount to the Fully Diluted Common
Holders. The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent until
the earlier of (i) March 15, 2016 and (ii) five (5) days after the date on
which the Buyers audited financial statements for its fiscal year ending
December 31, 2015, are filed with the SEC (the " _Survival Date_ "), at which
time the Escrow Agent shall automatically distribute to the Paying Agent (for
the benefit of the Fully Diluted Common Holders) in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement all amounts then remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if on such
date any claims for indemnification under _Article XI_ are outstanding, an
amount of such funds equal to the amount of such claims shall not be released
from the Indemnity Escrow Account until such claims have been finally
resolved; _provided_ , further, that, in the sole discretion of the
Stockholders Representative, up to $2,500,000 of the amounts distributable to
the Paying Agent, the Stockholders Representative or its designee pursuant to
this sentence may be retained by the Stockholders Representative to increase
the Reserve Amount instead of distributing such amount to the Fully Diluted
Common Holders. The Appraisal Shares Escrow Amount, if any, shall be held by
the Escrow Agent until all Appraisal Claims have been finally resolved, at
which time the Escrow Agent shall automatically distribute to the Paying Agent
(for the benefit of the Fully Diluted Common Holders) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Agreement an amount equal to
(i) the remaining amount of funds in the Appraisal Shares Escrow Account,
_minus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of any claims for Damages made or submitted
by an Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.2(c)_ that remain
unpaid or unsatisfied as of such date in accordance with _Article XI_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that as such claims are resolved, any amounts
previously retained but not paid to satisfy such claim shall, at the time of
such resolution, be distributed by the Escrow Agent from the Appraisal Shares
Escrow Account to the Paying Agent in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall cause any payment from the Escrow
Account which is a Compensatory Payment (plus any Company Payroll Taxes
associated therewith) to be transferred to the Company (or a Subsidiary of the
Company) and then Buyer shall cause such amount to be promptly paid from the
relevant accounts of the Company (or its Subsidiary) through the payroll
system of the Company (or its Subsidiary) to the applicable Person to whom
such payments are to be made, subject to any applicable deductions or
withholding Taxes applicable to Compensatory Payments to such individuals,
which Taxes Buyer shall cause to be remitted to the appropriate Taxing
Authority when required. The fees and disbursements of the Escrow Agent
incurred pursuant to the transactions contemplated by

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be borne equally by Buyer and
the Stockholders Representative (which, in the case of the Stockholders
Representative, shall be payable by the Stockholders Representative solely
out of the Reserve Amount).

approvals, waivers or authorizations of which the failure to obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses and assets, taken
as a whole.

 



 

Section 3.5. _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and performance by

or the lapse of time or both) of any material right or obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or result in a loss of any benefit
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under, any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or result
in the creation of any Lien upon any assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (c) assuming the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals and Non-
Governmental Consents, violate or result in a breach of or constitute a
default under any Law or Governmental Authorization to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject, other than, in the case of clauses _(b)_
and _(c)_ , conflicts, breaches, terminations, defaults, cancellations,
accelerations, losses, violations or Liens that would not,

delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under, any Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (c)
assuming the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals and Non-Governmental
Consents, violate or result in a breach of or constitute a default under any
Law or Governmental Authorization to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject, other than, in the case of clauses (b) and (c),
conflicts, breaches, terminations, defaults, cancellations, accelerations,
losses, violations or Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses and assets, taken as a whole. As of the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of
any default or threat thereof, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has a reasonable basis for suspecting that any such default
exists or will be forthcoming. The Womens Health APA sets forth the entire
agreement, together with the agreements referred to therein, between the
Company and the Womens Health Buyer regarding the sale of the Womens Health
Division and is not, and has not been, modified by any other agreement as of
the date hereof, except as set forth therein.

holder of Company Stock Options or holder of Company RSUs, the Stockholders
Representative nor the Company makes any representation or warranty, express
or implied, at Law or in equity, with respect to itself, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their other Affiliates, or any of their respective
assets, liabilities, businesses or operations (including in respect of the
correctness, accuracy or completeness of any Contract or certificate furnished

warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed.

Section 4.10. _Financing_. Attached as Appendix A sets forth a true, correct
and complete copy of the executed Commitment Letter from the financing sources
set forth therein (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "; _provided_ , that for
purposes of this Agreement, references to the Lenders also shall include,
after the date hereof, to the extent alternative debt financing from
alternative financial institutions is obtained in accordance with this
Agreement, all such alternative financial institutions), together with the
executed fee letters referenced in the Commitment Letter (except that the
fees, pricing and other economic terms set forth therein have been redacted)
(the " _Fee Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts
set forth therein to the Buyer for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Financing_ "; _provided_ , that for
purposes of this Agreement, references to the Financing also shall include,
after the date hereof, to the extent alternative debt financing from
alternative financial institutions is obtained in accordance with this
Agreement, any such alternative debt financing). There are no conditions
precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing in accordance
with the terms of the Commitment Letter, other than as set forth therein and
in the Fee Letter (including any "flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or
modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or
modification is contemplated by the Company (other than amendments or
modifications solely to add additional financing sources). The Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer and, to Buyers knowledge, the other parties thereto (except in each
case as may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, or moratorium Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies). Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub is
party to any other agreements, side letters, or arrangements with the
Financing Sources relating to the Commitment Letter (other than the Fee
Letter, including any "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) that
could reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Financing.
Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties in this
Agreement and the performance by the Company of its respective obligations in
this Agreement, to Buyers Knowledge as of the date hereof, there are no facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied, or the
Financing not being available to Buyer or Merger Sub, on the date of the
Closing. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid under the Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy of the
Companys representations and warranties in this Agreement and the performance
by the Company and the Stockholders Representative of its respective
obligations in this Agreement, when funded in accordance with their terms (in
the case of the Financing, at the maximum amount of the term loan facility
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and in the Fee Letter (including any
"flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter)) the net proceeds to be
disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
together with cash-on-hand of Buyer, are sufficient to enable Buyer and Merger
Sub to pay and satisfy all of their cash payment obligations as of the Closing
Date under this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements (including (A)
the amounts necessary to satisfy all obligations under _Article II_ due on
the Closing Date and (B) any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Buyer or Merger Sub on the Closing Date in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and the Financing). No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would

 



       
 

 



 

constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub under any
condition or material term of the Commitment Letter, and to Buyers Knowledge,
assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties in this
Agreement and the performance by the Company and the Stockholders
Representative of their respective obligations in this Agreement, Buyer will
not be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition or material term to
be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letter.

 



 

Section 4.11. _Solvency_. Assuming all of the representations and warranties
in _Article III_ are accurate, immediately after giving effect to the Closing
(and any transactions related thereto or incurred in connection therewith),
each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving
Corporation shall be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and
shall own property which has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts
required to pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities). Assuming all of the representations and
warranties in _Article III_ are accurate, immediately after giving effect to
the Closing (and any transactions related thereto or incurred in connection
therewith), each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of
the Surviving Corporation shall have adequate capital to carry on their
respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation
is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 4.12. _Buyer SEC Reports; Information Statement_.

 



 

(a) Buyer has timely filed all reports, registration statements, proxy
statements and other materials, together with any amendments required to be
made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with the SEC since
June 30, 2013, and all such reports, registration statements, proxy
statements, other materials and amendments have complied in all material
respects with all legal requirements relating thereto.

 



 

(b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Buyer or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) any
information statement (an " _Information Statement_ ") with respect to the
Buyer Common Stock to be issued to the Fully Diluted Common Holders at the
Closing will, at the time such Information Statement is distributed to the
Fully Diluted Common Holders, and at any time it is amended or supplemented,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading (except that no representation or warranty is made by Buyer or
Merger Sub regarding such portions thereof that relate expressly to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to statements made therein to the extent
based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein).

 



 

Section 4.13. _Limitations on Representations and Warranties_. Except as
expressly set forth in this _Article IV_ or in the officers certificate
delivered to the Stockholders Representative pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_,
neither Buyer nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty, express or
implied, at Law or in equity, with respect to itself or any of its respective
Affiliates, or any of their respective assets, liabilities, businesses or
operations (including in respect of the

 



      
 

 



 

correctness, accuracy or completeness of any Contract or certificate furnished
or made available, or to be furnished or made available, or statement made, by
Buyer, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated herein), and
any such other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed.

Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Closing Date and, during such period, the Company shall
make available promptly to Buyer all information concerning the businesses,
affairs, operations, properties and personnel of the Company and its

written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to those
managers, officers, directors, employees, agents, accountants and counsel of
the Company who have any knowledge relating to the Company or the business of
the Company, and a reasonable opportunity to make such investigations as Buyer
and such officers and authorized representatives reasonably request,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not require the Company or its Affiliates
(i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or the applicable Affiliate would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality, (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Affiliates to the extent it would reasonably be expected
to cause the loss of attorney-client privilege on any material information, or
(iii) to permit any environmental sampling, testing or other intrusive
investigations of the Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any of the
Fully Diluted Common Holders (including the Stockholders Representative) make
any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any)
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.1_, and Buyer may not rely on the
accuracy of any such information, in each case except to the extent expressly
set forth in the Companys representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_.

 



 

(b) Any such investigation by Buyer or Merger Sub shall not unreasonably
interfere with any of the businesses or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub shall, prior to the Closing Date,
have any contact whatsoever with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any agent, broker, partner, lender, lessor, vendor, customer,
supplier, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except in consultation with the Company and then only with the express prior
approval of the Company, which approval shall be granted pursuant to the terms

be unreasonably withheld. All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section 5.1_ shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company in a
notice given to Buyer, and all such information shall be governed by the terms
of _Section 5.4_ and the Confidentiality Agreement.

(a) The Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and to cooperate in obtaining any

the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Buyer,
Merger Sub and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in

commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other party in such
other partys efforts to obtain any Non-Governmental Consents as are required

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including

statements, applications or other filings made by or on behalf of Buyer, or
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements or the Womens Health APA; _provided_ that any such
documentation furnished by the parties to one another may be redacted to the
extent necessary, either to comply with applicable Law or to protect the
confidentiality of information that if furnished would not materially
facilitate the other partys understanding of the status of matters relating
to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Buyer, Merger Sub, and the Company each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated

the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Buyer,
Merger Sub, or the Company, as the case

Health APA or notices or other communications received by third parties that
could potentially lead to delay or impediments to Closing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the Womens
Health APA; _provided_ that any such notices furnished by the parties to one
another may be redacted to the extent necessary, either to comply with
applicable Law or to protect the confidentiality of information that if
furnished would not materially facilitate the other partys understanding of
the status of matters relating to consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, or the Company shall permit
any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Entity with respect to any filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat.

 



 

(e) Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from any
Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any Governmental Entity and shall
cooperate with each other party hereto in connection therewith, and (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent

the Stockholders or any other Person shall have any liability to Buyer arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain (and no amounts may be recovered
from the Indemnity Escrow Account or set-off pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_ in
respect of such failure) any Non-Governmental Consents that may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or because of the termination of any Contract solely as a
result thereof; _provided_ that this _Section 5.2(g)_ shall not eliminate,
reduce or modify in any respect the liability of such Persons due to any
breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
Company or the Stockholders Representative hereunder.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with the
exercise of any commercially reasonable efforts, reasonable best efforts or
other standard of conduct pursuant to this Agreement, neither the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, the Stockholders Representative, nor any Fully Diluted
Common Holder (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall be required, in
respect of any provision of this Agreement, to (A) pay any fees, expenses or
other amounts to any Governmental Entity or any party to any Contract
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary course fees and expenses of
their respective attorneys and advisors, and the payment of administrative or
processing fees, and any payments required to be made pursuant to the express
terms of such Contracts), or (B) take any action that would result in a
material adverse change in the benefits to any such Person under this
Agreement or the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby, to make any changes to any of their
respective businesses, to commence any Litigation or to incur any other
material Liability.

Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to,
and within the control of, Buyer, Merger Sub or their Representatives in the

neither Buyer nor Merger Sub shall amend, modify or waive, or agree to amend,
modify or waive, the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter in any manner that
would impose any new or additional material conditions to, or reasonably be
expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent, the funding of the
Financing at the Closing, or otherwise prevent or materially delay or
materially impair the funding of the Financing; it being understood and
agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that Buyer and Merger Sub shall have the
right, from time to time, to amend, replace, supplement, or otherwise modify
or waive any provision of the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, and/or
substitute other debt financing for all or a portion of the Financing from the
same and/or alternative financing sources, as long as such amendments,
replacements, supplements or modifications or waivers, or such substitute
financing, shall not expand, add or increase the conditions precedent
contained therein, decrease the amount of financing contemplated therein or
delay the funding of the Financing.

 



 

(iii) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter so as not to enable Buyer and
Merger Sub to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely
manner, each of Buyer and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms not materially less favorable to Buyer and Merger Sub, taken as a
whole, than the terms in the Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the
obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition
to Closing and, subject

 



      
 

 



 

to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in _Article VIII_, reaffirms
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative financing. Buyer shall furnish the Stockholders Representative
with complete, correct and executed copies of any alternative financing
commitment letters promptly upon their execution. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall give the Stockholders Representative prompt written notice of any
material breach, to Buyers Knowledge, by any party to the Commitment Letter
or any termination of the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall keep the
Stockholders Representative reasonably informed following the request of the
Stockholders Representative of the status of Buyers and Merger Subs efforts
to arrange or obtain the Financing.

 



 

(iv) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
respective officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting,
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide ( _provided_ that any such
cooperation or action shall be reasonably requested and shall not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives) to Buyer and/or Merger Sub, at Buyers sole
expense, such reasonable cooperation in connection with the obtaining and
arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer,
including, but not limited to, using commercially reasonable efforts to: (A)
(1) assist in preparation for and participate in marketing efforts, including
lender meetings (but not more than one (1) primary bank meeting and only a
reasonable number of "one on one" meetings), due diligence meetings, road
shows, presentations and sessions with rating agencies, the Lenders, and any
prospective lenders in the Financing (including reasonable direct contact
between senior management and Representatives (including non-legal advisors)
of the Company), (2) ensure that any syndication efforts benefit from the
Companys existing lending and investment banking relationships, to the extent
reasonably practical and appropriate, (3) assist with the drafting and
preparation of appropriate and customary confidential information memoranda,
business projections and other customary marketing documents required in
connection with the syndication of the Financing, including without
limitation, to the extent commercially reasonable to do so, versions of such

material with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
purposes of United States federal and state securities Laws (all such
documents and materials, collectively the " _Syndication Documents_ ") and (4)
cause the chief financial officer or person performing similar functions of
the Company to execute and deliver customary authorization and customary
representation and warranty letters with respect to the Syndication Documents,
_provided_ , that the Company will provide to Buyer and the Lenders such
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be necessary so
that the Syndication Documents are, solely with respect to such information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, complete and correct in all
material respects and does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact

 



      
 

 



 

or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements are
made, not misleading; (B) facilitate the providing of guarantees and granting
of security interests (and perfection thereof) in and pledges of collateral
(including delivery of stock certificates of the Company and its subsidiaries)
and assist in the preparation, and executing and delivery at the Closing, of
any Debt Financing Documents and any closing documents and deliverables
(including furnishing all information to be included in any schedules thereto
or in any perfection certificates and arranging for delivery of insurance
certificates) for the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer,
_provided_ , that no such Debt Financing Documents or closing documents and
deliverables referred to in this clause (B) shall be effective until the
Closing; (C) arrange for delivery of the Payoff Letters and for the
termination of all Liens on the assets and stock of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than Permitted Liens); (D) solely related to the Company
and its Affiliates, furnish all documentation and other information to the
Lenders reasonably requested or required by governmental or regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer", anti-money laundering,
anti-terrorism, foreign corrupt practices and similar laws, rules and
regulations of all applicable jurisdictions related to the Financing; and (E)
furnish Buyer or Merger Sub reasonably promptly with (1) the Required
Financial Information and (2) such other financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer and that is customarily needed for financings of the type
contemplated by the Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, cooperation under this _Section 5.2(i)_ that: (I) unreasonably
interferes with the ongoing business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (II) requires the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers, managers or employees to execute, deliver or
enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any
Debt Financing Document, with respect to the Financing that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than
the above referenced Syndication Documents and authorization and
representation letters) and the directors and managers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Financing is
obtained, in each case which are effective prior to the Closing. In no event
shall the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company be required to pay any
commitment or similar fee in connection with assisting Buyer and/or Merger Sub
in arranging the Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
any of its respective products, services, offerings or intellectual property
rights.

against any and all Damages related to or arising out of any claims made by
the Lenders against the Company with respect to the Financing, other than any

misconduct of the Company. Buyer shall reimburse the Company for any
reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company in

consideration for the asset purchase or escrows established with respect
thereto, Buyer shall cause such amounts to be paid promptly to the
Stockholders Representative or its designee (for the benefit of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders).

 



 

(k) In the event that (I) the Womens Health Transaction shall not have been
consummated prior to the later of (x) the date on which all of the conditions
to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied (other than
such conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (but
subject to the ability of those conditions to be satisfied assuming a Closing
would occur)), or (y) the earlier of (A) the fortieth (40th) day following the

material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal to the extent known
and the identity of the person or group making the request, inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Buyer informed on a current basis of the
status and details of any such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Company Option Plan; Notice to Holders of Company Stock
Options_. Prior to Closing, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt
such resolutions and determinations as are necessary under any stock option
plan(s) of the Company for the termination of the Company Stock Options in
exchange for the payments contemplated by this Agreement. At least ten (10)
days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver notice, in a form
complying with the requirements of any such stock option plans and reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, to each holder of Company Stock Options, (i) notifying
such holder of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) notifying each
holder of Company Stock Options that such Company Stock Options shall
accelerate and shall become exercisable in full, and (iii) informing such
holder that the Company Stock Options shall terminate upon the Effective Time,
unless exercised prior thereto, in exchange for the payments contemplated
hereby. The written notice shall provide that each such holder will have at
least five Business Days (expiring no later than the third Business Day prior
to the Effective Time) to exercise his or her Company Stock Option, with such
exercise of any previously unvested portion of the Company Stock Option
contingent on the Closing. No Company Stock Options may be exercised later
than the third Business Day prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Stockholder Approval_.

 



 

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company will
solicit and obtain the approval by written consent of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger by Stockholders holding the
requisite number of shares of each class of the Companys capital stock
required to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger (the "
_Stockholder Approval_ "). Such solicitation shall be in the form of the
Information Statement of the Company (which shall be distributed to the
Stockholders together with Buyers disclosure document for the offer and
issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock). The Company shall take all
other action reasonably necessary to secure the vote or consent of
stockholders required by the DGCL and the Organizational Documents of the
Company to obtain such approval. Within seven (7) Business Days of the
delivery of such stockholder written consent evidencing the Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall distribute to all Stockholders who did not execute
such consent all information and notices required by Sections 228(e) and
262(d)(2) of the DGCL, and, prior to the Closing Date, shall distribute to all
Stockholders the required notice of the "effective date" of the Merger as, and
to the extent, required pursuant to Section 262(d)(2)(i) of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) The Company shall submit to Buyer the form of any written notice and
information described in _Section 5.8(a)_ prior to delivery thereof to the
Stockholders and shall transmit to the Stockholders any such notice unless
Buyer reasonably objects thereto.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Section 280G Approval_. To the extent that any disqualified
individual (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) would be
entitled to any payment or benefit

 



      
 

 



 

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
payment or benefit would potentially constitute a "parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall, prior to Closing:

 



 

(a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a binding written waiver
by such disqualified individual of any portion of such parachute payment that
exceeds $1 less than 3.0 times such disqualified individuals "base amount"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code (collectively, the "
_Waived Amounts_ ") to the extent the Waived Amounts are not subsequently
approved pursuant to a stockholder vote in accordance with the requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the " _280G Stockholder Approval
Requirements_ ");

 



 

(b) provide to the Stockholders disclosure intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code; and

 



 

(c) hold a vote of the Stockholders in a manner that is intended to satisfy
the 280G Stockholder Approval Requirements. Prior to execution of any waivers
or the delivery to the Stockholders of any documents in connection with the
solicitation of such stockholder approval, the Company will have given Buyer
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on final drafts
of all such documents.

 



 

In connection with the foregoing, Buyer shall provide the Company, no later
than fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing Date, with all information and
documents necessary to allow the Company to determine whether any payments
made or to be made or benefits granted or to be granted pursuant to any
agreement or arrangement entered into or negotiated by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing (" _Buyer Payments_ "), together with all
other payments and benefits that any disqualified individual may be entitled
to receive or retain that are treated as being "contingent" (within the
meaning of Code Section 280G) on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, could reasonably be considered to be "parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 5.9_ or otherwise in this Agreement, to the
extent that Buyer has provided misinformation with respect to the Buyer
Payments, or Buyers omission of information has resulted in misinformation,
with respect to any Buyer Payments, there shall be no breach of the covenant
contained in this _Section 5.9_, but only to the extent caused by such
omission or misinformation.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Private Placement; Section 4.3(b) Deliverable_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and the Company acknowledge that the shares of Buyer Common Stock
will not be registered under the Securities Act and would be issued in
reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. The Company shall request from each Fully Diluted Common Holder that
he, she or it provide an Investor Questionnaire to the Company prior to the
Effective Time, and the Company shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of
the same. Any such Fully Diluted Common Holder that does not certify in an
Investor Questionnaire that he, she or it is an "accredited investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act, is hereinafter
referred to as a " _Non-Accredited Investor_."

 



      
 

 



 

(b) On or prior to October 1, 2014, the Buyer shall deliver to the Company an
accurate and correct list in writing of all of the shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of Buyer, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other equity interests of
Buyer, other than Buyer Options issued pursuant to the Buyer Stock Plan or
shares pursuant to exercise of Buyer Options, that were issued from June 30,
2014 until the date of this Agreement, whereupon the information on such list
shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to be a representation and
warranty made pursuant to Section 4.3(b) of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Efforts to Sell Company Product; Extraordinary Transactions_.

 



 

(a) _Buyer s Obligations_. During the period after the Effective Time and
prior to the end of the fifth (5th) calendar year following the Effective
Time, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its
ordinary course of conduct with respect to other products in similar states of
development and of similar market potential (including profit margin), to
market and sell the Company Product in the United States, _provided_ , that
whether certain efforts by Buyer are deemed to be "commercially reasonable"
with respect to the Company Product shall be determined in light of all
relevant factors, taken as a whole, including but not limited to the perceived
market potential of the Company Product (including anticipated and actual
profit margin), the anticipated level of regulatory approval that may be
available for the Company Product (including but not limited to the extent of
the indications for which the Company Product may be approved), as well as any
regulatory exclusivity (to the extent of the duration thereof), the level of
reimbursement that may be available for the Company Product, the Buyers
financial and other resources, the safety and efficacy of the Company Product,
the level of Intellectual Property Rights protection of the Company Product,
the presence of third-party Intellectual Property Rights that may impact the
marketability of the Company Product, the presence or absence of particularly
difficult manufacturing issues, the likely availability and cost of necessary
raw materials, and the expected competitive position of the Company Product
vis-a-vis other therapies that may have been or may be developed, marketed and
sold for the same or similar indications (including FDA-approved generic
equivalents of Company Products), including with respect to the expected or
actual efficacy and cost of such Company Product when compared to such other
products. For purposes of determining whether or not Buyer is complying with
its obligations under the first sentence of this paragraph (a), Buyers
marketing and sales efforts for the Company Product shall be considered in the
aggregate. Buyer shall not be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.11_
for any particular period unless Buyers marketing and sales efforts with
respect to the Company Product during such period, taken as a whole, are not
commercially reasonable.

 



 

(b) _Defense Expenses_. In the event that the Stockholders Representative
initiates any Litigation to enforce its rights or Buyers obligations under
this _Section 5.11_, unless Buyer is found to be material violation of its
obligations under this _Section 5.11_, the Stockholders Representative (out
of the Reserve Amount or as a set off against Contingent Payments) shall
reimburse Buyer for Buyers reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the
defense of such Litigation; _provided_ , that if no further Contingent
Payments are contemplated by this Agreement after the Contingent Payment
Period End Date, the Stockholders Representative shall have to provide other
security for its obligations under this _Section 5.11(b)_ reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer prior to commencing such Litigation, and _provided_ ,
further that if Buyer is found to be

 



      
 

 



 

material violation of its obligations under this _Section 5.11_, Buyer shall
reimburse Stockholders Representative for the Stockholders Representatives
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in pursuing such Litigation.

 



 

(c) _Acknowledgment_. The Fully Diluted Common Holders acknowledge that only
the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Fully Diluted Common
Holders) shall be entitled to enforce the covenants set forth in this _Section
5.11_, and the Fully Diluted Common Holders, by virtue of their approval of
this Agreement, have hereby waived any rights to engage or participate in any
such litigation, pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)._

 



 

(d) _Extraordinary Transactions_. During the Contingent Payment Period, prior
to entering into any agreement or arrangement with respect to, or effecting or
consummating, any proposed sale, license or sublicense, exchange, dividend or
other distribution or liquidation of all or substantially all of the assets,
or all or substantially all of the assets (including Company Intellectual
Property Rights) related to the Company Products, or the capital stock or
equity interests of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in one or a series
of transactions or any merger, consolidation, recapitalization or
reclassification of securities pursuant to which the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation is not the surviving entity of such transaction and that does not
directly or indirectly provide for the assumption by the successor, acquirer
or surviving entity of the obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
set forth in _Section 2.9_, _Section 2.10_ and this _Section 5.11_, Buyer
will notify the Stockholders Representative in writing thereof (if not
previously so notified) and, if requested by the Stockholders Representative,
shall arrange for the obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in _Section 2.9_, _Section 2.10_ and this _Section 5.11_ to be
expressly assumed by such successor, acquirer or surviving entity, in each
case, upon terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholders
Representative.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Interim Operation Covenants of Buyer_. Except (A) as required
by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity, (B) as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement then in effect, (C)
as the Stockholders Representative may consent, which consent may not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (D), as set forth in
Schedule 5.12, during the period from the date hereof until the Closing Date,
the Company shall not, nor permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

 



 

(i) declare or pay any dividends on, or make any other distributions (whether
in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of its capital stock;

 



 

(ii) change the number of issued and outstanding shares of its capital stock
if such change would require the vote of the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the issuance of the Buyer Merger Shares, or split, combine or
reclassify any of its capital stock; or

 



 

(iii) issue or authorize the issuance of any shares of Buyer Common Stock or
options, warrants, convertible securities or rights exercisable therefore or
convertible thereinto (other than (A) issuances of Buyer Common Stock or any
of the foregoing securities for fair market value in connection with bona fide
capital-raising transactions, (B) issuances to sellers in connection with bona
fide

 



      
 

 



 

acquisitions or licensing arrangements by Buyer, (C) issuances of options or
similar rights to acquire Buyer Common Stock, or restricted stock grants,
under the Buyer Stock Plans or otherwise and any shares of Buyer Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such options or other rights or grants in each case
for compensatory purposes, and (D) any issuances of any securities pursuant to
Buyers shareholder rights plan).

 



 

Section 5.13. _Delivery of Financial Statements; Cooperation in Preparing Pro
Forma Financial Statements_. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Company will deliver to Buyer, not later than the date when delivered to the
Companys lenders (in their capacities as such) after the end of each calendar
month, copies of the consolidated financial information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such month that are sent to such lenders (in their capacities
as such). The Company agrees to cooperate, and cause its accountants to
cooperate, in providing (a) historical financial information to Buyer in a
manner for Buyer to satisfy its filing obligations with the SEC and (b) any
other information reasonably requested by Buyer in order to comply with the
requirements of Rule 305 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium" or "control
share acquisition" statute or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to
minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

Section 5.15. _President s Club Incentive; Severance_. Promptly after the
Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to abide by and fulfill each of their respective obligations with respect to
the "Presidents Club" incentive (as set forth on Schedule 5.15) in accordance
with the Companys past practices with respect to the employees of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries who are then employed thereby, but
only to the extent of the accrual therefor in the Net Working Capital. Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and (at and after the
Closing) the Surviving Corporation that the Closing constitutes "good reason"
under the employment agreements of each of the Named Executives and, to the
extent included in the calculation of Transaction Related Expenses, shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the maximum amount of severance
provided for in such employment agreements to the Named Executives on the
Closing Date through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 5.16. _Alternative Women s Health Transaction_. Prior to the Closing,
Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to create an
entity to be the party to consummate the Alternative Womens Health
Transaction, and to as promptly as possible after the date hereof, prepare and
negotiate (in good faith) all documentation (including the Interim TSA)
reasonably necessary to consummate the Alternative Womens Health Transaction;
_provided_ that the parties hereto shall cooperate to effect the Alternative
Womens Health Transaction in a tax-efficient manner to the Company (it being
agreed that the Alternative Womens Health Transaction shall be subject to
_Article VII_ and _Article_ XI hereof with respect to

 



       
 

 



 

all Tax matters, and that for these purposes, tax efficiency refers only to
minimizing actual tax liability resulting directly from the Alternative
Womens Health Transaction, and not to the preservation or optimization of tax
attributes). In the event that the Alternative Womens Health Transaction
occurs, Buyer shall cause Surviving Corporation and its applicable
Subsidiaries to enter into a transition services agreement with the Person(s)
who acquire the Womens Health Division from the New WH Entity(ies), on the
date of the closing of such acquisition, on terms substantially similar to the
terms of the transition services agreement that is attached to the Womens
Health APA.

 



 

Section 5.17. _Treatment of Life Insurance Amounts_. The sum of (x) the life
insurance cash surrender amounts payable to the Company which are the subject
of the disputes between the Company and Marc Hermelin that were settled
pursuant to the Settlement and Release Agreement, dated as of September 15,
2014, by and among the Company, Greg Kenley and Lisa Kenley, as trustees of
the Jacob Trust dated October 17, 1991, and as trustees of the Marc S.
Hermelin Irrevocable Trust dated June 7, 1999, and Marc S. Hermelin and (y)
the $100,000 bond related thereto (the sum of such amounts described in such
clauses (x) and (y), the " _Hermelin Life Insurance Amounts_ ") (i) to the
extent they are not actually received by the Company at or prior to the
Closing, shall not be included as assets for purposes of the calculation of
Net Working Capital or included in Closing Date Cash, (ii) to the extent they
are actually received by the Company at or prior to the Closing, shall be
included in Closing Date Cash, and (iii) to the extent they are actually
received by the Surviving Corporation following the Closing, shall be paid by
the Surviving Corporation to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders, to the extent such payment does not constitute a
Compensatory Payment) and the Surviving Corporation (for further payment to
the Fully Diluted Common Holders, to the extent such payment constitutes a
Compensatory Payment) on the next payroll payment date of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **EMPLOYMENT MATTERS**

 



 

Section 6.1. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation to, continue the employment of each of the employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who were so employed immediately prior to
the Closing Date and who continue to be so employed immediately following the
Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") on terms and conditions that are
no less favorable to each Continuing Employee, in the aggregate, as the terms
and conditions of employment of such Continuing Employee provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, terms relating to salary, incentive
compensation opportunities (other than with respect to equity compensation),
severance benefits and fringe benefits; _provided_ that, if any employee of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not such
employee is a Continuing Employee) is terminated without cause on or following
the Closing but prior to the payment date for bonuses

 



      
 

 



 

in respect of the 2015 fiscal year, then Buyer shall cause the Company to pay
such employee an amount equal to the product of (i) such employees target
bonus for the 2015 fiscal year times (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the period beginning on the first day of the 2015
fiscal year and ending on such employees termination date and the denominator
of which is 365, which amount shall be paid to such employee in addition to,
and not in lieu of, such other benefits as shall be payable to such employee
under the Companys severance policy as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing (but in no event shall any such employee receive such payment if under
an individual agreement such individuals severance includes a pro rata bonus
for the year of termination). In addition, and without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, during the Continuation Period, Buyer shall
offer, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to offer,
each Continuing Employee participation in either the Benefit Plans, or
employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements of
Buyer or its Affiliates (the " _Buyer Plans_ "), in either case, that shall be
substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than the Benefit Plans
(including, without limitation, the Seller 401(k) Plans (as defined below),
taken into account without regard to the plan termination contemplated by
_Section 6.4_) and other employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to such Continuing
Employee. If the Continuing Employees participate in the Buyer Plans, Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
provide coverage for Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under
its or their medical, dental and health plans without interruption of
coverage; (ii) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition, actively at work
requirements and waiting periods (to the extent waived under a comparable
Benefit Plan); and (iii) cause the Buyer Plans to honor any expenses incurred
by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under similar plans
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the calendar year in which
such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent first becomes eligible for
coverage under such Buyer Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. No provision of
this Agreement shall create any obligation on Buyer, its Affiliates or the
Surviving Corporation to maintain the employment of any Continuing Employee
after the Closing Date. Nothing herein shall prevent Buyer, its Affiliates or
the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee during the Continuation Period in compliance with applicable Law and
_Section 6.1(b)_. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee, or any beneficiary or
dependents thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries or
under any benefit plan which Buyer, its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation may maintain.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, during the
Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue
to provide severance pay for the benefit of each Continuing Employee that is
no less favorable than the severance pay provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of each such Continuing Employee as of the date
hereof, as set forth in Schedule 6.1(b).

 



 

Section 6.2. _Credit for Service and Benefit Accrual_. For purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under a
defined benefit pension plan) under each Buyer Plan in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate following the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation to, give each Continuing Employee credit under each such Buyer
Plan for all service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing to the same extent as such service was recognized for such purpose by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and/or their Affiliates prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be credited to
the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

Section 6.3. _WARN_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall not implement, or
permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to implement, any
plant closing, mass layoff, employee layoff, or similar event that
individually or in the aggregate would give rise to any obligations or
liabilities on the part of the Stockholders Representative, any Stockholders
or any of their respective Affiliates under the WARN Act or any similar Law,
and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
provide any required notice under the WARN Act or any similar Law, and to
otherwise comply with any such Law with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or similar Law) or employee layoff
or similar event affecting the employees of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.4. _401(k) Plan Termination_. Effective immediately prior to the
Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries will terminate its Benefit Plan
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_"), and effective immediately
prior to the Closing no employee of the Company or any Subsidiary shall have
any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to the Seller 401(k) Plan. The
Company will provide Buyer with evidence that the Seller 401(k) Plan has been
terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to resolutions
duly adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of a Subsidiary,
as applicable. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such Benefits Plans as Buyer may reasonably require. Buyer
shall maintain a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the
_"Buyer 401(k) Plan_"), and shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept
rollovers, including, without limitation, direct rollovers, to the Buyer
401(k) Plan of the account balances (including, without limitation, to the
extent permitted by the Buyer 401(k) Plan, any loan balances) of any
participant in the Seller 401(k) Plan who is employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries following Closing, pursuant and subject to such reasonable
procedures and conditions as Buyer may adopt.

 



 

Section 6.5. _No Amendment_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Article VI_ shall (i) be deemed to be
the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise limit the right of the
Company, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries
of the Company) or the Surviving Corporation, to amend, modify or terminate
any such employee benefit plan, or (ii) without limiting _Section 12.3_, give
any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Article VI_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 7.1. _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods
that end on or before the Closing Date and must be filed prior to the Closing
Date, taking into account all extensions. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with (i) applicable Law, (ii) this Agreement
and (iii) the past practice of the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those
described in _Section 7.1(a)_) for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Straddle Periods
and Tax Periods that begin after the Closing Date. With respect to such Tax
Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods (the " _Buyer-
Prepared Tax Returns_ "), the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Stockholders or any
former officers or directors of the Company to cooperate, in the preparation
of such Buyer-Prepared Tax Returns in accordance with _Section 7.4_. Each
Buyer-Prepared Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with (i)
applicable Law, (ii) this Agreement and (iii) the past practice of the Company
or applicable Company Subsidiary. Buyer shall deliver to the Stockholders
Representative a draft of each Buyer-Prepared Tax Return that is an Income Tax
Return or any other material Tax Return (as well as any elections requested by
the Stockholders Representative respecting any periods ending on or before
the Closing Date) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return (unless the filing date is less than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, in which case Buyer shall deliver such documents a reasonable
time prior to filing). Buyer shall incorporate all comments proposed by the
Stockholders Representative to such draft Tax Return that would be sustained
on a "more-likely-than-not" basis (based on the determination of the
Stockholders Representative or, if the Buyer disagrees with such basis, based
on the determination of a mutually agreeable nationally recognized law firm or
accounting firm engaged by the Stockholders Representative) (including
requests for elections relating to the Alternative Womens Health
Transaction). Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions of time for filing without penalty or
addition to Tax), all Tax Returns subject to this _Section 7.1(b)_. In the
case of any Tax Return subject to this _Section 7.1(b)_ , Buyer shall recover
any Taxes shown on such Tax Return that are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with _Section 2.15_ or
set-off from the Contingent Payments in accordance _with Section 2.10_, it
being understood that the parties agree to direct the Escrow Agent to disburse
all such amounts to the Company in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period shall be
allocated as follows: (i) in the case of real, personal and intangible
property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ "), the amount attributable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by
multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of Taxes other than
Property Taxes, the amount of any such Taxes allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as deductions for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a
pro rata basis.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.2. _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Fully Diluted
Common Holders (as an inclusion in the calculation of Transaction Related
Expenses) on the other hand, each shall be liable for fifty percent (50%) of
all local, foreign or other excise, sales, use, value added, transfer
(including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing,
recordation and other similar taxes and fees that may be imposed or assessed
as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements,
together with any interest and penalties (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Any Tax
Returns that must be filed in connection with such Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared by Buyer in accordance with applicable Law, and Buyer will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the Stockholders
Representative at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Returns are due to be filed. Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall
cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns. Buyer
shall promptly remit all Transfer Taxes to the appropriate Taxing Authority
and Buyers right to recover the Fully Diluted Common Holders share of any
such Transfer Taxes due after the Closing (to the extent not already included
in the calculation of Merger Consideration) shall be treated as if such right
to recover were a Tax Claim hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.3. _Contest Provisions_.

 



 

(a) Each of Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall promptly notify
the other upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits or
assessments with respect to Taxes for which such other party (or such other
partys Affiliates) may be liable hereunder (each a " _Tax Contest_ ");
_provided_ , however, that the failure to deliver such notice shall not affect
any of the parties obligations hereunder unless such party was materially
prejudiced by the delay in notice. The Stockholders Representative shall be
entitled to participate at its expense in the defense of and, at its option,
take control of the complete defense of, any Tax Contest relating solely to
any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, including any settlement
or other disposition thereof (subject to the last sentence of _Section
7.3(c)_), and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. The
Stockholders Representative shall exercise such option by providing to Buyer
written acknowledgment of the indemnification obligations of the Fully Diluted
Common Holders and written notice of such election within twenty (20) days of
the Stockholders Representatives receipt of notice pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 7.3_; _provided_ , that if the Stockholders
Representative fails to exercise such option within such twenty (20)-day
period, Buyer shall assume control and complete defense of such Tax Contest
(subject to the last sentence of _Section 7.3(c)_). Buyer shall, at the cost
of the Stockholders Representative (provided that the Stockholders
Representative will only be liable for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
such expenses shall be paid solely from the Reserve Amount), procure all
assistance the Stockholders Representative may reasonably require in relation
to any action taken with respect to such Tax Contest. Buyer shall ensure that
the Stockholders Representative is authorized to take such action on behalf
and in the name of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as the
Stockholders Representative may reasonably request with respect to such Tax
Contest, including responding (in writing or otherwise) to any audit inquiry
from any Taxing Authority, attending and conducting interviews, meetings,
discussions and negotiations with any Taxing Authority, negotiating and
concluding compromises, agreements and settlements with any Taxing Authority,
lodging requests for rulings, opinions or determinations with any Taxing
Authority or lodging or instituting objections, applications, appeals and
other Litigations with any Taxing Authority, tribunal or court.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) With respect to any Tax Contest relating to a Straddle Period, the Tax
Items subject to such Tax Contest shall be distinguished among those for which
the Fully Diluted Common Holders, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand, are liable, and the Stockholders Representative or the Buyer,
respectively, shall control the defense of those Taxes for which it is liable.
If any Tax Item cannot be identified as being a liability exclusively of one
party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for which the other party is
liable, the party which has the greater potential liability for such Tax Items
shall control the defense of the Tax Contest.

 



 

(c) In controlling the conduct of all or any portion of a Tax Contest
described in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _(b)_ , the controlling party shall: (i)
keep the non-controlling party reasonably informed regarding the status and
progress of such Tax Contest; and (ii) provide to the non-controlling party
drafts of any material correspondence to any Taxing Authority and consider in
good faith any comments of the non-controlling party (or its advisors) on the
correspondence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the
Stockholders Representative nor Buyer may agree to settle any claim for Taxes
for a Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Tax
Period without the prior consent of such other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds or amounts credited against Tax
that are received or realized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the Fully Diluted
Common Holders; it being understood that any loss generated in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period that is applied in or in respect of a taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date shall not constitute a Tax refund or credit against Tax
that is for the account of the Fully Diluted Common Holders. Buyer shall cause
the Company to pay any such Tax refund or the value of such credit against Tax
received or realized after the Closing Date to the Paying Agent (for payment
to the Fully Diluted Common Holders) no later than ten (10) Business Days
after receipt thereof); _provided_ , that Buyer shall cause any such amounts
attributable to Persons holding Company Stock Option or a Company RSU
immediately prior to the Merger to be paid through the Companys payroll
system (with reduction for any applicable withholding required by applicable
Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if any Tax refund or credit against
Tax giving rise to any payment to the Paying Agent (for payment to the Fully
Diluted Common Holders) is subsequently disallowed or reduced, the Fully
Diluted Common Holders shall indemnify and hold harmless (solely from the
Indemnity Escrow Account or pursuant to the set-off provision in Section
2.10(c)) the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any Tax to them that
is attributable to such disallowance or reduction in accordance with _Article
XI_, and (y) no such Tax refund or credit against Tax shall be paid to the
Paying Agent (for payment to the Fully Diluted Common Holders) during the
pendency of any Tax Contest to the extent of any potential Tax Claim. The
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be, upon final resolution of such Tax Claim,
be entitled to set-off the Tax refund or credit against Tax against all or a
portion of the Tax Claim.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Assistance and Cooperation_. Following the Closing Date, each of
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate fully in preparing
any Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and in
preparing for any audits of, inquiries by, or disputes with any Taxing
Authorities regarding, any applicable Tax Returns with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries and payments in respect thereof, including (a) providing
timely notice to the other (pursuant to _Section 7.3_) of any pending or
proposed audits or assessments

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to Taxes for which such other party or any of its Affiliates may
have a liability under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (b) subject
to _Section 7.3_, furnishing the other with copies of all relevant
correspondence received from any Taxing Authority (whether before, on, or
after the Closing Date) in connection with any Tax Contest and (c) making
available to the other party during normal business hours, all Books and
Records, Tax Returns or portions thereof (together with related paperwork and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities),
proof of payment of Taxes, documents, files, officers or employees (without
substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant information
reasonably necessary or useful for such purposes, in each case, whether or not
in existence as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 7.6. _Maintenance of Buyer s Books and Records_. Until the applicable
statute of limitations (including periods of waiver) has run for any Tax
Returns filed or required to be filed with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries covering Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain or cause to be retained all
Books and Records in existence on the Closing Date and, following the Closing
Date (but only to the extent relevant to any Pre-Closing Tax Period), shall
provide the Stockholders Representative access to such Books and Records and
the equivalent Books and Records prepared following the Closing Date for
inspection and copying by the Stockholders Representative and its Affiliates,
or their agents upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. After the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including periods of
waiver), no such Books and Records shall be destroyed by Buyer without first
advising the Stockholders Representative in writing and giving the
Stockholders Representative a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
thereof, with any costs of transferring the Books and Records to be paid by
the Stockholders Representative.

 



 

Section 7.7. _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Any payment by Buyer or the
Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section 2.14_
or _Article XI_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for Tax purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

Payment, except to the extent that any such treatment arises out of Buyers
breach of _Section 5.9_ (collectively, the " _Excess Parachute Claims_ ");
and

 



 

(f) except to the extent arising out of the items described in Section
_11.1(c)_ , regardless of any disclosure on the schedules hereto, any out-of-
pocket Damages (whether or not incurred as a result of a Third Party Claim)
arising out of the ownership and operation of the Womens Health Division by
the Company or any other party either before, at or after the Effective Time,
or the transactions contemplated by the Womens Health APA, including any
expenses related to the separation of the Womens Health Division from the
Company (which shall include any severance obligations with respect to the
employees of the Womens Health Division, except to the extent included in the
definition of Transaction Related Expenses), any claims made by the Womens
Health Buyer against any party in respect of the Womens Health APA or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby (including
in respect of fraud), and any breach of the agreements referred to in, or
entered into pursuant to, _Section 5.2(k)_ (other than any breach of such
sublicense agreements by Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries) (collectively, " _Women s Health Claims_").

 



 

Without limiting the foregoing, in addition to the individual indemnification
obligations of the Fully Diluted Common Holders set forth herein, the ability
of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation to recover for any Damages under this
_Section 11.2_ shall represent an express contract right to seek recovery
from the Indemnity Escrow Account (subject to the limitations contained in
this _Article XI_) in accordance with the terms thereof, and nothing in this
_Article XI_ shall be deemed to require Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to
obtain jurisdiction over any Fully Diluted Common Holder, or pursue any
process in connection therewith beyond that expressly required by the terms of
the Escrow Agreement or _Section 11.3_ below. Buyers and the Surviving
Corporations rights of recovery hereunder are severable and distinct;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled
to recover the same Damages more than once (in the aggregate) under all of
such sections. Buyer acknowledges that except in the case of fraud, (A) the
sole and exclusive remedy of all Buyer Indemnified Parties to receive payments
owed to it under _Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.2(b)_ arising out of (i)
the breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
(other than Special Representations), or (ii) the breach of any covenant
contained in this Agreement that is required to be performed prior to Closing,
excluding in the case of clause (ii) any Willful Breach (each, an " _Ordinary
Breach_ ") shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount and shall be recoverable solely from the funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account, and (B) the sole and exclusive remedy of all Buyer Indemnified
Parties to receive payments owed to it under _Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section
11.2(b)_ arising out the breach of this Agreement other than an Ordinary
Breach shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount and any

 



      
 

 



 

Contingent Payments, and shall be recoverable solely from the funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account or by offset against the Contingent Payments as
provided in _Section 2.10(c)_. In the event that the funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account are insufficient to pay to any Buyer Indemnified Parties any
amounts owed to it arising from an Ordinary Breach, no Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to collect any remaining amounts not satisfied from the
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and neither the Stockholders
Representative, any of the other Stockholders, holders of Company Stock
Options or holders of Company RSUs, nor any of the other Escrow Accounts, nor
the Contingent Payments (pursuant to any set off or otherwise) nor any other
Person shall have any liability for or be a source of recovery for any such
deficiency, nor any other Person shall have any liability for or be a source
of recovery for any such deficiency.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under _Section 11.2(a)_ or _11.2(b)_ above, to the extent relating
solely to the Womens Health Division, and Damages under Womens Health
Claims, shall be limited to Out of Pocket Damages, and shall exclude any
Damages relating to the value of the Womens Health Division or any benefit to
the Company, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries arising out of the Womens Health Division.

 



 

Section 11.3. _Third-Party Claims; Direct Claim Procedures_. Except to the
extent addressed in _Article VII_ with respect to Tax Contests:

 



 

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party desires to make a claim against an
Indemnifying Party (which term shall be deemed to include all Indemnifying
Parties if more than one) in connection with any third-party Litigation for
which it may seek indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party will promptly (and in any event within 30 days after
becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party (or,
if the Indemnifying Party is the Company, the Stockholders or the Fully
Diluted Common Holders, the Stockholders Representative), of such Third-Party
Claim and of its claims of indemnification with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
that failure to promptly give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations under this _Section 11.3_, except to
the extent, if any, that the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced
thereby.

 



 

(b) Subject to paragraph (e) below, to the extent that the only remedy sought
by the third-party in such Third-Party Claim are monetary damages, and the
maximum amount of such monetary damages claimed by the Third Party is less
than an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Account that is not then the subject of a pending Indemnification Claim
by the Buyer, _plus_ (y) the sum of the amount of any Contingent Payments for
which a Contingent Payment Trigger Notice has been delivered (or is required
to be delivered as a result of the conditions to the applicable Contingent
Payment having been achieved) _plus_ , the amount of the First Milestone
Payment, to the extent the First Milestone Payment has not been paid (if such
claim would otherwise be subject to indemnification by way of offset from such
First Milestone Payment), the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume
the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by written notice to the Indemnified
Party within twenty (20) days after the Indemnifying Party has received notice
of the Third-Party Claim and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defense at its expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Indemnifying Party must

 



      
 

 



 

conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim commercially reasonably actively
and diligently, and (ii) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel
at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party
Claim.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of all liability of each
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim, (ii) involves only
the payment of money damages that are fully covered by the Indemnifying Party
(including amounts deemed to be paid by the Fully Diluted Common Holders
pursuant to _Section 11.4_ by distribution of amounts to Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation from escrow), and (iii) does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim for which an
Indemnified Party has sought indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any Liability with respect to, settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably recommend and that by its
terms (i) solely obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay (or obligates the use
of the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account) the full amount of Damages in
connection with such Third-Party Claim and (ii) fully releases the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party
Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of Books and Records
and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees and Representatives available on a mutually convenient basis
during normal business hours to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall comply with _Section 5.4_ hereof in any such interactions, and
shall cause all communications among employees, counsel and others
representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 



 

(e) Except with respect to claims relating to Taxes (which are the subject of
_Article VII_), each Indemnified Party shall assert any claim on account of
any Damages which do not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_
") by giving the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that have
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that failure
to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under this _Section 11.3_, except to the extent,
if any, that the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced thereby.

 



 

Section 11.4. _Payment of Claims_. In the event of any bona fide claim for
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party will advise the Indemnifying
Party that is

 



      
 

 



 

required to provide indemnification therefor in writing. With respect to
liquidated claims for Damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for
the payment thereof upon the earlier of (w) the issuance of a final non-
appealable order from a court of competent jurisdiction directing such
payment, (x) a settlement to which the Indemnifying Party has consented, (y)
the date on which the Buyer and the Stockholders Representative agree in
writing that such payment must be paid, and (z) the final resolution of a Tax
Claim in accordance with _Section 7.3_, subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 11.5_ and except as set forth in the following sentence of this
_Section 11.4_, within ten (10) days after such order is issued, such
settlement or mutual written agreement is executed, or such resolution is
reached. In order to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the Company,
the Stockholders and the Fully Diluted Common Holders with respect to any
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_ (other than claims
under _Section 11.2(c)_), Buyer and the Surviving Corporation (and each of
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and other
Affiliates) shall have the right to recover Damages that have been incurred,
at the election of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, first, from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to the extent available, or, solely with respect to
claims pursuant to _Section 11.2_ (other than _Section 11.2(c)_ or with
respect to an Ordinary Breach) to the extent there are no funds remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account sufficient to satisfy such Damages, by offset
from the Contingent Payments pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.10(c)_. All
such recoveries from the Indemnity Escrow Account and offsets against
Contingent Payments shall be made on a _pro rata_ basis from all Fully Diluted
Common Holders in the same proportions in which they would otherwise be
entitled to receive such escrowed funds or Contingent Payments. The parties
agree that to the greatest extent permitted by Law the payment of any
indemnity hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration paid by Buyer hereunder for Tax purposes.

 



 

Section 11.5. _Limitations of Liability_.

 



 

(a) _Threshold_. No Indemnifying Party will be required to indemnify an
Indemnified Party hereunder until such time as the aggregate amount of
determined or reasonably expected Damages for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Indemnified Parties, on the other
hand, are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement
exceeds three million three hundred seventy five thousand dollars ($3,375,000)
(the " _Basket Threshold_ "), at which time the Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for the full amount of such
Damages (including the amounts below the Basket Threshold). No Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party hereunder for any
Damages arising out of any particular related set of facts and circumstances
and such Damages shall not be indemnifiable or counted toward satisfaction of
the Basket Threshold unless they exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in
the aggregate (the " _Mini-Basket Threshold_ "), at which time the
Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for
the full amount of such Damages (including the amounts below the Mini-Basket
Threshold), but subject to the Basket Threshold and the other limitations
contained in this _Article XI_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 11.5_, the threshold limits imposed by this _Section 11.5(a)_
shall not apply to any Damages arising out of or in connection with (and such
Damages shall not be included in the calculation of Basket Threshold or Mini-
Basket Threshold) (A) any breach of any Special Representations (other than
the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.4(a)_ , _3.11_ and _3.18_ )
(B) any Special Claims (other than the

 



      
 

 



 

representations and warranties in _Sections 3.4(a)_ , _3.11_ and _3.18_ ), (C)
any Willful Breaches of this Agreement, or (D) fraud.

 



 

(b) _Time Limit_. All representations and warranties, and covenants and
agreement required to be performed prior to the Closing, in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and shall expire on, and no Indemnifying Party will
be liable for any Damages hereunder with respect to a breach of such
representations and warranties, or any breaches of covenants to be performed
prior to Closing (other than Willful Breaches of this Agreement), unless a
written claim for indemnification is given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party with respect thereto prior to, the Survival Date;
_provided_ , that, subject to _Section 2.10(c)_, (A) the Special
Representations and the representations or warranties in _Section 3.15_ of
this Agreement shall survive, and claims with respect thereto may be made, and
Tax Claims may be made, until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes at issue (including all
extensions to which the Stockholders Representative has consented, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), (B) all other claims under _Section
11.2(d)_ through _Section 11.2(f)_ may be made until the applicable covenant,
agreement, obligation or undertaking is performed, and (C) any claims based on
fraud shall survive, and such claims based on fraud may be made, indefinitely.

 



 

(c) _Maximum Liability_. The maximum aggregate liability of all of Fully
Diluted Common Holders, on the one hand, and of Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation, on the other hand, pursuant to this _Article XI_ for Damages
arising out of or in connection with claims for an Ordinary Breach will not
exceed a maximum amount equal to the aggregate amount originally deposited
into the Indemnity Escrow Account, and with respect to other claims, a maximum
amount equal to the aggregate amount originally deposited into the Indemnity
Escrow Account and any amounts which may be offset from Contingent Payments in
accordance with _Section 2.10(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 11.5_, the maximum liability limits imposed by this _Section
11.5(c)_ shall not apply to any Damages arising out of or in connection with
fraud.

 



 

(d) _Other Limitations on Liability_.

 



 

(i) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover from the
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Article XI_ more than once in respect
of the same Damages suffered. The Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Article
XI_ more than once in respect of the same Damages suffered.

 



 

(ii) Each Indemnified Party shall comply with all obligations it may have to
mitigate any indemnifiable Damage under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Sole Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except
in the case of fraud and except to the extent provided in _Section 2.10(c)_
(Unilateral Right of Set-Off), _Section 2.10(d)_ (Set-Off for Additional
Transaction Costs), _Section 2.14_ (Post-Closing Merger Consideration
Adjustment), _Section 5.5_ (Directors and Officers Exculpation;
Indemnification), _Article VII_ (Tax Matters), _Article X_ (Termination),
_Section 12.6_ (Equitable Relief) or _Section 12.18_ (Stockholders
Representative), from and after the Closing, the rights and remedies of

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer, the Company, the Stockholders Representative and the Fully Diluted
Common Holders, and any Indemnified Party, under this _Article XI_ shall be
exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which Buyer,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders Representative, or
the Fully Diluted Common Holders, or any Indemnified Party, may have under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or any related certificate,
document or instrument, or otherwise against each other with respect to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or any related certificate, document or
instrument, and with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
_Section 11.5(e)_ shall have any effect on the Commitment Letter, the Option
Cancellation Agreements, the Letters of Transmittal, the RSU Cancellation
Agreements, the Registration Rights/Lock-Up Agreement, the Interim TSA or the
Final TSA.

 



 

Section 11.6. _Adjustments to Damages_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Indemnified Party
shall have any right to indemnification under this _Article XI_ with respect
to the amount of any Damages to the extent such Indemnified Party was
previously made whole for such Damages on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the
calculation of the Final Payment Amount (or any component thereof) (as finally
agreed upon or determined pursuant to _Section 2.14_) or that is otherwise
taken into account on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the calculation of any
adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.14_.

 



 

(b) No Indemnified Party shall have any right to assert any claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder with respect to any Damage, cause of action or
other claim to the extent such Damage, cause of action or claim is a Damage,
cause of action or claim with respect to which such Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) in bad faith
with the primary intent of accelerating the time period in which such matter
is asserted or payable in order to cause a claim to be made prior to the
applicable Survival Date, and such Damages would not otherwise be subject to
indemnification because of the expiration of such Survival Date.

 



 

(c) For all purposes of this _Article XI_, "Damages" shall be net of (i) any
amounts actually paid to an Indemnified Party under any insurance policy or
Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that the amount deemed to be paid
under such insurance policies or Contracts shall be net of (x) the deductible
for such policies and (y) any increase in the premium for such policies
arising from such Losses; _provided further_ that at the request of the
Stockholders Representative, each Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Stockholders Representatives expense
from the Reserve Account or as set off against the Contingent Payments, to
recover all amounts payable from an insurer or other third party under any
such insurance policy or Contract under which it could reasonably be expected
to recover amounts in respect of such Damages, and (ii) the amount of any Tax
benefits actually realized by such Indemnified Party for the taxable period in
which such Damages occur, determined on a "with or without" basis. In the
event that an Indemnified Party receives amounts in respect of Damages from a
third party under an insurance policy or Contract, it shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnifying Party for any such Damages previously paid to the Indemnified
Party by the Indemnifying Party under this _Article XI_ (it being agreed
that, if the applicable indemnification payment was made from the Escrow
Account

 



       
 

 



 

or as a set off against a Contingent Payment, such reimbursement payment shall
be made to the Stockholders Representative or its designee (for the benefit
of the Fully Diluted Common Holders).

 



 

(d) If any Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries recovers any Damages from a third party which are the subject
matter of a claim for which such Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, is seeking indemnification hereunder, the amount
of such recovery actually received by such Buyer Indemnified Party or the
Surviving Corporation (less any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in
obtaining such recovery) shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be, the
amount of Damages payable under such claim hereunder. In the event that the
Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation has already recovered the
full amount of such claim hereunder from the Stockholders Representative or
the Fully Diluted Common Holders (including by way of recovery from the Escrow
Amount or offset against Contingent Payments), then such Buyer Indemnified
Party or the Surviving Corporation shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the
Stockholders Representative or its designee (for the benefit of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders) the amount recovered and actually received from a
third party as described above (less any reasonable costs incurred in
obtaining such recovery), or, if less, the amount previously recovered from
the Stockholders Representative or the Fully Diluted Common Holders, as soon
as practicable after receipt thereof.

 



 

Section 11.7. _Right to Bring Action; No Contribution_. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Article XI_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary,
only the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Fully Diluted Common
Holders) shall have the right, power and authority to commence any action,
suit or proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding, by and on behalf of
any or all Fully Diluted Common Holders against Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, or any other Indemnified Party, and in no event shall any Fully
Diluted Common Holder himself, herself or itself have the direct right to
commence any action, suit or proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding,
against Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, or any other Indemnified Party.

Section 12.2. _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, (i) in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative, or (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom
such waiver is intended to be effective (provided that the Stockholders
Representative may waive any provision of this Agreement on behalf of any
Fully Diluted Common Holder); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the adoption
of this Agreement by the requisite number of Stockholders in accordance with
the Organizational Documents of the Company and the provisions of the DGCL, no
amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval by the
Stockholders without obtaining such requisite approval under the DGCL, except
to the extent the approval of such Stockholders can be given by the
Stockholders Representative under applicable law. No failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. In addition, any portion of _Section 12.3, 12.9 _or _12.10_ of
this Agreement relating to the Financing Sources, and defined terms relating
thereto may not be amended or modified, and no waiver or consent thereunder
may be granted, without the written consent of the Lenders.

 



 

Section 12.3. _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto and any purported assignment
in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without such consent, each of Buyer and Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement and its rights hereunder to its Financing Sources as collateral
security for Indebtedness; _provided_ , that no such assignment

 



      
 

 



 

shall relieve Buyer or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Except to the
extent expressly set forth in _Section 5.5_, _Section 12.2_, _Section
12.9_, _Section 12.16_, _Section 12.18(e), Section 12.19 _and _Section
12.20_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person other than Buyer, the Company, the Stockholders and the
Stockholders Representative, and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fully
Diluted Common Holders are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may
suffer losses for any breach of this Agreement by the Buyer (or, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) or the Merger Sub. The provisions of this
Agreement are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the
Stockholders Representative for the benefit of, the Fully Diluted Common
Holders, and the Stockholders Representative shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to enforce any obligations of the Buyer, the Merger Sub, or
the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement for the benefit of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders.

 



 

Section 12.4. _Entire Agreement; Inconsistency_. This Agreement (including all
Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.
In the event and to the extent that there shall be an inconsistency between
the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. The
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair
meaning and neither for nor against any party hereto irrespective of which
party caused such provisions to be drafted. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by an attorney in connection with
the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

Section 12.5. _Satisfaction of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to
any other under this Agreement, that is performed, satisfied or fulfilled
completely by an Affiliate of such party shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 



 

Section 12.6. _Equitable Relief_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed as required by their
specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, irreparable damage will occur
and no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches, and to specific performance of the terms, of
this Agreement (including causing the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in
this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. No party
hereto shall oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to raise as a
defense that an adequate remedy at Law exists or that specific performance or
equitable or injunctive relief is inappropriate or unavailable. The parties
hereto further agree that nothing in this _Section 12.6_ shall require any
party hereto to institute any Litigation for specific performance under this
_Section 12.6_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article X_, nor shall the commencement of any Litigation pursuant to
this _Section 12.6_ or anything set forth in this _Section 12.6_ restrict or
limit the parties respective right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms hereof; it being understood and agreed by the parties, prior to
the Closing, that during the pendency of any Litigation initiated by a party
under this _Section 12.6_, each of the parties shall maintain their
respective rights to terminate this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement under _Section 10.1_. If the Stockholders Representative or, prior
to the Closing, the Company brings any Litigation to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party (or a
Litigation for monetary damages as described in the following sentence) and
the Outside Date has not yet passed, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by (x) the amount of time during which such Litigation is pending,
plus 20 Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the
Delaware Court presiding over such Litigation. If the Stockholders
Representative or, prior to the Closing, the Company institutes a Litigation
for injunctive relief or specific performance and a court of competent
jurisdiction does not award injunctive relief or specific performance to the
Stockholders Representative or the Company in a final order, judgment,
injunction or decree in accordance with this _Section 12.6_, then the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Fully Diluted Common Holders)
may institute a Litigation for monetary damages against Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Stockholders
Representative or the Company are awarded injunctive relief or specific
performance as a result of which the Closing actually occurs, such equitable
relief shall be the Stockholders Representative or Fully Diluted Common
Holders sole and exclusive remedy against Buyer under this Agreement solely
with respect to Buyers failure to consummate the Closing.

 



 

Section 12.7. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary herein, (x) all filing fees to be paid in connection with the HSR Act
or any other Competition/Investment Law shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by
the Company by its inclusion in the calculation of Transaction Related
Expenses, and (y) the premium in respect of the DandO Insurance set forth in
_Section 5.5_ shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Company by its
inclusion in the calculation of Transaction Related Expenses.

 



 

Section 12.8. _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter, or reference to any
Contract, in any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure
of such matter or Contract for all purposes of this Agreement to which such
matter or Contract could reasonably be expected to be pertinent, but shall not
be deemed to constitute an admission by Buyer or the Company, the
Stockholders Representative or any Fully Diluted Common Holder or to
otherwise imply that any such matter or Contract is material for the purposes
of this Agreement and shall not affect the interpretation of such term for the
purposes of this Agreement. In particular, (a) certain matters may be
disclosed on the Schedules that may not be required to be disclosed because of
certain minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement, and (b) the disclosure of any such matter does not mean that it
meets or surpasses any such minimum thresholds or materiality standards. In no
event shall the listing of such matters in any Schedule be deemed or
interpreted to expand the scope of the Companys representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement. Each Schedule is qualified in its
entirety by reference to specific provisions of the Agreement and does not
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations,
warranties or covenants of Buyer or the Company or their respective
Affiliates, except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement. Matters
reflected in a Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters or Contracts
required by this Agreement to be disclosed in such Schedules. Regardless of
the existence or absence of cross-references, the disclosure of any

 



      
 

 



 

matter in any Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure for purposes of this
Agreement and each Schedule to the extent that the relevance of such
disclosure is readily apparent from its text. The section headings in the
Schedules are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any information disclosed
herein or any provision of this Agreement. All attachments to the Schedules
are incorporated by reference into the Schedule in which they are directly or
indirectly referenced. The information contained in the Schedules is in all
events subject to _Section 5.4_ and the Confidentiality Agreement.

in this Agreement shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner

that another forum is more convenient. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) nothing in this _Section 12.9_ shall prohibit any party from
seeking or obtaining orders for conservatory or interim relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction and (ii) each party hereto agrees that any judgment
issued by a Delaware Court may be recognized, recorded, registered or enforced
in any jurisdiction in the world and waives any and all objections or defenses
to the recognition, recording, registration or enforcement of such judgment in
any such jurisdiction. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT
BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD
PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER

deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or

Diluted Common Holder or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of any Person against
Buyer, the Stockholders, the Stockholders Representative or the Party
Affiliates by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
Litigation, by virtue of any Law, or otherwise; _provided_ that this _Section
12.16_ shall not apply to claims of fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the parties acknowledge and agree that the term "fraud," as
used in this Agreement (and all of the exceptions for fraud in this
Agreement), means a claim for fraud arising under applicable Law and shall not
mean a claim for fraud pursuant to this Agreement or any other Ancillary
Agreement, and that in no event shall anything in this Agreement be construed
to or deemed to create a contractual claim or right of action for fraud
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any Fully Diluted Common
Holder have or be subject to any liabilities (under any theory of liability
whatsoever, including contract, tort, fraud or otherwise) in connection with

Section 12.18. _Stockholders  Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Fully Diluted Common Holders hereby irrevocably appoint the

Representative shall have no other duties or obligations, at law, in equity,
by contract or otherwise, to act on behalf of any Fully Diluted Common Holder,
except for those duties or obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders
Representative shall be granted the power to take any of the following actions
on behalf of such Fully Diluted Common Holders: (i) to execute and deliver

respect to the investment of any such funds, nor shall it have any liability
for any loss incurred in connection with the investment of the Escrow Amount;
(xii) to finalize any post-Closing adjustment of the Merger Consideration;
(xiii) to distribute any amounts to the Fully Diluted Common Holders after the
Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 2.14_, _Section

acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders,

her or its sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to consummate the Merger

 



       
 

 



 

and carry out the activities described in this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Womens Health APA and the ancillary agreements related
thereto. The Stockholders Representative shall not be responsible for any
damages, losses, charges, liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits,
judgments, settlements, awards, interest, penalties, fees, costs and expenses
suffered by, or liability of any kind to, such Fully Diluted Common Holders
arising out of any act done or omitted by the Stockholders Representative in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholders
Representatives duties hereunder, except to the extent such act or omission
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



 

(c) Such appointment of the Stockholders Representative by the Fully Diluted
Common Holders is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked in whole or
in part (including, without limitation, upon the death or incapacity of any
such Fully Diluted Common Holder). Such appointment is binding upon the heirs,
executors, administrators, estates, personal representatives, successors and
assigns of each such Fully Diluted Common Holder. All decisions of the
Stockholders Representative are final and binding on all of the Fully Diluted
Common Holders, and shall be deemed authorized, approved, ratified and
confirmed by the Fully Diluted Common Holders, having the same force and
effect as if performed by, or pursuant to the direct authorization of, the
Fully Diluted Common Holders, and no Fully Diluted Common Holder shall have
any right to challenge or otherwise question any such action, decision or
instruction. Each Fully Diluted Common Holder hereby waives any and all
defenses which may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of
the Stockholders Representative taken in connection with the authority
granted by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Stockholders Representative shall receive no compensation for service
as such, but shall be entitled to hold the Reserve Amount, and to use all or a
portion of the Reserve Amount to satisfy its payment obligations under this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, the Womens Health APA or the ancillary
agreements related thereto and to reimburse itself for any and all expenses,
charges and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the
Stockholders Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties
pursuant to this _Section 12.18_; _provided_ , _however_ , the Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to hire counsel, accountants, tax preparers
and other advisors and experts to assist or advise it in connection with the
performance of its rights or obligations pursuant to this _Section 12.18_ or
under the Escrow Agreement, and all such reasonable expenses incurred by the
Stockholders Representative, including expenses relating to any such counsel,
accountant, tax preparer, advisor or expert, shall be reimbursed using the
Reserve Amount.

 



 

(e) The Fully Diluted Common Holders shall indemnify the Stockholders
Representative for, and shall hold the Stockholders Representative harmless
against, any damage, loss, charge, liability, claim, demand, action, suit,
judgment, settlement, award, interest, penalty, fee, cost and expense
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by the
Stockholders Representative or any of its Affiliates and any of their
respective managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, members,
partners, stockholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants, advisors,
brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in each case relating to the
Stockholders Representatives conduct or role as Stockholders
Representative, other than damages, losses, charges, liabilities, claims,
demands, actions, suits, judgments, settlements, awards, interest, penalties,
fees, costs and expenses that have been finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have primarily resulted from the Stockholders
Representatives

 



      
 

 



 

fraud or willful misconduct in connection with its performance under this
Agreement. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. The Stockholders Representative shall have the right to cause the
satisfaction of some or all of such indemnification obligations using any then
available proceeds contained in the Reserve Amount. The Stockholders
Representative may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the
advice of counsel, advisor or expert, and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Stockholders Representative in accordance with
such advice, and the Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to the
Fully Diluted Common Holders or any other Person in connection therewith. In
no event shall the Stockholders Representative be liable hereunder or in
connection herewith for any consequential, indirect, incidental, special,
unforeseen, exemplary or punitive damages, including diminution of value, loss
of business or reputation or opportunity, and in particular, without
limitation, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of damages,
losses, charges, liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments,
settlements, awards, interest, penalties, fees, costs and expenses. The
Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any Fully Diluted Common
Holder for any action taken or omitted by the Stockholders Representative
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other document executed or
delivered hereunder, or in connection therewith, except that the Stockholders
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law to the
extent it is finally determined to have primarily resulted from fraud or
willful misconduct of the Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(f) Except to the extent that the applicable offer or sale would constitute a
"public offering" or require registration under any federal or state
securities laws, in the event that the Stockholders Representative proposes
after the Closing to issue or sell any equity securities, it shall offer to
sell to each Fully Diluted Common Holder such Fully Diluted Common Holders
Ratable Portion of such equity securities on the same terms and conditions and
at the lowest price as such equity securities are offered for issuance or
sale. " _Ratable Portion_ " shall mean, with respect to, any Fully Diluted
Common Holder, the ratio of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock, plus the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of the
Company Stock Options, plus the number of shares of Common Stock underlying
the Company RSUs, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are owned by such Fully Diluted Common Holder over (ii) the Fully
Diluted Share Number. The Stockholders Representative shall give notice of
the proposed issuance of Securities to each Fully Diluted Common Holder
described in this _Section 12.18(f)_ not less than twenty (20) days before
the closing of the proposed issuance. Such notice shall contain all material
terms and conditions of the issuance and of the equity securities to be
issued. Each such Fully Diluted Common Holder may elect to exercise all or any
portion of its rights under this _Section 12.18(f)_ by giving written notice
(a " _Response Notice_ ") to the Stockholders Representative within fifteen
(15) days of the receipt of the Stockholders Representatives notice.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that any
Additional Merger Consideration is paid, to the extent that any capital is
contributed to the Stockholders Representative after the date hereof, any
Additional Merger Consideration that would otherwise be paid or distributed to
the Fully Diluted Common Holders (or the Stockholders Representative, its
designee or the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Fully Diluted Common
Holders) shall instead be retained by the Stockholders Representative to
repay, reimburse or distribute to the Fully Diluted Common Holders who have
contributed capital to the Stockholders Representative prior to the date of

 



      
 

 



 

such payment, and the amount in excess of such retained amount shall be
distributed to the Fully Diluted Common Holders.
