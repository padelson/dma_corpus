2.8(b)_ and (y) the amounts that Parent is entitled to withhold to fund the
Representative Expense Fund pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_, upon the surrender

Agreement and in the manner provided herein. From and after the Effective
Time, each share of Vested Company Capital Stock that is cancelled and
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration by virtue of the
Merger pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)(i)_ shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Vested

withholding, the amounts that Parent is entitled to withhold to fund the
Escrow Fund pursuant to  _Section 2.8(b)_, and the amounts that Parent is
entitled to withhold to fund the Representative Expense Fund pursuant to
_Section 2.8(c)_), upon the surrender of such certificate (or alternatively,
a Lost Stock Certificate Affidavit and a Lost Certificate Indemnity
Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in the manner
provided herein. For purposes of calculating the amount of cash payable to
each Company Stockholder in respect of such stockholders shares of Vested
Company Capital Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)(i)_, (A) all of the
shares of Vested Company Capital Stock held by each Company Stockholder shall
be aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, (B) the amount of cash
payable in respect of each such certificate shall be rounded down to the
nearest cent and (C) no cash shall be paid in respect of fractional shares.

 

(ii) _Company Treasury Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each
share of Company Capital Stock that is outstanding and owned by the Company as
treasury stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company
Treasury Stock_ ") shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall thereupon cease to exist.

(iii) _Parent Owned Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each share of Company Capital Stock that is outstanding and owned by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Parent-Owned Company Capital Stock_ ") shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
thereupon cease to exist and the Per Share Consideration otherwise payable in
respect of such shares of Parent-Owned Capital Stock shall be retained by
Parent and not otherwise paid hereunder.

(iv) _Dissenting Shares_.

(A) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
eligible under Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") to exercise
appraisal rights and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and
properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262 and
complies in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 and has
not effectively withdrawn or lost the right to demand relief as a dissenting
stockholder under the DGCL as of the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive Merger Consideration pursuant to in _Section 2.7(b)(i)_, and the
holder or holders of such shares

 



-16-   shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or
holders in Section 262\. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section
2.7(b)(iv)_, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal under
Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then, as of the
later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)(i)_, without interest, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

(B) The Company shall (1) comply with the requirements of Section 262, (2)
give Parent prompt notice of any written demand received by the Company
pursuant to Section 262, of withdrawals of such demands, and provide copies
of any documents or instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (3) give Parent the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time of the Merger with
respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to
such payment or settlement offer.

 

(C) Any amount paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any
Person with respect to Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 in excess of

Share (following the Effective Time, such amount, unless determined in a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court, shall be subject to the written
approval of the Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and all interest, costs, expenses and fees
as incurred by the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the exercise of all rights under Section 262, shall constitute "Damages"

recover such Damages from the Escrow Fund.

(c) _Vested Company Options, Unvested Equity Awards and Company Warrants_.

unexercised Vested Company Option shall, by virtue of the Merger, be

Option Consideration less (x) the amounts that Parent is entitled to withhold

payment for the repurchase of any Unvested Company Capital Stock held by any
Non-Continuing Employee, which shall be repurchased by the Company in
accordance with _Section 6.14(a)_ pursuant to their existing terms and
conditions upon the termination of employment, or consulting or advisory
services of the impacted Employee).

 



-17-  (B) _Continuing Employees_.

 

(1) At the Effective Time, the vesting with respect to each then outstanding
Unvested Equity Award held by an Employee who, effective immediately after
the Closing, will be a Continuing Employee, shall be accelerated such that
effective immediately prior to the Closing such Unvested Equity Awards shall
vest as to that number of shares that would have otherwise vested as of March
31, 2011 if all other conditions to vesting had been satisfied as of such
date.

(2) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each then outstanding
Unvested Equity Award that is not accelerated pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)(ii)(B)(1)_ held by an Employee who, effective immediately after the
Closing, will be a Continuing Employee shall, in the case of Unvested Company
Options, be cancelled pursuant to their terms and, in the case of Unvested
Company Capital Stock, be cancelled pursuant to their terms and this _Section
2.7(c)(ii)(B)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall provide each
Continuing Employee who, as of the Effective Time, held any Unvested Company
Options or shares of Unvested Company Capital Stock, subject to (1) surrender
of the certificate or agreement representing such Unvested Equity Award, (2)
the terms set forth in, and the execution and delivery of, such Continuing
Employees Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan Agreement, (3) the continued
employment of the Unvested Equity Awardholder with Parent or a
Subsidiary thereof, and (4) such other terms set forth in the Continuing
Employee Unvested Cash Plan, an amount of cash from the Continuing Employee
Pool, without interest, equal to: (x) with respect to Unvested Company
Options, the Option Consideration, and (y) with respect to shares of Unvested
Company Capital Stock, the Per Share Consideration multiplied by the number of
shares of Unvested Company Capital Stock subject to the applicable Unvested
Equity Award, in each case less the amounts that Parent is entitled to
withhold pursuant to _Sections 2.8(b)_ and _2.8(c)_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 2.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, any portion of the Continuing Employee Pool to which a
Company Securityholder is entitled at the Effective Time shall be payable to
such Company Securityholder only in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan Agreement to which such Company
Securityholder is a party. Except (aa) as contemplated by the terms and
conditions of the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan and (bb) as provided
in _Section 2.8(b)_, the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement in exchange for Company Securities that constitute Unvested
Equity Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be subject to the
same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such shares
of Unvested Equity Awards immediately prior to or at the Effective Time.
Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee who, as of the Effective Time,
held Company Option Commitment, subject to (1) the terms set forth in, and the
execution and delivery of, such Continuing Employees Company Option
Commitment Letter and (2) the continued employment of the Continuing Employee
with Parent or a Subsidiary thereof, an amount of cash from the Company Option
Commitment Pool, without interest, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Consideration over the deemed per share exercise price of such Company
Option Commitment as specified on Schedule 1.1(m) less (x) the amounts that
Parent is entitled to withhold to fund the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section
2.8(b)_ and (y) the amounts that Parent is entitled to withhold to fund the
Representative Expense Fund pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_. Any amount payable
to a Company Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Unvested
Equity Awards shall not be paid by Parent or the Paying Agent at the Effective
Time and shall instead be paid by Parent or the Paying Agent (directly or
indirectly, including through a payroll processor) to such Company
Securityholder only after the date that such Unvested Equity Awards would have
become vested or released from the Companys repurchase right under the
applicable vesting schedule in effect in respect of such Unvested Equity
Awards immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the
restrictions

 



-18-   and other terms of such vesting schedule), less the amounts with respect
thereto withheld by Parent or deposited into the Escrow Fund in accordance
with _Section 2.8(b)_ or the Representative Expense Fund pursuant to
_Section 2.8(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
set forth herein or in the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan or any
Company Option Commitment Letter, Parent shall be entitled to pay all cash
amounts that become payable pursuant to this _Section 2.7(c)(ii)_ in respect
of Unvested Equity Awards that vest during each calendar quarter following the
Effective Time on Parents first regularly-scheduled payroll date of the
calendar quarter immediately following the vesting date of such Unvested
Equity Awards, subject to the terms and conditions of the Continuing Employee
Unvested Cash Plan Agreement or Company Option Commitment Letter,
as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Continuing Employee will
forfeit any amount earned as a result of his or her continuing service as a
result of the foregoing quarterly payment structure. Each Continuing Employee
Unvested Cash Plan Agreement or Company Option Commitment Letter, as
applicable, shall provide that any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement
to a Continuing Employee who is a party to such Continuing Employee Unvested
Cash Plan Agreement or Company Option Commitment Letter, as applicable, shall
be (A) withheld by Parent (and constitute a portion of the Continuing Employee
Pool or the Company Option Commitment Pool, as applicable) in order to secure
Parents repurchase rights or such Continuing Employees vesting provisions
applicable to such Continuing Employees Unvested Equity Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) upon payment to such
Continuing Employee, subject to withholding by Parent pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, including _Sections 2.8(b)(ii)_ and
_2.8(f)_ , and shall be paid without interest.

(iii) _Company Warrants_. No outstanding Company Warrants, if any, shall be
assumed by Parent, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each such Company Warrant to be either (i) exercised by the holder of
such Company Warrant in full or (ii) to the extent not exercised in full,
terminated or cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, either
pursuant to their own terms or pursuant to an agreement with the holder
thereof.

(iv) _Necessary Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the
review and approval of Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions anticipated by this _Section 2.7_ under the
Company Stock Plans, all agreements evidencing Company Option, all agreements
evidencing Company Warrant and any other plan or arrangement of the Company
(whether written or oral, formal or informal), including delivering all
required notices and obtaining any required consents, such that at the
Effective Time the Company shall not have any outstanding equity interests
other than shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Options outstanding.

2.8 _Payment Procedures_.

(a) _Closing Payment Fund_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (but, in any event, within one Business Day following the Closing Date),
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association (the " _Paying Agent_ ") an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ (such funds being
referred to herein as the " _Closing Payment Fund_ "). All funds held from
time to time in the Closing Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with the terms hereof. All interest and
other earnings from any investment of funds held from time to time in the
Closing Payment Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and
no part of such interest or other earnings shall accrue to or for the benefit
of any Company Securityholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that the Closing Payment 

 



-19-   Fund is insufficient to make the aggregate payments contemplated by _Section
2.7(b)_, Parent shall promptly deposit additional cash into the Closing
Payment Fund in an amount sufficient to make all such payments on a timely
basis.

(b) _Escrow Fund_. All amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant
to this Section 2.8(b) are referred to in the aggregate as the " _Escrow
Fund_."

(i) _Vested Company Capital Stock and Vested Company Options_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to withhold from the aggregate Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to the Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section 2.7
_in respect of Vested Company Capital Stock and Vested Company Options an
amount of cash equal in the aggregate to the Vested Escrow Amount. The Vested
Escrow Amount shall be withheld from each such Company Securityholder in
accordance with such Company Securityholders Escrow Percentage attributable
to such Company Securityholders Vested Company Capital Stock and Vested
Company Options. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but, in
any event, within one Business Day following the Closing Date), Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash
equal to the Vested Escrow Amount. The Vested Escrow Amount shall be held
and distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Vested Escrow Amount as partial
security for the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Vested Escrow
Amount (or any portion thereof) shall be distributed at the times and upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(ii) _Unvested Equity Awards_. With respect to any amounts paid to a Company
Securityholder pursuant to  _Section 2.7(c)(ii)(B)_ or the Continuing
Employee Unvested Cash Plan or from the Company Option Commitment Pool
pursuant to a Company Option Commitment Letter, from the Effective Time until
the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to
withhold from such amount an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Percentage of
such amount (any such amounts, an " _Unvested Escrow Amount_ "). Parent may
withhold any Unvested Escrow Amount or, in its sole discretion deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent any Unvested Escrow Amount. To
the extent applicable, following the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
from any amounts paid to a Company Securityholder pursuant to  _Section
2.7(c)(ii)(B)_ , the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan or from the
Company Option Commitment Pool pursuant to a Company Option Commitment Letter,
Parent shall be entitled to withhold all or any portion of such
amount necessary to satisfy such Company Securityholders indemnification
obligations with respect to any Outstanding Claim (as such term is defined in
the Escrow Agreement), which amounts may, at Parents option, be deposited
with the Escrow Agent. Any amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant
to this _Section 2.8(b)(ii)_ shall be held and distributed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, and upon any such deposit
with the Escrow Agent, Parent shall provide written notice thereof to the
Representative, identifying the Company Securityholder to which such deposit
relates and the corresponding deposit amount. The Escrow Agent shall hold any
amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section
2.8(b)(ii)_ as partial security for the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
herein. Any amounts (or any portion thereof) deposited with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this _Section 2.8(b)(ii)_ shall be distributed at the times and
upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not
be entitled to withhold more than the Unvested Escrow Adjustment in the
aggregate from all such Company Securityholders pursuant to this _Section
2.8(b)(ii)_.

 



-20-  (iii) _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any payment to
the Company Securityholders other than holders of Equity Awards of any
portion of the Escrow Amount will be treated as deferred contingent purchase
price eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code
and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local law, as
appropriate, and will be subject to imputation of interest under Section 483
or Section 1274 of the Code. Any interest and earnings on the Vested Escrow
Amount will be included in the gross income of Parent pursuant to Section
468B(g) of the Code. In no event shall the total amount of the Vested Escrow
Amount, including any interest and earnings thereon, to be paid to the Company
Securityholders under this Agreement exceed an amount to be designated
pursuant to this Agreement, which is intended to ensure that the right of the
Company Securityholders to any such payments is not treated as a contingent
payment without a stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall take a position in any Tax Return or examination or other
administrative or judicial proceeding (including any ruling request) relating
to any Tax that is inconsistent with such treatment, except as otherwise
required by a Taxing Authority. Any payment of any portion of the Vested
Escrow Amount to a holder of Equity Awards will be treated as compensation
reportable on Forms W-2 to be issued by the Company and includable in gross
income of such holder at the time of payment.

(c) _Representative Expense Fund_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to withhold from the
aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each Company
Securityholder pursuant to _Section 2.7_ an amount of cash equal to the
Representative Expense Amount. The Representative Expense Amount shall be
withheld from each such Company Securityholder in accordance with such Company
Securityholders Pro Rata Share. As soon as practicable following
the Effective Time (but, in any event, within one Business Day following the

pursuant to this Agreement. The Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses

Effective Time, until such Unvested Equity Awardholders entire contribution
to the Representative Expense Fund (in respect of all Company Securities held
by such Unvested Equity Awardholder, whether vested or unvested) has
been withheld and deposited into the Representative Expense Fund. Thereafter,
any amounts payable to such Unvested Equity Awardholder under this Agreement
shall be withheld and deposited into the Representative Expense Fund by Parent
if and only to the extent necessary to satisfy such Unvested Equity
Awardholders entire Representative Expense Fund contribution obligation under
this Agreement (with the understanding and agreement that any amounts so
deposited into the Representative Expense Fund on behalf of any such

 



-21-   Unvested Equity Awardholder shall vest prior to any amounts payable under
this Agreement in respect of any Unvested Equity Award held by such Unvested
Equity Awardholder that is not so deposited into the Representative Expense
Fund). The Representative Expense Amount shall be held and distributed in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Representative shall
hold the Representative Expense Fund as partial security for
the reimbursement obligations of the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Company Securityholders shall
not receive interest or other earnings on the Representative Expense Fund and
the Company Securityholders irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Representative any ownership right that they may have in any interest that may
accrue on funds held in the Representative Expense Fund. The Company
Securityholders acknowledge that the Representative is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The Representative shall
have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the

willful misconduct.

(d) _Exchange Procedures_. Subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement: 

(i) As soon as commercially practicable after the Effective Time (and, within
two Business Days following the Closing Date if the Payment Spreadsheet is
delivered in accordance with _Section 6.9(a)_), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each Company Stockholder a letter of
transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit F_ (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") to the address set forth opposite such Company
Stockholders name on the Payment Spreadsheet. After receipt of such Letter of
Transmittal, such Company Stockholder shall surrender the certificates
representing his, her or its shares of the Company Capital Stock (the "
_Company Stock Certificates_ ") to the Paying Agent for cancellation together
with duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal (it being
understood that certificates representing Company Preferred Stock that has
been converted or that has been deemed converted to Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall suffice for this purpose).
Upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificates and Letter of Transmittal,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to receive
from the Paying Agent as soon as commercially practicable thereafter (but, in
any event, within three Business Days following receipt by the Paying Agent
of such Company Stock Certificates and Letter of Transmittal in good order),
by delivery of a check or by such other payment mechanism approved by Parent
in its reasonable discretion (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
Companys 10 largest stockholders and their Affiliates (calculated on a fully
diluted, as converted to Company Common Stock basis) will be entitled to
request payment by means of a wire transfer from the Paying Agent), the cash
constituting the portion of the Closing Payment Fund to which such Company
Stockholder is entitled less any applicable Tax withholding. The Company Stock
Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until so surrendered,
after the Effective Time, subject to appraisal rights under the DGCL, each
Company Stock Certificate will be deemed, for all corporate purposes
thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the consideration provided
for in this Agreement. No portion of the Closing Payment Fund shall be paid
to any Company Stockholder unless and until the holder of record of such
Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and
the Letter of Transmittal pursuant hereto.

 

(ii) As soon as commercially practicable after the Closing Date, and upon
receipt by the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, of such documents that
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably require (which documents shall be
substantially similar to the Letter of Transmittal) in order to effect the
payment of the portion of the Closing Payment Fund with respect of Vested
Company Options, each holder of Vested Company Options shall be entitled to
receive from the Paying Agent or Parent (directly or indirectly, including
through a payroll

 



-22-   processor), as applicable, the portion of the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)(i)_, less any applicable
Tax withholding.

 

(iii) As soon as commercially practicable after the Effective Time, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of
Unvested Equity Awards who is a Continuing Employee a copy of the Continuing
Employee Unvested Cash Plan, a Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan
Agreement and such other documents as may be reasonably required by
Parent (collectively, the " _Unvested Equity Award Documents_ "). Each holder
of Unvested Equity Awards who is a Continuing Employee shall be responsible
for delivering to Parent his or her executed Unvested Equity Award Documents,
together with the certificate(s) or agreement(s) representing his or her
cancelled Unvested Equity Awards after the Closing. Subject to the receipt by
Parent of such Unvested Equity Award Documents and the terms and conditions of
the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan and such holders Continuing
Employee Unvested Cash Plan Agreement, such holder of Unvested Equity Awards
shall be entitled to receive from Parent out of the Continuing Employee Pool
the payments that such holder is eligible to receive pursuant to _Section
2.7(c)(ii)(B) _(without interest and less any applicable Tax withholding). The
payments made to the holders of Unvested Equity Awards pursuant to their
Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan Agreements shall be subject to
applicable income or employment Tax withholding as required under the Code or
any provision of applicable Tax Law. No payments shall be made to the holder
of any Unvested Equity Awards who is a Continuing Employee in connection
with the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan unless and until such holder
shall have delivered to Parent the Unvested Equity Award Documents and any
other documents that Parent may reasonably require pursuant thereto.

 

(iv) If payment of any portion of the applicable Closing Payment Fund is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company
Securities are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person
requesting such payment (A) shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Company Securities surrendered, and shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid, or (B)
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not
applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.7_, each certificate or agreement formerly
representing Company Securities shall be deemed to represent for all purposes
only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, if any, in
respect of such Company Securities formerly represented thereby in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and in the manner provided herein.

 

(e) _Termination of Closing Payment Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it all or any portion of the Closing Payment Fund
(including any earnings received with respect thereto) that has not
been disbursed to holders of Company Securities, and thereafter such holders
of Company Securities shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law), and only as general
creditors thereof, with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a certificate or agreement formerly representing
Company Securities for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Securities two years after
the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the

 



-23-   extent permitted by applicable Law, including any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Law in respect of Taxes or under any
applicable Law, and to request and be provided any necessary and validly
executed Tax forms, including valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or the
appropriate version of Form W-8, as applicable, and any similar information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any payment to any Person is
not reduced by such deductions or withholdings, such Person shall indemnify
Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) for any amounts imposed by and paid over to any Taxing Authority
with respect to any such Taxes, together with any costs and expenses relating
thereto (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation). To
the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld pursuant to this
_Section 2.8(f)_, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. All sales, use, value-added, goods and services,
gross receipts, excise, registration, recording, stamp duty, transfer or other
similar Taxes or governmental fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed or levied
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne by the party on whom such tax is assessed.

certificate(s) which formerly represented shares of Company Capital Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the Company Stockholder in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (a " _Lost Stock Affidavit_ "), Parent shall instruct
the Paying Agent to pay such Company Stockholder the portion of the Merger
Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled to pursuant to
_Section 2.7(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its sole
discretion (acting in good faith) and as a condition precedent to
issuing such instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification
in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed (the " _Lost
Certificate Indemnity Agreement_ ").

2.9 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of
the shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. After the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall cancel and
exchange, as provided in this _Section 2.9_, any presented certificate
representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

2.10 _Taking of Further Necessary Action_. Each of Parent, the Company
and the Representative will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance
with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and

franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time are and will remain fully authorized
in the name of the Company or otherwise to take, and shall take, upon request
by Parent, all such lawful and necessary action.

Subsidiaries have transferred or assigned any interest in any Real Property
Lease, nor have they subleased or otherwise granted rights of use or occupancy

business status" in the application for or registration of any Company
Registered Intellectual Property, nor any other status that, to the Knowledge
of the Company, would not be applicable to Parent or the Surviving Company. To
the Knowledge of the Company, there is no information, materials, facts or
circumstances, including any information or fact that would constitute prior
art not in the file wrapper, that would render any of the Company Registered
Intellectual Property that is not an application invalid or unenforceable, or
would adversely affect any pending application for any Company Registered
Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have
misrepresented, or failed to disclose, any facts or circumstances known to it

Company Intellectual Property, including Company Registered Intellectual

finding will not be predicated on any act or omission by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, nor on any information or event about which the Company knew
or should have known. All necessary registration, maintenance and renewal
fees have been paid, and all necessary documents and certificates in
connection with such Company Registered Intellectual Property have been filed

otherwise violate any Intellectual Property or other proprietary right owned

Subsidiaries infringes, dilutes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates or

misappropriate, or otherwise violate or constitute the unauthorized use of,
the Intellectual Property of any third party (nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is there any basis therefor), nor has the Company received written
notice threatening any such Action (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
threat not in writing that is reasonably likely to result in any such Action).

moral rights) (including the right to seek past and future damages with
respect thereto) (in each case, which agreement does not materially differ in
form or substance, with respect to such Intellectual Property matters, from
the Companys standard forms which have been provided by Company to Parent)
under which such employee, consultant or independent contractor has not
retained and does not have any rights or licenses with respect to any such
Intellectual Property developed for the Company or its Subsidiaries or using
resources owned or provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Other than
under a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement or contractual provision
relating to confidentiality and non-disclosure, there has been no disclosure
to any third party of confidential information or Trade Secrets of the Company
related to any Company Product. Assignments of the Registered Intellectual

for any Company Product (including in any such case any conditional right to
access or under which the Company has established any escrow arrangement for
the storage and conditional release of any of its source code for any Company
Product). The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in a release of
any source code owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the grant
of incremental rights to a Person with regard to such source code. The source
code for all Company Products that include software has been documented in a
professional manner that is both: (i) consistent with customary code

(ii) sufficient to independently enable a programmer of reasonable skill and
competence to understand, analyze, and interpret program logic, correct errors
and improve, enhance, modify and support the Company Products. All Company

available to any third party by or for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) a reference to the applicable license terms for each such
item of Open Source Material, (C) the Company Product to which each such item
of Open Source Material relates, and (D) whether (and if so, in a general
manner, how) each such item of Open Source Material has been modified or

any of its Subsidiaries has used any Open Source Material in a manner
that grants or would require the grant of a license to any Person of any
Company Product (excepting such Open Source Materials themselves, as
unmodified in a material manner by Company) or Company Intellectual Property
or, in each case, any portion thereof. The Open Source Materials have not
been exploited in a manner that imposes or purports to impose a requirement or
condition that the Company Intellectual Property (or any portion thereof) be
(i) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (ii) licensed for the
purpose of making modifications or derivative works, or (iii) redistributable

reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.

of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or

injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any

representation or warranty set forth herein, the Disclosure Schedule or the

limit any right to indemnification provided herein.

applicable, by the terms and conditions of the Continuing Employee Unvested
Cash Plan and the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan Agreement, or the
Company Option Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, participation
in either of the Continuing Employee Unvested Cash Plan or the Company Option

reflects Taxes for which Parent will seek indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE

Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), Parent
shall provide the Representative with a copy of any such Tax Return that
reflects only operations and Taxes relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or a pro forma Tax Return reflecting only such operations and
Taxes. Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification for Taxes pursuant to

Tax Return that is not consistent with prior practice (unless required by
applicable Law) or (ii) making an election made under Section 338(g) of the
Code in connection with the Merger. Neither Parent nor the Company
shall amend, modify or otherwise change any such Pre-Closing Tax Return after
filing without the prior consent of the Representative if such amendment,
modification or change could give rise to an indemnification claim for Taxes
under  _ARTICLE 8_, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return for the affiliated group (within

its Subsidiaries will be filed for periods starting after the Closing Date.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the taxable year of the Company shall
close for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the end of the day on the

jurisdictions so permits, the taxable year of the Company shall close for
income Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date, and (iii) all
U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax Returns shall be filed
consistently on the foregoing basis.

 

(d) _Cooperation; Audits_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns,
audit examinations, and any proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which an indemnification claim
could be made pursuant to _ARTICLE 8_, Parent and the Company, on the one
hand, and the Representative and the Company Securityholders, on the other
hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including by furnishing or making
available during normal business hours the records, personnel (as reasonably
required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary
or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit
examinations or the defense of claims relating to such Taxes.

 

(e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Anything in any other agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
shall take all action necessary to cease and terminate any Tax allocation,
sharing or indemnity agreement or arrangement (other than between the Company
and any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) effective at the Effective
Time, and all obligations thereunder shall terminate and no additional
payments shall be made thereunder after the Effective Time, except with
respect to any claims in effect as of such termination.

Joinder Agreement entered into with such Indemnifying Party, or (3) for any
other claims or causes of action arising out of or relating to fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach under applicable Law.
Provided that it has complied with _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, any Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to bring claims directly against
any Company Securityholder in connection with any claims or causes of action
arising out of or relating to the Joinder Agreement of such Company
Securityholder and may recover any Damages directly or indirectly paid,
sustained or incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party directly from such
Company Securityholder in respect thereof.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
the Merger is consummated, (A) the Escrow Fund shall be the Parent Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive remedy, security and source of recovery for any
Indemnification Claims under and pursuant to clause (i) of _Section 8.2(a)_,
and (B) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any
Damages in respect of any Indemnification Claims under or pursuant to clause
(i) of _Section 8.2(a)_, in the aggregate, in excess of the funds held in
the Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the preceding
restrictions set forth in this  _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ shall not in any way
limit or otherwise restrict any right in respect of any Indemnification Claims
under or pursuant to clauses (ii) through (x) of _Section 8.2(a)_, inclusive,
or any other claims or causes of action arising out of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or intentional breach under applicable Law.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
if the Merger is consummated, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover any Damages from any Indemnifying Party in respect of any
Indemnification Claims under or pursuant to clause (ii) through (ix) of
_Section 8.2(a)_, inclusive, in the aggregate, in excess of an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration actually received by each Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the preceding restrictions set forth
in this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ shall not in any way limit or otherwise
restrict any right in respect of any Indemnification Claims against any
Indemnifying Party under or pursuant to clause (i) or (x) of _Section
8.2(a)_, or any other claims or causes of action arising out of fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach under applicable Law.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
Indemnified Party may receive cash from the Escrow Fund in respect of any
claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to clause (i) of _Section
8.2(a) _unless and until an Indemnified Party pays, suffers or accrues
Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount greater than One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case the Indemnified Party may
make claims for indemnification and may receive cash from the Escrow Fund for
all Indemnifiable Damages including the entire amount of the Threshold.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
if the Merger is consummated, Parent acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of
itself and all Parent Indemnified Parties) that all applicable statutes of
limitations or other claims periods

 



-77-   with respect to claims thereunder shall be shortened to the survival and
claims periods expressly set forth in _Section 8.1_.

 

(vi) All amounts required to be paid to a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to
the terms of this _ARTICLE 8 _shall be reduced by any amount actually
received by any Indemnified Party under any insurance policies (net of any
correspondent premium increase or related cost of obtaining such insurance
related payment); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall a Parent
Indemnified Party be required to seek recovery under any insurance policy.

(vii) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a particular matter
entitles a Parent Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to more than
one clause of _Section 8.2(a)_, such Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover a particular dollar of Damages associated with such
matter only once under this _ARTICLE 8_.

(viii) In the event that any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
indemnification under this _ARTICLE 8_ from all Indemnifying Parties, then
after the Parent Indemnified Parties have exhausted or made claims upon all
assets in the Escrow Fund, each Indemnifying Party shall be severally and not
jointly responsible and liable for its Pro Rata Share of the amount of such
indemnification obligation, not to exceed the portion of the Merger
Consideration actually received by such Company Securityholder; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not in any way limit or otherwise
restrict any right in respect of any claims or causes of action arising out of
or relating to fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach
under applicable Law. 

(ix) Indemnification claims may be made for Damages arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with indemnification claims under or pursuant to
clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 8.2(a)_ may be made at any time prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period applicable to the representation or warranty
that is the basis for such claim. Indemnification claims may be made for
Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with indemnification
claims under or pursuant to clauses (iii) through (ix), inclusive, of _Section
8.2(a)_ at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the
statute of limitations under applicable Law.

(c) _Indemnification Claims_. 

(i) If a Parent Indemnified Party is of the opinion that it has or may acquire
a right to indemnification under this  _ARTICLE 8_ (each, an "
_Indemnification Claim_ "), such Parent Indemnified Party shall so notify the
Representative in a written notice, signed by such Parent Indemnified Party,
or any officer thereof (each, an " _Officer s Certificate_") delivered on or
prior to the expiration of the Survival Period (or such longer period
applicable to such representation and warranty as set forth above): (i)
stating that such Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly paid,
sustained or incurred any Damages, or reasonably anticipates that it will
directly or indirectly pay, sustain or incur any Damages; (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Damages included in the amount so
stated (and the method of computation of each such item of Damages, if
applicable), the date each such item of Damages was paid, sustained or
incurred, or the basis for such reasonably anticipated Damages; (iii) a
brief description in reasonable detail (to the extent available to such
Parent Indemnified Party) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
each item of Damages based on such Parent Indemnified Partys good faith
belief thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party
claimant and copies of any formal demand or complaint relating thereto; and
(iv) the basis for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ to which such item of
Damages is related (including, if applicable, the specific nature of the
misrepresentation, or the breach of warranty or covenant). Following the
delivery of

 



-78-   an Officers Certificate, the Representative and its representatives and
agents shall, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, be given
access during normal business hours (including electronic access, to the
extent available) as they may reasonably require to the books and records of
the Surviving Corporation and access during normal business hours to such
personnel or representatives of the Surviving Corporation and Parent,
including the individuals responsible for the matters that are subject of the
Officers Certificate, as they may reasonably require for the purposes of
resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in
the Officers Certificate.

(ii) If the Representative shall not object in writing pursuant to  _Section
8.2(c)(iii)_ to any individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers
Certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ within 30
days after the Representatives receipt of such Officers Certificate, the
Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged and
irrevocably consented, for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, to the
Parent Indemnified Party recovery of the full amount of all such items of
Damages set forth in such Officers Certificate solely to the extent that
such Damages do not exceed the Escrow Fund at such time. Upon receipt of any
Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not release any portion of the
Escrow Fund to Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party or Parties
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement unless and until (i) the
Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Representative
to release any portion of the Escrow Fund, or (ii) the Representative shall
have failed to object in writing pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(iv)_ to any
individual items of Damages set forth in such Officers Certificate within 30
days after the Representatives receipt of such Officers Certificate.

(iii) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall receive written
authorization from the Representative to release to Parent or any other
Parent Indemnified Party or Parties any portion of the Escrow Fund pursuant to
_Section 8.2(c)(i)_, the Escrow Agent shall release such portion of the
Escrow Fund in accordance with such written instructions. In the event that
the Representative shall have failed to object in writing pursuant to _Section
8.2(c)(iv)_ to any individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers
Certificate relating to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2_ within 30 days after the Representatives receipt of such Officers
Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release to Parent or any other
Parent Indemnified Party or Parties (as instructed by Parent in writing) from
the Escrow Fund an amount of cash equal to the amount of all such items of
Damages specified in such Officers Certificate with respect to which the
Representative has not objected in writing pursuant to  _Section
8.2(c)(iv)_. Any cash released to Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party
or Parties pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be deemed to reduce each
Indemnifying Partys interest in the Escrow Fund in accordance with his, her
or its Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund.

(iv) In the event that the Representative shall seek to contest
any individual items of Damages set forth in an Officers Certificate
received from Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, the Representative
shall notify Parent in writing, within 30 days after receipt of such
Officers Certificate, of the Representatives objection, which notice shall
set forth a brief description in reasonable detail of the Representatives
basis for objecting to each item of Damages based on the Representatives good
faith belief thereof. Upon Parents receipt of a written notice of objection
from the Representative pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent and the
Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to the disputed items of Damages. If the
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth the
agreement reached by the parties with respect to such disputed items of
Damages shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely

 



-79-   on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the instructions set forth in any such memorandum.

 

(v) If within 60 days after the Representatives receipt of such Officers
Certificate, and after good faith negotiations, the parties are unable to
agree on the rights of the respective parties with respect to any disputed
items of Damages set forth in an Officers Certificate, either Parent or the
Representative may submit any such dispute for resolution pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 10.9_. The decision resulting therefrom shall be
nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and
the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.
Judgment upon any award rendered pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.9_
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 8.2(c)(v)_ shall be subject to
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) _Company Securityholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, the Company Organizational Documents or any agreement between the
Company and any Company Securityholder entered into prior to the Closing to
the contrary, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation, as the successor in
interest to the Company by virtue of the Merger, or Parent be obligated to
reimburse, contribute, indemnify or hold harmless any Company Securityholder
in its capacity as a Company Securityholder for or in connection with any
Damages or indemnification obligations of any Company Securityholder under
this  _ARTICLE 8_.

(e) _Third Party Actions_. In the event any Action is instituted against a
Parent Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely to
involve an Indemnification Claim hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), Parent
will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of the
commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Representative (or, in the
event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Party, such Indemnifying Party) of the commencement of any such Action will
relieve the Indemnifying Parties from liability in connection therewith only
if and to the extent that such failure materially and adversely affects
the ability of the Indemnifying Parties to defend their interests in such
Action. Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to control the
defense or settlement of such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) and its counsel
(at such partys sole expense) may participate in (but not control the conduct
of) the defense of such Action; and  _provided further_ that, except with the
consent of the Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying
Party), no settlement of any such Action with third party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Damages relating to such matter. In the event
that the Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Indemnifying
Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any provision
of this _ARTICLE 8_ to the amount of any such Indemnification Claim against
the Escrow Fund, or against the Indemnifying Parties directly, as the case may
be, with respect to such settlement.

 

(f) _Definition of Damages_. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the
term "Damages" shall mean the amount of (i) any direct, indirect,
consequential, incidental or other damage (including lost profits and
diminution in value), loss, liability, claim, deficiency, Tax, judgment, fine,
penalty, cost or other expense (including reasonable
attorneys, accountants, consultants and experts fees and expenses, and
any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing
of any Tax Return) directly or indirectly paid, sustained or incurred 

 



-80-   by the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them), (ii) any and all
reasonable fees and costs of enforcing the Parent Indemnified Partys rights
under this Agreement, and (iii) any and all reasonable fees and costs
defending any Third Party Actions that result in an indemnification payment
received by a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement. For
purposes of determining the amount of any Damage suffered or incurred by a
Parent Indemnified Party, any qualifications in the representations,
warranties and covenants with respect to a "Company Material Adverse Effect"
(which instead shall be read as any adverse effect or change, except in the
case of the reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect" in the first clause
of the introduction to _Section 3.8_, which shall continue to be read as
"Company Material Adverse Effect"), "materiality," "material" or similar
terms shall be disregarded and will not have any effect with respect to the
calculation of the amount of any Damages attributable to a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or the Company Bring-Down Certificate.

(g) _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Indemnifying Parties and
Parent agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to treat) any payments
received pursuant to _Section 8.2_ as adjustments to the Merger Consideration
for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

(h) _Effect of Investigation; Reliance_. The right to indemnification, payment
of Damages or any other remedy hereunder will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or any other remedy
based on any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Parent
Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation,
warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such Parent Indemnified
Party to be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

8.3 _Representative_.

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the Indemnifying Parties, by voting in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder, the consummation of
the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, and/or entering into a Joinder Agreement shall be deemed to have
approved the designation and appointment of, and hereby designates and
appoints, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Representative under
the terms set forth herein, and as his, her or its true and lawful agent,
proxy and attorney-in-fact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement on their behalf and exercise all or any of the powers,
authority and discretion conferred on the Representative under this Agreement.
Each Company Securityholder hereby agrees to receive correspondence from the
Representative, including in electronic form.

(b) _Powers of the Representative_. The Representative shall have and may
exercise all of the powers conferred upon him, her or it pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which shall include:

 

(i) The power to execute any agreement or instrument in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for and on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties;

 



-81-  (ii) The power to give or receive any notice or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any other
agreement, document or instrument entered into or executed in connection
herewith, to be given or received by any Indemnifying Party, and each of them
(other than notice for service of process relating to any Action before a
court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which notice must be given
to each Indemnifying Party individually, as applicable), and to take any and
all action for and on behalf of Indemnifying Parties, and each of them, under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other such agreement, document or
instrument;

(iii) The power (subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_ hereof) to
contest, negotiate, defend, compromise or settle any Indemnification Claims or
Actions for which a Parent Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification through counsel selected by the Representative and solely at
the cost, risk and expense of the Indemnifying Parties, authorize payment to
any Parent Indemnified Party of any of the Escrow Fund, or any portion
thereof, in satisfaction of any Indemnification Claims, agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such
Indemnification Claims, resolve any Indemnification Claims, take any actions
in connection with the resolution of any dispute relating hereto or to the
transactions contemplated hereby by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and
take or forego any or all actions permitted or required of any Indemnifying
Party or necessary in the judgment of the Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(iv) The power to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Parties;

 

(v) The power to review, negotiate and agree to and authorize any payments
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any payment obligation, in each case,
on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, as contemplated thereunder;

(vi) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Indemnifying Parties
(other than the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms hereof and in the manner provided herein); and 

(vii) The power to take any actions in regard to such other matters as are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and in the Escrow Agreement or as the Representative reasonably
believes are in the best interests of the Indemnifying Parties;

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth herein, the powers conferred above shall not authorize or
empower the Representative to do or cause to be done any of the foregoing (i)
in a manner that improperly discriminates between or among the Indemnifying
Parties; or (ii) as to any matter insofar as such matter relates solely and
exclusively to a single Indemnifying Party, whereupon the Representative may
appoint the Indemnifying Party who is alleged to be in breach to handle all
matters related to such indemnification claim on behalf of the Representative,
and all references to the Representative in such event shall include also
such Indemnifying Party. Without implying that other actions would constitute
an improper discrimination, each of the Indemnifying Parties agrees that
discrimination between or among Indemnifying Parties solely on the basis of
the respective number of shares of Company Capital

 



-82-   Stock held by each Company Stockholder shall not be deemed to be improper.
Further, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Representative
shall not be entitled to, and shall not, take any action that would (i) cause
any Indemnifying Partys liability to Parent hereunder to exceed its portion
of the Escrow Fund, (ii) result in the amounts payable hereunder to any
Indemnifying Party being distributed in any manner other than as set forth in
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (iii) result in an increase of any
Indemnifying Partys indemnity with respect to Parent or other obligations
with respect to Parent or liabilities with respect to Parent under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any change to the nature of
the indemnity obligations with respect to Parent), without (in each case) such
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

 

(c) _Procedures Upon Receipt of Indemnification Claims_. The Representative
shall have the discretion to take such action as he, she or it shall
determine to be in the best interest of all of the Indemnifying Parties,
including authorizing the distribution to any Parent Indemnified Party of any
portion of the Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in any event,
all Indemnifying Parties are treated in substantially the same manner.

(d) _Notices_. After the Effective Time, any notice given to the
Representative will constitute notice to each and all of the Indemnifying
Parties at the time notice is given to the Representative. After the Effective
Time, any action taken by, or notice or instruction received from,
the Representative will be deemed to be action by, or notice or instruction
from, each and all of the Indemnifying Parties. Except as otherwise contained
herein, after the Effective Time Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard any notice or
instruction received from any one or more individual Indemnifying Parties.

 

(e) _Agreement of the Representative_. The Representative hereby agrees to do
such acts, and execute further documents, as shall be reasonably necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(f) _Reimbursement and Liability of the Representative_.

(i) At the Closing, the Representative Expense Amount shall be deducted from
the amounts due to each holder of Company Securities pursuant to _Section
2.8(c)_ and transferred to the Representative to be held in a segregated
client funds account, as an expense fund to cover such reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Representative in the performance of his or
her duties hereunder. Any remaining funds not used by the Representative shall
be paid to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company Securityholders
contributing to such fund, based on each Company Securityholders Pro Rata
Share, upon conclusion of the Representatives duties hereunder. However, in
any event (and particularly in the event that the Representative Expense Fund
is not sufficient to cover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Representative in the performance of his, her or its duties hereunder),
each Indemnifying Party agrees that such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Share
of such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that are not covered by the
Representative Expense Fund may be deducted by the Representative from amounts
to be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties from the Escrow Fund prior to
delivery of such amounts to the Indemnifying Parties.

 

(ii) The Representative shall not be personally liable as the Representative
to any Indemnifying Party for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Representative other than such actions or omissions to act attributable to
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



-83-  (iii) The Company Securityholders (other than Parent) shall severally, but not
jointly based on their Pro Rata Share, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Representative and its successors and assigns from and against any and all
claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages,
obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
court costs) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising as a result
of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
the Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case as
such Representative Loss is incurred or suffered; _provided_ that in the event
that it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any portion
thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Representative, the Representative will reimburse the Company
Securityholders (other than Parent) the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative by the Company
Securityholders (other than Parent), any such losses, liabilities or expenses
may be recovered by the Representative from (A) the funds in the
Representative Expense Fund and (B) the amounts in the Escrow Account
otherwise distributable to Company Securityholders (other than Parent)
pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of each
distribution in accordance with written instructions delivered by the
Representative to the Escrow Agent; _provided_ that while this section allows
the Representative to be paid from the Representative Expense Fund and the
Escrow Account, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as to
relieve the Company Securityholders (other than Parent) from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as such Representative Losses are
suffered or incurred, nor to prevent the Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

(iv) In connection with the Closing, the Company shall provide the
Representative with copies of the following: (A) the Company Bring-Down
Certificate; (B) the Unvested Equity Award Documents; and (C) the Payment
Spreadsheet.

8.4 _Reliance on the Representative_. Parent and its Affiliates (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on the appointment of Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as Representative and treat such Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying Party and as having the
duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. None of Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or the Escrow Agent shall be liable
to any Indemnifying Party for any actions taken or omitted by them in reliance
upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by the
Representative. No resignation of the Representative shall become effective
unless at least 30 days prior written notice of the resignation of such
Representative shall be provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Parent and
its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely at any time after
receipt of any such notice on the most recent notice so received.
The Indemnifying Parties holding a majority interest in the Escrow Fund held
in escrow at such time may remove the Representative by a written instrument
delivered to the Representative, Parent and the Company, and, in such event
and also if the Representative shall resign or be unable or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, his, her or its successor who shall serve and exercise
the powers of the Representative hereunder shall be appointed by a written
instrument signed by Indemnifying Parties holding a majority interest in the
Escrow Fund held in escrow at such time and delivered to Parent and the Escrow
Agent.

8.5 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after Closing, except for equitable
remedies or in the event of fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation, the rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
strictly limited to those contained in this _ARTICLE 8_ and such
indemnification rights shall be 

 



-84-   the exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Closing
Date with respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or
arising in connection herewith. Except in the event of fraud, willful breach
or intentional misrepresentation, or as provided in this _ARTICLE 8_, no
action shall be brought or maintained by any party against any Indemnifying
Party, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any Indemnifying
Party, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement or omission
respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of any of the Company or any Indemnifying Party set
forth or contained in this Agreement or the Company Bring-Down Certificate.

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Closing Date shall not have
occurred by August 1, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any of the conditions specified in _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not have
been satisfied on or prior to such date, either Parent or the Company may

the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not

cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such

otherwise prohibits or otherwise restrains the consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any Governmental
Authority shall have issued or granted a restraining order, injunction, or
other similar legal restraint, in any such case that has the effect of making
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
otherwise prohibits or otherwise restrains the consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and such order,
injunction or restraint shall have become final and nonappealable;

(d) by Parent, if any Governmental Authority shall have taken any action, or
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced, entered or deemed applicable to the

covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement such that,
if not cured on or prior to the Closing Date, the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach has not
been cured within 20 days after written notice thereof to the Company;

 



-85-    _provided_ , _however_ , that no cure period shall be required for a breach
which by its nature cannot be cured, or (ii) a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred following the date hereof;

(f) by the Company, if there has been a breach of any representation,

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or their respective officers, directors or stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement, following any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, any party hereto shall remain liable thereafter for any fraud or any
intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach of this Agreement
that occurred prior to such termination; and _provided further_ that the
provisions of _Section 6.7 (Confidentiality)_, _Section 6.8 (Public

9.3 _Amendments; No Waiver_. Subject to applicable Law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 9.3_, the Company
Securityholders agree that any amendment or waiver of the Agreement signed by
the Representative shall be binding upon and effective against each of
the Company Securityholders whether or not they have signed such amendment or
waiver. No course of dealing and no failure or delay on the part of any party
hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such partys rights,
powers and remedies. The failure of any of the parties to this Agreement to
require the performance of a term or obligation under this Agreement or the
waiver by any of the parties to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall
not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a
waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single or partial exercise of
any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

Any party or other recipient may from time to time change its address for
purposes of this Agreement by giving notice of such change as provided herein.
Any notice to be given to any Indemnifying Party hereunder shall be given to
the Representative or, if for any reason there ceases to be a Representative,
to each Indemnifying Party.

10.2 _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and agreements and other
provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the
parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs
and permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the
parties may assign or transfer any of their respective rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent in writing of the Company, Parent
and the Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit Parent from merging the Surviving Company with
and into Parent or assigning any of the rights hereunder to a direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent following the Effective Time.

10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the different
parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

10.4 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
parties rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, and any such invalidity, illegality
and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party).

10.5 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions (without proof of damages) to prevent breaches
of

 



-88-   this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity and the parties hereby agree to waive any requirements for
posting a bond in connection with any such action.

10.6 _Other Remedies_. Except to the extent set forth otherwise herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

10.7 _Third Parties_. Except as specifically set forth or referred to herein,
nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or any other certificate, document, instrument or agreement
executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among
the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto in accordance
with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and are not
necessarily intended as characterization of actual facts or circumstances as
of the date of this Agreement or as of any earlier date. Without limiting
anything else in this _Section 10.7_, the representations and warranties made
in this Agreement are not intended to, and do not, confer upon any Person
(other than, to the extent expressly permitted, such Persons assignees) any
rights or remedies hereunder.

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and the
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state (without giving
effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof).

10.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Binding Arbitration_. Without limiting the
other provisions of this _Section 10.9_, the parties hereto agree that any
legal proceeding by or against any party hereto or with respect to or arising
out of this Agreement shall be arbitrated in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware pursuant to the arbitration proceedings set out in 10 Del.
C. § 349 and the Court of Chancery Rules relating thereto, including Court of
Chancery Rules 96, 97, and 98;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any legal
proceeding by or against any party hereto or with respect to or arising out of
this Agreement, if any, that is not eligible for arbitration in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to the arbitration proceedings set
out in 10 Del. C. § 349 shall be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware). The parties agree that the
decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding and not subject to
appeal. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for the purposes of
disputes arising under the this Agreement and not as a general submission to
such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter or claim
whatsoever. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of process
out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by
the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such
party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process
shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. The parties
hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding
under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the foregoing courts
on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that it or any of
its property is immune from the above-described legal process,

 



-89-   (ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that venue for the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any other defense that would
hinder or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any
party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

 

10.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule
(and all exhibits and schedules thereto) and all Exhibits and Schedules to
this Agreement, and all other agreements referred to herein (including the
Escrow Agreement) is complete, and all promises, representations,
understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to the subject
matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement relied
upon by all the parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such
Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other agreements and this
Agreement, including such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such
other agreements supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, to the extent that
they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

 

10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
