Article I _ 
 MERGER_

  

1.1   _Merger_. At the Effective Time, immediately following the
consummation of the Share Exchange, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the NRS, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger,
pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Purchaser with
Purchaser being the surviving entity, following which the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Purchaser shall continue as the
surviving corporation. Purchaser, as the surviving corporation after the
Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_
" (provided, that references to Purchaser for periods after the Effective
Time shall include the Surviving Corporation).

  

1.2   _Effective Time_. Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing (i) Articles of Merger (the " _Articles of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the NRS and (ii) a Certificate of Merger (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Purchaser (the time of such filings, or such later time as may be specified
in the Articles of Merger, and the Certificate of Merger, being the "
_Effective Time_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Effective Time shall in
all events be after the time at which the Share Exchange has been consummated
in accordance with _Article II_.

  

1.3   _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger,
the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the NRS and the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations
of Merger Sub and Purchaser shall become the property, rights, privileges,
agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations
of the Surviving Corporation (including all rights and obligations with
respect to the Trust Account), which shall include the assumption by the
Surviving Corporation of any and all agreements, covenants, duties and
obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement to be
performed after the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall
continue its existence as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Pubco.

  

1.4   _Organizational Documents of Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub,
each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease. The
Articles of Incorporation of Purchaser, as amended and restated prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with this Section 1.4, and the Bylaws of
Purchaser, both as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become the respective Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Parties agree to
negotiate in good faith (i) a mutually acceptable amended and restated
Articles of Incorporation and (ii) a mutually acceptable amended and restated
Bylaws of Purchaser, both in customary forms suitable for a wholly-owned
subsidiary of a publicly listed U.S. company. The amended and restated
Articles of Incorporation of Purchaser shall be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Nevada and shall be effective prior to the filing and
the effectiveness of the Articles of Merger.

1.5   _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the board of directors and executive officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be such directors and officers of the Company as
designated by the Company, each to hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

  

1.6   _Effect of Merger on Issued Securities of Purchaser_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party or the holders of securities of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub:

  

(a)   _Purchaser Units_. At the Effective Time, every issued
and outstanding Purchaser Unit shall be automatically detached and the holder
thereof shall be deemed to hold one share of Purchaser Common Stock, one
Purchaser Warrant and one Purchaser Right in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Purchaser Unit, which underlying Purchaser Securities shall be
converted in accordance with the applicable terms of this _Section 1.6_ below.

  

(b)   _Purchaser Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, every
issued and outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock (other than those
described in _Section 1.6(f)_ below) shall be converted automatically into one
Pubco Class A Ordinary Share, following which, all shares of Purchaser Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist. The holders of certificates previously evidencing shares
of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as provided
herein or by Law. Each certificate previously evidencing shares of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be exchanged for a certificate (if requested) representing
the same number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with _Section 1.7_. Each certificate formerly
representing shares of Purchaser Common Stock (other those described in
_Section 1.6(f)_  below) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the same number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares.

  

(c)   _Purchaser Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, every
issued and outstanding share of Purchaser Preferred Stock (other than those
described in _Section 1.6(f)_ below), if any, shall be converted
automatically into one Pubco Preferred Share, following which, all shares of
Purchaser Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist. The holders of
certificates previously evidencing shares of Purchaser Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as provided herein or by Law. Each
certificate previously evidencing shares of Purchaser Preferred Stock shall be
exchanged for a certificate representing the same number of Pubco Preferred
Shares upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
_Section 1.7_. Each certificate formerly representing shares of Purchaser
Preferred Stock (other those described in _Section 1.6(f)_  below) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the same number of Pubco
Preferred Shares.

  

(d)   _Purchaser Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Purchaser Public Warrant shall be converted into one Pubco Public
Warrant and each outstanding Purchaser Private Warrant shall be converted into
one Pubco Private Warrant. At the Effective Time, the Purchaser Warrants
shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist. Each of the Pubco Public Warrants shall have, and be
subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the
Purchaser Public Warrants, and each of the Pubco Private Warrants shall have,
and be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in
the Purchaser Private Warrants, except that in each case they shall
represent the right to acquire Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares in lieu of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time, Pubco
shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for future issuance, and
shall maintain such reservation for so long as any of the Pubco Warrants
remain outstanding, a sufficient number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares for
delivery upon the exercise of such Pubco Warrants.

  

(e)   _Purchaser Rights_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding Purchaser Right shall be automatically converted into the
number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares that would have been received by the
holder thereof if such Purchaser Right had been converted upon the
consummation of a Business Combination in accordance with Purchaser's
Organizational Documents, the IPO Prospectus and the Rights Agreement into
shares of Purchaser Common Stock, but for such purposes treating it as if such
Business Combination had occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Purchaser
Rights had then automatically been converted into Pubco Class A Ordinary
Shares in accordance with _Section 1.6(b)_ above. At the Effective Time, the
Purchaser Rights shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. The holders of certificates
previously evidencing Purchaser Rights outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Purchaser
Rights, except as provided herein or by Law. Each certificate formerly
representing Purchaser Rights shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares as set forth herein.

  

(f)   _Cancellation of Capital Stock Owned by Purchaser_. At
the Effective Time, if there are any shares of capital stock of Purchaser
that are owned by Purchaser as treasury shares, such shares shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  

(g)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for
securities of Purchaser is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for securities of Purchaser in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

(h)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 1.6_ , none of the Surviving Corporation, Pubco or any other
Party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

1.7   _Effect of Merger on Merger Sub and Pubco Capital Shares_.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any Party or any equityholder of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub:
(a) all of the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an equal
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and
(b) all of the shares of Pubco issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or payment therefor.

  

1.8   _Surrender of Purchaser Certificates_. All securities issued
upon the surrender of Purchaser Securities in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such securities, provided that any restrictions on the sale and
transfer of Purchaser Securities shall also apply to the Pubco Securities so
issued in exchange.

1.9   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Purchaser Certificates_. In the
event any certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Pubco shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, as the
case may be, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such securities, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.6_ ;
_provided_ , however, that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

1.10   _Tax Consequences_. The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge
that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Merger and the Share
Exchange, taken together, are intended to qualify as an exchange described in
Section 351 of the Code. The Parties hereby agree to file all Tax and other
informational returns on a basis consistent with such characterization unless
otherwise required pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code. Each of the Parties acknowledge and agree that each (i)
has had the opportunity to obtain independent legal and Tax advice with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) is
responsible for paying its own Taxes, including any adverse Tax consequences
that may result if the Merger and the Share Exchange, taken together, does
not qualify under Section 351 of the Code.

  

1.11   _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Purchaser and Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of Purchaser and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the
name of their respective entities to take, and will take, all such lawful and
necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

2.3   _Escrow._

  

(a)   _Indemnity Escrow_

  

(i)  At or prior to the Closing, Pubco, the Seller
Representative and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or such
other escrow agent mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Company), as
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), shall enter into an Escrow Agreement,
effective as of the Effective Time, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Pubco shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent a
number of Class B Exchange Shares (each valued at the Redemption Price) equal
to (x) fifteen percent (15%) of the estimated Exchange Consideration, divided
by (y) the Redemption Price otherwise issuable to the Sellers at the Closing
based on the Estimated Closing Statement (such Class B Exchange Shares,
together with any equity securities paid as dividends or distributions with
respect to such shares or into which such shares are exchanged or converted,
in each case, as long as they remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the "
_Indemnity Escrow Shares_ ") to be held, along with any other dividends,
distributions or other income on the Indemnity Escrow Shares, in each case,
as long as they remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account (together with the
Indemnity Escrow Shares, the " _Indemnity Escrow Property_ "), in a segregated
escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") and disbursed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
portion of the Class B Exchange Shares that shall be withheld at the Closing
for deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and any disbursement from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to Pubco, shall be allocated between the Class B
Sellers based on each such Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between
themselves). The Indemnity Escrow Shares shall serve as the sole and
exclusive source of payment of the obligations of the Sellers under _Section
2.5(d)_ and the obligations of the Indemnitors pursuant to _Article IX_
(other than with respect to (A) Fraud Claims or (B) any indemnification claims
for breach of any Company and Seller Fundamental Representations, for which
the Main Seller shall be solely responsible). Unless otherwise required by
Law, all distributions made from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be treated
by the Parties as an adjustment to the Exchange Consideration received by the
Sellers pursuant to _Article II_ hereof. Each Class B Seller shall be deemed
to be the owner of such Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between
themselves) of the Indemnity Escrow Shares during the time such
Indemnity Escrow Shares are held in the Indemnity Escrow Account, subject to
the retention of any dividends, distributions and other earnings thereon in
the Indemnity Escrow Account until disbursed therefrom in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each Class B
Seller shall have the right to vote such Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as
between themselves) of the Indemnity Escrow Shares (together with any equity
securities paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or
into which such shares are exchanged or converted) during the time held in the
Indemnity Escrow Account as Indemnity Escrow Shares.

  

(ii)  (A) Within three (3) Business Days after the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date (such anniversary, the " _First Escrow
Release Date_ "), the Purchaser Representative and Seller Representatives
shall give joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the
release of the First Released Escrow Property (if any) to the Class B Sellers;
(B) within three (3) Business Days after the twenty-four (24) month
anniversary (such anniversary, the " _Expiration Date_ "), the Purchaser
Representative and Seller Representatives shall give joint written instruction
to the Escrow Agent directing the release of all remaining Indemnity Escrow
Property (if any) to the Class B Sellers; and (C) the Indemnity Escrow
Property shall not be subject to any indemnification claim to the extent such
claim is made after the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , with
respect to any indemnification claim made in accordance with _Article IX_
hereof on or prior to the Expiration Date that remains unresolved at the time
and are still contested by an Indemnitee in good faith as of the Expiration
Date (any such claim, a " _Pending Claim_ "), an amount of the Indemnity
Escrow Property with a value (with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Shares,
calculated based on the Pubco Share Price as of the Expiration Date) equal to
the aggregate amount of the Pending Claims set forth in the Claim Notice
provided by the Purchaser Representative in accordance with _Section 9.4_ (as
adjusted in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)_ ) shall remain in the Indemnity
Escrow Account until such time as such Pending Claim shall have been finally
resolved and paid pursuant to the provisions of _Article IX_. After the
Expiration Date, to the extent that the value of the remaining Indemnity
Escrow Property (with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Shares, calculated based
on the Pubco Share Price) exceeds the aggregate amount of (a) resolved but
unpaid claims in favor of an Indemnitee and (b) the Pending Claims set forth
in the Claim Notice (as adjusted in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)_ )
submitted prior to the Expiration Date, an amount of Indemnity Escrow
Property having a value (with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Shares,
calculated based on the Pubco Share Price) equal to such excess shall be
promptly (and no later than three (3) Business Days) disbursed by the Escrow
Agent to the Class B Sellers (and Purchaser Representative and Seller
Representatives shall promptly give joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing such release), with respect to each release of the Indemnity
Escrow Property to the Class B Sellers, each such Seller shall receive such
Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between themselves) of such Indemnity
Escrow Property. Promptly after the final resolution of all Pending Claims
and payment of all indemnification obligations in connection therewith, the
Escrow Agent shall transfer any Indemnity Escrow Property remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account to the Class B Sellers with each such Seller
receiving such Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between themselves) of
such Indemnity Escrow Property.

(b)   _Earnout Escrow._

  

(i)  At the Closing, Pubco shall also cause to be delivered to
the Escrow Agent a number of Class B Exchange Shares (each valued at the
Redemption Price) equal to (x) thirty percent (30%) of the estimated Exchange
Consideration, divided by (y) the Redemption Price otherwise issuable to the
Sellers at the Closing based on the Estimated Closing Statement (such Exchange
Shares, together with any equity securities paid as dividends or
distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are
exchanged or converted, in each case, as long as they remain in the Earnout
Escrow Account, the " _Earnout Escrow Shares_ ", and together with the
Indemnity Escrow Shares, the _" Escrow Shares"_) to be held, along with any
other dividends, distributions or other income on the Earnout Escrow Shares,
in each case, as long as they remain in the Earnout Escrow Account (together
with the Earnout Escrow Shares, the " _Earnout Escrow Property_ _"_ ), in a
segregated escrow account (the " _Earnout Escrow Account_ ") separate from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, and disbursed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Class B Exchange
Shares that shall be withheld at the Closing for deposit in the Earnout
Escrow Account, and any disbursement from the Earnout Escrow Account to
Pubco, shall be allocated among the Class B Sellers based on each such
Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between themselves). For the avoidance
of doubt, the Earnout Escrow Shares may not serve as a source of payment for
the obligations of the Sellers under  _Section 2.5_ and the obligations of
the Indemnitors pursuant to _Article IX_ if the Indemnity Escrow Property is
insufficient to cover such obligations (provided, that the foregoing will not
prevent the Indemnitors from seeking remedies to satisfy the Main Seller's
obligations under _Sections 9.3(b)_ and _9.5_ for indemnification in excess of
the Indemnity Escrow Property after being released from the Earnout Escrow
Account). Unless otherwise required by Law, all distributions made from the
Earnout Escrow Account shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Exchange Consideration received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article II_
hereof. Until and unless the Earnout Escrow Shares are forfeited in accordance
with _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_  below, each Class B Seller shall be deemed to be
the owner of such Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between themselves) of
the Earnout Escrow Shares during the time such Earnout Escrow Shares are held
in the Earnout Escrow Account, subject to the retention of any dividends,
distributions and other earnings thereon in the Earnout Escrow Account until
disbursed therefrom in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each Class B Seller shall also have the
right to vote such Seller's relative Pro Rata Share (as between themselves)
of the Earnout Escrow Shares (together with any equity securities paid as
dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or into which such
shares are exchanged or converted) during the time held in the Earnout Escrow
Account as Earnout Escrow Shares.

  

(ii)  The Earnout Escrow Property shall be held in the Earnout
Escrow Account and will only become vested and not subject to forfeiture and
released to the Class B Sellers, to the extent that the applicable Earnout
Target is met for the applicable Earnout Year in accordance with _Section
2.6_ below. At the end of each Earnout Year, if the applicable Earnout Target
for such Earnout Year is not met, the Earnout Escrow Shares applicable to
such Earnout Year will be forfeited fully or partially, as applicable, by
the Class B Sellers and distributed to Pubco from the Earnout Escrow Account,
promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after a final
determination pursuant to _Sections 2.6(a)(i)_ or _2.6(a)(ii)_ that the
applicable Earnout Target was not met. In such case, the Purchaser
Representative and the Seller Representatives will provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release and surrender the applicable
portion of the Earnout Escrow Property to Pubco. Pubco will cancel any Earnout
Escrow Shares distributed to Pubco from the Earnout Escrow Account promptly
after its receipt thereof and cancel any accrued but unpaid dividends payable
in respect of such Earnout Escrow Shares. Each Class B Seller by execution of
this Agreement acknowledges that such Seller's right to receive the Earnout
Escrow Shares and the other Earnout Escrow Property is contingent on the
performance of Pubco and its Subsidiaries during the Earnout Period as set
forth in _Section 2.6_ and the Escrow Agreement, and that if the requirements
for the vesting and release of the Earnout Escrow Property to the Class B
Sellers as set forth in _Section 2.6_  and the Escrow Agreement are not met
in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement, the Earnout
Escrow Shares and the other applicable Earnout Escrow Property will not be
paid or delivered to the Class B Sellers, and the Class B Sellers shall have
no right to receive such Earnout Escrow Shares or such other applicable
Earnout Escrow Property.

2.4   _Estimated Closing Statement_. Not later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser a statement certified by the Company's chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
(a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Target Companies as of the
Reference Time, prepared in good faith and in accordance with the Accounting
Principles, (b) a good faith calculation of the Company's estimate of the
Closing Net Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses, in each case,
as of the Reference Time and along with reasonably detailed calculations, and
(c) the resulting estimated Exchange Consideration and Exchange Shares (valued
at the Redemption Price) to be issued and delivered by Pubco at the Closing
using the formula in _Section 2.2_ based on such estimates of Closing Net
Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses, which Estimated Closing
Statement shall be subject to the review (and not the approval) by Purchaser.
Promptly after delivering the Estimated Closing Statement to Purchaser, the
Company will meet with Purchaser to review and discuss the Estimated Closing
Statement and the Company will consider in good faith Purchaser's comments to
the Estimated Closing Statement and make applicable adjustments to the
Estimated Closing Statement prior to the Closing. Any such adjusted Estimated
Closing Statement shall thereafter be deemed the Estimated Closing Statement
for all purposes of this Agreement. The Estimated Closing Statement and the
determinations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement. The
Estimated Closing Statement will also include with respect to (i) any Closing
Net Debt, the amount owed to each creditor of any of the Target Companies and,
with respect to any Closing Net Debt that Purchaser and the Company agree to
satisfy at the Closing, payment instructions, together with payoff and lien
release letters from each Target Company's creditors in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, and (ii) Transaction Expenses, the amount
owed to each payee thereof and payment instructions therefor.

2.5   _Exchange Consideration Adjustment._

  

(a)  Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Pubco's
Chief Financial Officer (the " _CFO_ ") shall deliver to the Purchaser
Representative and the Seller Representatives a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Target
Companies as of the Reference Time and (ii) a good faith calculation of the
Closing Net Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses, in each case,
as of the Reference Time, and (iii) the resulting Exchange Consideration and
the number of Exchange Shares (each valued at the Redemption Price) that
should have been issued and delivered by Pubco at the Closing using the
formula in _Section 2.2_ based on such Closing Net Debt, Net Working Capital
and Transaction Expenses. The Closing Statement shall be prepared, and the
Closing Net Debt, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and the resulting
Exchange Consideration and Exchange Shares shall be determined in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with this
Agreement.

  

(b)  After delivery of the Closing Statement, each of the
Seller Representatives and the Purchaser Representative, and their respective
Representatives on their behalves, shall be permitted reasonable access to the
books, records, working papers, files, facilities and personnel of the Target
Companies relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement. The Seller
Representatives and the Purchaser Representative, and their respective
Representatives on their behalves, may make inquiries of the CFO and
related Pubco and Company personnel and advisors regarding questions
concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course
of their review thereof, and Pubco and the Company shall provide reasonable
cooperation in connection therewith. If either a Seller Representative or the
Purchaser Representative (each, a " _Representative Party_ ") has
any objections to the Closing Statement, such Representative Party shall
deliver to the CFO and the other Representative Parties a statement setting
forth its objections thereto (in reasonable detail and setting forth the
specific items to which such Representative Party is objecting) (an "
_Objection Statement_ "). If an Objection Statement is not delivered by a
Representative Party with respect to any item in the Closing Statement within
thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Closing
Statement, then such Representative Party will have waived its right to
contest such item in the Closing Statement, with such item deemed final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for purposes hereunder. If an Objection
Statement is delivered within such thirty (30) day period, then the Seller
Representatives and the Purchaser Representative shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any such objections for a period of twenty (20) days thereafter.
If the Seller Representatives and the Purchaser Representative do not reach a
final resolution within such twenty (20) day period, then upon the written
request of either Representative Party (the date of receipt of such notice by
the other Parties, the " _Independent Expert Notice Date_ "), the
Representative Parties will refer the dispute to the Independent Expert for
final resolution of the dispute in accordance with _Section 2.5(c)_. For
purposes hereof, the " _Independent Expert_ " shall mean a mutually acceptable
independent (i.e., no prior material business relationship with any party for
the prior two (2) years) accounting firm appointed by the Purchaser
Representative and the Seller Representative, which appointment will be made
no later than ten (10) days after the Independent Expert Notice
Date); provided, that if the Independent Expert does not accept its
appointment or if the Purchaser Representative and the Seller
Representative cannot agree on the Independent Expert, in either case within
twenty (20) days after the Independent Expert Notice Date, a
Representative Party may require, by written notice to the other
Representative Parties, that an alternative independent (i.e., no prior
material business relationship with any Party during the prior two (2) years)
accounting firm be selected by the New York City Regional Office of the AAA
in accordance with the AAA's procedures as the Independent Expert. The Parties
agree that the Independent Expert will be deemed to be independent even
though a Party or its Affiliates may, in the future, designate the Independent
Expert to resolve disputes of the types described in this _Section 2.5(b)_.
The Parties acknowledge that any information provided pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(b)_ will be subject to the confidentiality obligations of
_Section 8.13_.

(c)  If a dispute with respect to the Closing Statement is
submitted in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ to the Independent Expert for
final resolution, the Parties will follow the procedures set forth in this
_Section 2.5(c)_. Each of the Seller Representative and the Purchaser
Representative agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a
reasonable engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by
the Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will
be borne by Pubco. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other
costs and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with
resolving any dispute hereunder before the Independent Expert will be borne by
the Sellers, and all other costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser
Representative in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the
Independent Expert will be borne by Pubco. The Independent Expert will
determine only those issues still in dispute as of the Independent
Expert Notice Date and the Independent Expert's determination will be based
solely upon and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The determination by the Independent Expert will be based solely on
presentations with respect to such disputed items by the Purchaser
Representative and the Seller Representatives to the Independent Expert and
not on the Independent Expert's independent review; _provided_ , that such
presentations will be deemed to include any work papers, records, accounts or
similar materials delivered to the Independent Expert by a Representative
Party in connection with such presentations and any materials delivered to
the Independent Expert in response to requests by the Independent Expert. The
Independent Expert's determination with respect to any item must be within
the range of values assigned to such item in the Closing Statement and the
Objection Statement(s). The Seller Representatives and the Purchaser
Representative will use their reasonable efforts to make their respective
presentations as promptly as practicable following submission to the
Independent Expert of the disputed items, and each such Representative
Party will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the
presentation of the other Representative Party and any questions and requests
of the Independent Expert. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Seller
Representatives or the Purchaser Representative may, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, have any _ex parte_ communications with
the Independent Expert related to the matters set forth in this _Section
2.5._ In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will be bound by
the provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section 2.5_. The Parties
agree that the Independent Expert shall act as an expert, not as an
arbitrator, and that the activities of the Independent Expert in connection
herewith are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as) an
arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal
arbitration rules should be followed (including rules with respect to
procedures and discovery). The Seller Representatives and the Purchaser
Representative will request that the Independent Expert's determination be
made within forty-five (45) days after its engagement, or as soon thereafter
as possible, will be set forth in a written statement delivered to the
Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representatives and will be final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder (other than
for fraud or manifest error). The procedures set forth in this _Section 2.5_
shall be the sole and exclusive method at resolving any claims or
disputes with respect to the calculation of Closing Net Debt, Net Working
Capital and Transaction Expenses.

  

(d)  If it is finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.5_ that the number of Exchange Shares that should have been
delivered by Pubco at the Closing in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement (the " _Finally Determined Exchange Shares_ ") is:

  

(i)  greater than the number of Exchange Shares set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement (the " _Estimated Exchange Shares_ "), then
within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, Pubco shall
issue to the Sellers an additional number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares and
Pubco Class B Ordinary Shares equal to (x) the Finally Determined Exchange
Shares, minus (y) the Estimated Exchange Shares, with each Class A Seller
receiving its Pro Rata Share of such additional Pubco Ordinary Shares, solely
in the form of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares and each Class B Seller
receiving its Pro Rata Share of such additional Pubco Ordinary Shares, solely
in the form of Pubco Class B Ordinary Shares (in each case, rounded to the
nearest whole share), subject to a maximum amount equal to the amount of
Indemnity Escrow Property at such time (with each Escrow Share valued for
such purposes at the Redemption Price) divided by the Redemption Price; or

  

(ii)  less than the Estimated Exchange Shares, then within five
(5) Business Days after such final determination, the
Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representatives will provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to transfer and deliver to Pubco a
number of Indemnity Escrow Shares or other Indemnity Escrow Property with a
value (with each Indemnity Escrow Share valued at the Redemption Price) equal
to an amount equal to the product of (A) (x) Estimated Exchange Shares, minus
(y) the Finally Determined Exchange Shares, multiplied by (B) the Redemption
Price, up to a maximum amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Property at such
time.

  

Any Pubco Ordinary Shares issued under clause (i) hereof will be considered
additional Exchange Shares for purposes of this Agreement and, to the extent
applicable to a Seller, "Restricted Securities" under the applicable Lock-Up
Agreement. Pubco will cancel any Indemnity Escrow Shares that it receives
under clause (ii) hereof promptly after its receipt thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt and without duplication of the other provisions of this Agreement,
the number of Escrow Shares or other Pubco Ordinary Shares to be delivered
under this  _Section 2.5(d)_ shall be equitably adjusted for share splits,
reverse share splits, share dividends, combinations, subdivisions, exchanges,
recapitalizations, reclassifications and the like with respect to Pubco
Ordinary Shares after the Closing.

subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Class B Sellers'
rights to fifty percent (50%) of the Earnout Escrow Property (the " _First
Half Earnout Property_ ") shall vest and shall no longer be subject to
forfeiture. If the 2021 Net Income is less than the First Net Income Target,
but is equal to or greater than Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S.

forfeited.

  

(ii)  In the event that the Net Income for the calendar year

Twenty Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,925,000), then the Class B Sellers'
rights to fifty percent (50%) of the Second Half Earnout Property shall vest
and shall no longer be subject to forfeiture. In all other cases, the Second
Half Earnout Property will be forfeited.

  

(b)  If for any Earnout Year the Class B Sellers are entitled
to receive any Earnout Escrow Property for such Earnout Year, then such
Earnout Escrow Property will be due within three (3) Business Days after the
filing of Pubco's Form 20-F or Form 10-K with the SEC, and the Purchaser
Representative on behalf of Pubco shall provide written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to release to the Class B Sellers such Earnout Escrow Property
within three (3) Business Days thereafter. In the event the Class B
Sellers are not entitled to receive any or all of the Earnout Escrow Property

entitled to operate their respective businesses based upon the business
requirements of Pubco and its Subsidiaries. Each of Pubco and its
Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies will be permitted, following the
Closing (including during the Earnout Period), to make changes at its sole
discretion to its operations, organization, personnel, accounting practices
and other aspects of its business, including actions that may have an impact
on the 2021 Net Income and/or 2022 Net Income, the share price of
Pubco Ordinary Shares and the ability of the Class B Sellers to earn the
Earnout Escrow Property, and the Class B Sellers will not have any right to
claim the loss of all or any portion of any Earnout Escrow Property or other
damages as a result of such decisions. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Pubco
shall not, and shall cause it Subsidiaries not to, take any action, or omit to
take any action that is primarily in bad faith and designed for, or has the
primary purpose of, avoiding, reducing or preventing the achievement or
attainment of the First Net Income Target or the Second Net Income Target.

reasonably acceptable to Pubco (a " _Lost Certificate Affidavit_ "), which at
the reasonable discretion of Pubco may include a requirement that the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate deliver a bond in such sum

or destroyed.

no fraction of a Pubco Ordinary Share will be issued by Pubco by virtue of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Pubco Ordinary Share (after

Shares issued to such Person rounded down in the aggregate to the nearest
whole Pubco Ordinary Share.

available to the public generally with license, maintenance, support and other
fees of less than $20,000 per year, which are not required to be listed,
although such licenses that are material to the Target Companies' businesses
as currently conducted are "Company IP Licenses" as that term is used herein),
under which a Target Company is a licensee or otherwise is authorized to use
or practice any material Intellectual Property. Each Target Company owns,
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) all Company IP.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.13(a)(iii)_ , all material Company
Registered IP is owned exclusively by the applicable Target Company without
obligation to pay royalties, licensing fees or other fees, or otherwise

use all material Intellectual Property that is the subject of the Company IP
Licenses applicable to such Target Company. Other than Company IP, the Company
IP Licenses include all of the licenses, sublicenses and other agreements or
permissions for material Intellectual Property necessary to operate the
Target Companies as presently conducted. Each Target Company has performed all
material obligations imposed on it in the applicable Company IP Licenses, has
made all material payments required under the applicable Company IP Licenses
to date, and such Target Company is not in material breach or material
default thereunder. The continued use by the Target Companies of the material
Intellectual Property that is the subject of the Company IP Licenses in the
same or similar manner that it is currently being used is not prohibited by
such Company IP Licenses in material respects. To the Knowledge of the
Company, all registrations for material Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks
that are owned by any Target Company are valid and in force.

use by the Target Companies, except for any Action relating to
applications for Intellectual Property. During the past three (3) years, no
Target Company has received any written or to the Knowledge of the Company,
oral notice or claim that is currently pending, asserting that any
infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use of
the Intellectual Property of any other Person in material respects is or may
be occurring or has or may have occurred, in each case, as a consequence of
the business activities of any Target Company. There are no Orders to which
any Target Company is a party or is otherwise bound that (i) restrict the
rights of a Target Company to use, transfer, license or enforce any material
Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company, (ii) restrict the conduct of
the business of a Target Company in any material respects in order to
accommodate a third Person's Intellectual Property, or (iii) grant any third
Person any right with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Target Company is currently
infringing, or has, in the past three (3) years, infringed, misappropriated or
violated any Intellectual Property of any other Person in any material
respect as a result of the ownership, use or license of any material
Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company. To the Company's Knowledge,
no third party is infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise
violating any Intellectual Property owned by any Target Company and material
to the Target Companies' businesses as currently conducted (" _Company IP_ ")
in any material respect.

Company who develop material Intellectual Property for such Target Company
have assigned to such Target Company such material Intellectual Property
arising from the services performed for a Target Company by such Persons. To

independent contractors of a Target Company have claimed in writing any
ownership interest in any material Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company. The Company has made available to Purchaser true and complete copies
of templates of written Contracts used by the Target Companies under which
employees and independent contractors of a Target Company assigned the

employees and independent contractors to such Target Company. Each Target
Company has taken commercially reasonable security measures for the purposes
of protecting the secrecy and confidentiality of the material Trade Secrets
included in Company IP.

  

(e)  To the Knowledge of the Company, during the past three (3)
years, (i) no Person has obtained unauthorized access in any material
respects to third party personal information and data regarding individuals
that are protected by applicable data privacy Law, in the possession of a

the security, confidentiality or integrity of such information or data. Each
Target Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws
relating to privacy, personal data protection, and the collection, processing
and use of such personal information and its own privacy policies and
guidelines.

  

(f)  The consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in the material breach, material
modification, cancellation, termination, suspension of, or acceleration of any
payments by a Target Company under, or release of source code for software
included in Company IP because of: (i) any Contract providing for the
license granted by a Target Company to a third party to use material
Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company, or (ii) any Company IP
License. Following the Closing, the Company shall be permitted to exercise,
directly or indirectly through its Subsidiaries, all of the Target Companies'
material rights under such Contracts or Company IP Licenses to the same or
similar extent that the Target Companies would have been able to exercise had
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments which the Target Companies would otherwise be required
to pay in the absence of such transactions.

any Benefit Plan, whether or not subject to ERISA, which is not a Foreign

material Company Benefit Plans which are not in writing; (ii) the most recent
annual and periodic accounting of plan assets; (iii) the most recent actuarial
valuation; and (iv) all material communications in the past three (3) years
with any Governmental Authority concerning any matter that is still pending or

Authorities; (ii) no breach of fiduciary duty that would result in material
Liability to any Target Company has occurred; (iii) no Action that would
result in a material Liability to the Target Companies is pending, or to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened (other than routine claims for benefits
arising in the ordinary course of administration); and (iv) all contributions,
premiums and other payments (including any special contribution, interest or
penalty) required to be made with respect to a Company Benefit Plan have been

Plan.

  

(d)  To the extent applicable, the present value of the accrued
benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Company Benefit Plan,
determined as of the end of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year
on the basis of reasonable actuarial assumptions, did not materially exceed
the current value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan allocable to
such benefit liabilities.

  

(e)  The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents will not: (i) entitle any individual to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or other benefits or compensation
under any Company Benefit Plan or under any applicable Law; or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any
compensation due, or in respect of, any director, employee or independent
contractor of a Target Company.

Liabilities or obligations under any Environmental Laws.

under applicable Environmental Laws. To the Company's Knowledge, no fact,
circumstance, or condition exists in respect of any Target Company or any
property currently or formerly owned, operated, or leased by any Target
Company or any property to which a Target Company arranged for the disposal

6.22   _Insurance_.

  

(a)   _Schedule 6.22(a)_ lists all insurance policies (by
policy number, insurer, coverage period, coverage amount, annual premium and

otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such insurance policies.
To the Company's Knowledge, each such insurance policy (i) is legal, valid,
binding, enforceable and in full force and effect and (ii) will continue to
be legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect on
identical terms following the Closing. No Target Company has any self-

volumes. The relationships of each Target Company with the Top Customers and

Limited, provides contract-for-difference (" _CFD_ ") transaction services in
the Cayman Islands. Lion Brokers Limited does not provide CFD
transaction services in Hong Kong. Clients of Lion Brokers Limited are
required to review and execute their account opening documents online using a
cloud server, and Lion Brokers Limited has set up an appropriate filter
mechanism to prevent clients who are residents of Hong Kong from opening
accounts with Lion Brokers Limited. Clients of Lion Brokers Limited are
required to send their transaction requests through the Company's server, and
Lion Brokers Limited will either act as a principal and trade with the
clients, or act as a broker by passing on the transaction orders netted with
other clients to third-party market makers. For the purpose of CFD
transactions, Lion Brokers Limited opened two types of accounts in its own
name in Hong Kong with the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (" _BOCHK_ "),a
house account and a client account, after going through the know-your
customer and the anti-money laundering procedures with the BOCHK. Clients are
required to deposit funds into the client account. Upon execution and
settlement of CFD transactions, the commission and any profit and loss arising
from the CFD transactions are debited from or credited to the client account
or the house account, as applicable. Such CFD transaction services are deemed
to be in compliance with applicable local Laws and regulations in all
material respects, and the fund settlement between the client account and
the house account in Hong Kong is not deemed to be conducting a CFD business
in Hong Kong and is not otherwise in violation of Hong Kong laws and
regulations.

to the extent required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each Party hereto agrees to make
any required filing or application under Antitrust Laws, as applicable, at
such Party's sole cost and expense, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be reasonably requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to
take all other actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under Antitrust
Laws as soon as practicable, including by requesting early termination of the
waiting period provided for under the Antitrust Laws. Each Party shall, in
connection with its efforts to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Antitrust Law, use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other Party or its Affiliates in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person; (ii) keep
the other Parties reasonably informed of any communication received by such
Party or its Representatives from, or given by such Party or its
Representatives to, any Governmental Authority and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(iii) permit a Representative of the other Parties and their respective
outside counsel to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or
other Person, give a Representative or Representatives of the other Parties
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences;
(iv) in the event a Party's Representative is prohibited from participating in
or attending any meetings or conferences, the other Parties shall keep such
Party promptly and reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (v) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the filing of any memoranda,
white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending the transactions contemplated hereby,
articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority.

  

(c)  As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and
use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with Governmental
Authorities requests for approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have such
Governmental Authorities approve the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Parties if
such Party or any of its Representatives (or with respect to the Company, any
Seller) receives any notice from such Governmental Authorities in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly
furnish the other Parties with a copy of such Governmental Authority
notice. If any Governmental Authority requires that a hearing or meeting be
held in connection with its approval of the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether prior to the Closing or after the Closing, each Party shall arrange
for Representatives of such Party to be present for such hearing or meeting.
If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by any applicable Governmental Authority or any
private Person challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document as violative of any applicable Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections
or Actions so as to timely permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including
in order to resolve such objections or Actions which, in any case if not
resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. In the event any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private Person challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any Ancillary Document, the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,
that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  

(d)  Prior to the Closing, each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consents of Governmental
Authorities or other third Persons as may be necessary for the consummation by
such Party or its Affiliates of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or required as a result of the execution or performance of, or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement by such
Party or its Affiliates, and the other Parties shall provide
reasonable cooperation in connection with such efforts. With respect to
Pubco, during the Interim Period, the Company, Pubco and Merger Sub shall
take all reasonable actions necessary to cause Pubco to qualify as "foreign
private issuer" as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 3b-4 and to
maintain such status through the Closing.

8.11   _The Registration Statement_.

  

(a)  As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
Purchaser and Pubco shall jointly prepare, and Pubco shall (at the sole cost

with the registration under the Securities Act of the Pubco Securities to be
issued under this Agreement to the holders of Purchaser Securities prior to
the Effective Time, which Registration Statement will also contain a proxy
statement of Purchaser (as amended, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for the
purpose of soliciting proxies or votes from Purchaser shareholders for the
matters to be acted upon at the Special Stockholder Meeting and providing the
Public Stockholders an opportunity in accordance with Purchaser's
Organizational Documents and the IPO Prospectus to have their Purchaser
Common Stock redeemed (the " _Redemption_ ") in conjunction with the

shall include proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from
Purchaser shareholders to vote, at an extraordinary general meeting of
Purchaser stockholders to be called and held for such purpose (the " _Special
Stockholder Meeting_ "), in favor of resolutions approving (A) the adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the Transactions (including, to the extent
required, the issuance of the Exchange Shares and the PIPE Shares), by the
holders of Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with Purchaser's
Organizational Documents, the NRS and the rules and regulations of the SEC
and Nasdaq, (B) to the extent required by the Federal Securities Laws, Nevada
Law or the BVI Act, the adoption of the Amended Pubco Charter, (C) the

aggregate number of Pubco Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding immediately
after the Closing, (D) the appointment of the members of the Post-Closing
Pubco Board, in each case in accordance with _Section 8.14_ hereof, (E)
such other matters as the Company, Pubco and Purchaser shall hereafter

Transactions (the approvals described in foregoing clauses (A) through (E),
collectively, the " _Stockholder Approval Matters_ ", and (F) the adjournment
of the Special Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the
reasonable determination of Purchaser.

  

(b)  Purchaser, acting through its board of directors (or a
committee thereof), shall (i) make the Purchaser Recommendation and include
such Purchaser Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies or
votes in favor of the approval of the Stockholder Approval Matters, and
(iii) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the approval of
the Stockholder Approval Matters. If on the date for which the Special
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Purchaser has not received proxies and votes
representing a sufficient number of shares to obtain the Stockholder Approval
Matters, whether or not a quorum is present, Purchaser may make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Special Stockholder Meeting.
In connection with the Registration Statement, Purchaser and Pubco will file
with the SEC financial and other information about the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law, Purchaser's
Organizational Documents, the NRS and the rules and regulations of the SEC and
Nasdaq. Purchaser and Pubco shall cooperate and provide the Company (and its
counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to
filing the same with the SEC. The Company shall provide Purchaser with such
information concerning the Target Companies and their equity holders,
officers, directors, employees, assets, Liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise), business and operations that may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements
thereto, which information provided by the Company shall be true and correct
and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading.

terms and conditions of this Agreement and Purchaser's Organizational
Documents.

8.14   _Post-Closing Board of Directors and Executive Officers_.

  

(a)  The Parties shall take all necessary action, including
causing the directors of the Pubco to resign, so that effective as of the
Closing, Pubco's board of directors (the " _Post-Closing Pubco Board_ ") will
consist of seven (7) individuals. Immediately after the Closing, the Parties
shall take all necessary action to designate and appoint to the Post-Closing
Pubco Board (i) the two (2) persons that are designated by Purchaser prior to
the Closing (the " _Purchaser Directors_ "), at least one (1) of whom shall
be required to qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules, (ii)
the four (4) persons that are designated by the Company prior to the Closing
(the " _Company Directors_ "), at least two (2) of whom shall be required to
qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules; and (iii) the one (1)
person that is mutually agreed upon and designated by Purchaser and the
Company prior to the Closing (the " _Independent Director_ ") who shall be
required to qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules. Pursuant
to the Amended Pubco Charter as in effect as of the Closing, the Post-Closing
Pubco Board will be a classified board with two classes of directors, with
(I) one class of directors, consisting of two Company Directors designated by
the Company and the Independent Director (collectively, the " _Class I
Directors_ "), initially serving a one (1) year term, such term effective
from the Closing (and any subsequent Class I Directors serving a two (2) year
term), and (II) a second class of directors, consisting of two Company
Directors designated by the Company and the Purchaser Directors (collectively,
the " _Class II Directors_ "), initially serving a two (2) year term, such
term effective from the Closing (and any subsequent Class II Directors
serving a two (2) year term). In accordance with the Pubco Charter as in
effect at the Closing, no director on the Post-Closing Pubco Board may be
removed without cause. At or prior to the Closing, Pubco will provide each
Purchaser Director, Company Director and the Independent Director with a
customary director indemnification agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such Purchaser Director, Company Director or
Independent Director.

  

(b)  The Parties shall take all action necessary, including
causing the executive officers of Pubco to resign, so that the individuals
serving as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
respectively, of Pubco immediately after the Closing will be the same
individuals (in the same office) as that of the Company immediately prior to

another qualified person to either such role, in which case, such
other person identified by the Company shall serve in such role).

8.15   _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Tail Insurance_.

  

(a)  The Parties agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the
current or former directors and officers of each Target Company, Pubco,
Merger Sub and Purchaser and each Person who served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the
request of the applicable Party (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") as
provided in Purchaser's Organizational Documents or under any
indemnification, employment or other similar agreements between any DandO
Indemnified Person and Purchaser, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Pubco
shall cause the Organizational Documents of each Target Company, Pubco,
Merger Sub and Purchaser to contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to DandO
Indemnified Persons than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Organizational Documents of the applicable Party to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The provisions of this _Section 8.15_ shall survive the
Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and
representatives.

  

(b)  For the benefit of Purchaser's directors and officers,
Purchaser shall be permitted prior to the Effective Time to obtain and fully
pay the premium for a "tail" insurance policy (at an aggregate cost that is
borne by Purchaser of no higher than 200% of the annual premium of
Purchaser's directors' and officers' liabilities insurance policy as of the
date of this Agreement) that provides coverage for up to a six-year period
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Tail Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and
in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than Purchaser's existing
policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage. If obtained, Pubco and Purchaser shall, for a period
of six (6) years after the Effective Time, maintain the DandO Tail Insurance in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, and
Pubco and Purchaser shall timely pay or cause to be paid all premiums with
respect to the DandO Tail Insurance.

  

8.16   _Trust Account Proceeds_. The Parties agree that after the
Closing, the funds in the Trust Account, after taking into account payments
for the Redemption, and any proceeds received by Pubco or Purchaser from
any PIPE Investment shall first be used to pay (i) Purchaser's accrued
Expenses, including Purchaser's deferred Expenses of the IPO and (ii) any
loans owed by Purchaser to Sponsor for Expenses (including deferred Expenses),
other administrative costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser
or Extension Expenses. Such amounts, as well as any Expenses that are
required or permitted to be paid by delivery of Pubco Securities, will be
paid at the Closing. Any remaining cash will be transferred to a Target
Company or Pubco and used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

  

8.17   _PIPE Investment_. Without limiting anything to the contrary
contained herein, during the Interim Period, Purchaser may, but shall not be
required to (and if requested by Purchaser, Pubco will), enter into and
consummate subscription agreements with investors relating to a private
equity investment in Purchaser or Pubco to purchase shares of Purchaser or
Pubco (" _PIPE Shares_ ") in connection with a private placement, and/or
enter into backstop or redemption waiver arrangements with potential
investors, in either case on terms mutually agreeable to the Company,
Purchaser and Pubco, acting reasonably (a " _PIPE Investment_ "), and, if
Purchaser elects to seek a PIPE Investment, Pubco, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, cooperate with each other and their
respective Representatives in connection with such PIPE Investment and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such PIPE
Investment to occur (including having the Company's senior management
participate in any investor meetings and roadshows as reasonably requested by
Purchaser).

9.3   _Limitations and General Indemnification Provisions_.

  

(a)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Article
IX_ , the Indemnitees will not be entitled to receive any
indemnification payments under clause (a) of _Section 9.2_ unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Indemnitees for which they are
otherwise entitled to indemnification under this _Article IX_ exceeds the
value of one-half percent (0.5%) of the Exchange Consideration (the "
_Basket_ "), in which case the Indemnitors shall be obligated to
the Indemnitees for the amount of all Losses of the Indemnitees from the
first dollar of Losses of the Indemnitees required to reach the Basket,
subject to the other limitations herein; provided, however, that the Basket
shall not apply to (i) indemnification claims for breaches of any Company and
Sellers Fundamental Representations or (ii) Fraud Claims.

  

(b)  The maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments
which the Indemnitors will be obligated to pay under _Section 9.2_ (other
than (i) Fraud Claims or (ii) any indemnification claims for breaches of any
Company and Sellers Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Exchange Consideration, provided, that
any (A) Fraud Claims or (B) indemnification claims for breaches of any
Company and Sellers Fundamental Representations, shall be payable solely by
the Main Seller, and the maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments
for such claims and all other claims in connection with this Agreement shall
not exceed an amount equal to the Exchange Consideration received by the Main
Seller.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no Indemnitor will have any indemnification obligations under  _Section 9.2_
for any Loss to the extent that such Loss is included in the calculation of
Net Working Capital, Closing Net Debt or Transaction Expenses in determining
the Finally Determined Exchange Shares in accordance with _Section 2.5_. In
no event will any Indemnitee be entitled to any recovery for any Loss more
than once or to the extent that such Loss was expressly reserved for in the
Company Financials.

  

(d)  Solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses
under this _Article IX_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach giving rise to the indemnification
claim), all of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Agreement (including the disclosure schedules hereto) or any Ancillary
Document that are qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or words
of similar import or effect will be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification.

  

(e)  No investigation or knowledge by an Indemnitee,
Purchaser or their respective Representatives of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of an Indemnitor shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company, any
Seller or any Seller Representative or the recourse available to the
Indemnitees or Purchaser under any provision of this Agreement, including
this _Article IX_ , with respect thereto.

  

(f)  The amount of any Losses suffered or incurred by any
Indemnitee shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any insurance proceeds paid

of the costs of collection and the increases in insurance premiums resulting
from such Loss or insurance payment and (ii) the amount of any Tax benefit
actually realized as a result of such Loss by any Indemnitee or any Affiliate
thereof in the taxable year in which such Loss was incurred or the
following taxable year. No right of subrogation shall accrue to any insurer

9.4   _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a)  The Purchaser Representative shall have the sole right
to act on behalf of the Indemnitees with respect to any
indemnification claims made pursuant to this _Article IX,_ including bringing
and settling any indemnification claims hereunder and receiving any notices
on behalf of the Indemnitees. The Seller Representatives, acting together
shall have the sole right to act on behalf of the Indemnitors with respect to
any indemnification claims made pursuant to this _Article IX,_ including
defending and settling any indemnification claims hereunder and receiving any
notices on behalf of the Indemnitors.

  

(b)  In order to make a claim for indemnification hereunder,
the Purchaser Representative must, on behalf of an Indemnitee provide written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of such claim to the Seller Representatives on
behalf of the Indemnitors and to the Escrow Agent, which Claim Notice shall
include (i) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances which
relate to the subject matter of such indemnification claim to the extent then
known and (ii) the amount of Losses suffered by the Indemnitee in connection
with the claim to the extent known or reasonably estimable (provided, that the
Purchaser Representative may thereafter, but prior to the Expiration Date, in
good faith adjust the amount of Losses with respect to the claim by providing
a revised Claim Notice to the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent);
provided, that the copy of any Claim Notice provided to the Escrow
Agent shall be redacted for any confidential or proprietary information of
the Indemnitor or the Indemnitee described in clause (i).

  

(c)  In the case of any claim for indemnification under this
Article IX arising from a claim of a third party (including any Governmental
Authority) (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Purchaser Representative must, in
addition to complying with _Section 9.4(b)_ , give a Claim Notice with
respect to such Third Party Claim to the Seller Representatives promptly
(but in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the Indemnitee's initial
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, that the failure to
timely give such notice will not relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification
obligations except to the extent that the defense of such Third Party Claim
is actually prejudiced by the failure to timely give such notice. The Seller
Representatives will have the right to defend and to direct the defense
against any such Third Party Claim in their names and at their expense, and
with counsel selected by the Seller Representatives, unless at any time while
such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) there is a conflict of interest
between the Seller Representatives on behalf of the Indemnitor and the
Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee in the conduct of such
defense, (B) the applicable third party alleges a fraud claim, (C) such claim
is criminal in nature, could reasonably be expected to lead to criminal
proceedings, or seeks an injunction or other equitable relief as a primary
remedy against the Indemnitee or (D) the amount of the Third Party Claim
(other than any Fraud Claims or claims based on breach of any Company and
Seller Fundamental Representations (together with any amounts for pending but
unresolved indemnification claims and resolved but unpaid indemnification
claims) exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the value of the remaining
Indemnity Escrow Property in the Indemnity Escrow Account. If the Seller
Representatives on behalf of the Indemnitor elects, and is entitled, to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, they will within twenty (20) days
after receipt of the Claim Notice ( or sooner, if the nature of the Third
Party Claim so requires) notify the Purchaser Representative of its intent to
do so, and the Purchaser Representative and the Indemnitee will, at the
request and expense of the Seller Representatives, cooperate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim, including to furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. If
the Seller Representatives on behalf of the Indemnitor elects not to, or at
any time is not entitled under this _Section 9.4_ to, compromise or defend
such Third Party Claim or fails to notify the Purchaser Representative of its
election as herein provided, the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the
Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, subject to
_Section 9.4(d)._

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Indemnitor will have no indemnification obligations with respect
to any such Third Party Claim which is settled by the Indemnitee or the
Purchaser Representative without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representatives on behalf of the Indemnitor (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee will not be required to refrain
from paying any Third Party Claim which has matured by a final, non-
appealable Order, nor will it be required to refrain from paying any
Third Party Claim where the delay in paying such claim will result in the
immediate foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the property or assets then held
by the Indemnitee or where any delay in payment will cause the Indemnitee
material economic Loss. Additionally, if the Seller Representative is not
controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Purchaser Representative
on behalf of the Indemnitee may not compromise or settle such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Seller Representative
if such compromise or settlement requires the taking or restriction of any
action (including the payment of money and competition restrictions) by the
Indemnitee other than the execution of a release for such Third Party Claim.
The Seller Representatives' right on behalf of the Indemnitor to direct the
defense will include the right to compromise or enter into an agreement
settling any Third Party Claim; provided, that no such compromise or
settlement will, without the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the
Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee, obligate the Indemnitee
to agree to any settlement that requires the taking or restriction of any
action (including the payment of money and competition restrictions) by the
Indemnitee other than the execution of a release for such Third Party Claim;
provided that the Seller Representatives on behalf of the Indemnitors may
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the Indemnitee's prior
written consent, so long as such compromise or settlement (i) only
involves the payment of monetary damages that are borne in full by the
Indemnitors, taking into account the remainder of the Indemnity
Escrow Property, the amount of any Pending Claims that are resolved but
unpaid, and the other limitations therein and does not include any
requirement that the Indemnitee take or refrain from taking any actions other
than compliance with any customary confidentiality or non-disparagement
obligations in connection therewith; and (ii) does not involve any statement,
finding or admission of any wrongdoing of, or violation of Law by, the
Indemnitee (such settlement described in clauses (i) and (ii), "
_Permitted Settlement_ "). Other than any Permitted Settlement,
notwithstanding the Seller Representatives' right on behalf of the Indemnitor
to compromise or settle in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
the Seller Representatives on behalf of the Indemnitor may not settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim over the objection of the Purchaser
Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee; provided, however, that consent
by the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee to settlement or
compromise will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee will have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it, subject to the Seller Representatives' right on behalf of the Indemnitor
to direct the defense. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnitor shall not be
responsible for any attorneys' fees or other costs or expenses incurred by
the Indemnitee in connection with its participation in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, during the period in which the Seller Representatives on
behalf of the Indemnitors are entitled to control the defense pursuant to
this _Section 9.4._

  

  

(e)  With respect to any direct indemnification claim that
is not a Third Party Claim, the Seller Representatives on behalf of the
Indemnitor will after receipt of the Claim Notice respond thereto in a
reasonable time. If the Seller Representatives responds and rejects such
claim in whole or in part, the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the
Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available under
this Agreement (subject to _Section 13.4_ , any Ancillary Documents or
applicable Law.

9.5   _Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification claims
against the Indemnitors shall first be applied against the Indemnity Escrow
Shares (pro rata among the Class B Exchange Shares) then against any other
Indemnity Escrow Property before any Indemnitor shall be required to make any
out-of-pocket payment for indemnification. Any indemnification obligation of
an Indemnitor under this _Article IX_ will be paid within five (5) Business
Days after the final non-appealable determination of such obligation in
accordance with _Section 9.4_ (and the Purchaser Representative and the Seller
Representatives will provide or cause to be provided to the Escrow Agent any
written instructions or other information or documents required by the Escrow
Agent to do so). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any indemnification payments will be made to Pubco or its successors. With
respect to any indemnification payment, the value of each Indemnity Escrow
Share or any other Pubco Ordinary Shares for purposes of determining the
indemnification payment shall be the Pubco Share Price on the date that the
indemnification claim is finally determined in accordance with this _Article
IX_. To the extent that Pubco Class B Ordinary Shares are used for the
payment of indemnification obligations, such shares shall be valued based on
the number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares into which such shares may then
be converted. Any Indemnity Escrow Shares or any other Pubco Ordinary Shares
received by Pubco as an indemnification payment shall be promptly cancelled
by Pubco after its receipt thereof.

  

9.6   _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except with
respect to (i) claims relating to Exchange Consideration, which shall be
exclusively governed by _Article II_ , (ii) claims seeking injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief (including pursuant to
_Section 13.6_ ), or (iii) claims under the Ancillary Documents,
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for the Parties with respect to matters arising under this
Agreement of any kind or nature (whether or not arising from a Third Party
Claim) with respect to any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, or
breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to such
subject matter of this Agreement, including the negotiation and discussion
thereof, and the Indemnitees shall not otherwise be entitled, whether under
law or in equity, to seek contribution, cost recovery, Losses or any other
recourse or remedy from any Seller personally (excluding pursuant to the
Indemnity Escrow Account) other than the Main Seller as provided herein.

the Outside Date (i) if pursuant to an Automatic Extension, for an additional
period of three (3) months or (ii) if pursuant to a Charter Extension, for an
additional period equal to the shorter of (A) three additional months and (B)
the period ending on the last date for Purchaser to consummate its initial
Business Combination pursuant to such Charter Extension (but in no more than
two Extensions (whether Automatic Extensions or Charter Extensions) by
Purchaser in total under this proviso); and _provided, further_ , that if
Purchaser has obtained an Extension beyond the initial Outside Date, and the
Closing has not occurred by the initial Outside Date solely because of
the failure to obtain the Consents listed on _Schedule 10.1(c)_ and where the
Company, the Sellers, Pubco and Merger Sub have otherwise complied in all
material respects with their obligations under this Agreement, including
_Section 8.9_ , with respect to obtaining such Consents, then the Company
shall have the right by providing written notice thereof to Purchaser to
extend the Outside Date for the shorter of (i) one additional month and (ii)
the period ending on the last date for Purchaser to consummate its initial
Business Combination pursuant to such Extension; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall not
be available to a Party if the breach or violation by such Party or its
Affiliates (or with respect to the Company, the Sellers, Pubco or Merger Sub)
of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement
was the proximate cause of, or proximately resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date.

  

(c)  by written notice by either Purchaser or the Company if a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order
or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order
or other action has become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)_ shall
not be available to a Party if the failure by such Party or its Affiliates
(or with respect to the Company, the Sellers, Pubco or Merger Sub) to comply
with any provision of this Agreement has been a substantial cause of, or
substantially resulted in, such action by such Governmental Authority;

  

(d)  by written notice by the Company to Purchaser, if (i)
there has been a breach by Purchaser of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Purchaser shall have become untrue or
materially inaccurate, in any case, which would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.2(b)_ to be satisfied
(treating the Closing Date for such purposes as the date of this Agreement
or, if later, the date of such breach (or if the breach is curable, the date
by which such breach is required to be cured in the succeeding clause (ii)),
and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is not cured
within the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days after written notice of such
breach or inaccuracy is provided to Purchaser by the Company or (B) the
Outside Date; provided, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(d)_ if at such time the
Company, Pubco, Merger Sub or any Seller is in material uncured breach of this
Agreement which would result in a failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 10.3(a)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_ from being satisfied;

  

(e)  by written notice by Purchaser to the Company, if (i)
there has been a breach by the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub or any Seller of
any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of such
Parties shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in any case, which
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ or
_Section 10.3(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for such
purposes as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such
breach(or if the breach is curable, the date by which such breach is required
to be cured in the succeeding clause (ii)), and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy
is incapable of being cured or is not cured within the earlier of (A) twenty
(20) days after written notice of such breach or inaccuracy is provided to
the Company by Purchaser or (B) the Outside Date; provided, that Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 11.1(e)_ if at such time Purchaser is in material uncured breach of
this Agreement ; which would result in a failure of any condition set forth
in Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) from being satisfied;

  

(f)  by written notice by Purchaser to the Company, if there
shall have been a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Pubco following
the date of this Agreement which is uncured and continuing; or

  

(g)  by written notice by either Purchaser or the Company to
the other if the Special Stockholder Meeting is held (including any

11.2   _Effect of Termination_. This Agreement may only be
terminated in the circumstances described in _Section 11.1_ and pursuant to a
written notice delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable
Parties, which sets forth the basis for such termination, including the
provision of _Section 11.1_ under which such termination is made. In the
event of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_ ,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability
on the part of any Party or any of their respective Representatives, and all
rights and obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i) _Sections
8.12_, _8.13_ , _11.3_ , _11.4_ , _12.1_ , _Article XIII_ and this _Section
11.2_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein
shall relieve any Party from Liability for any willful breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement or
any Fraud Claim against such Party, in either case, prior to termination of
this Agreement (in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to
_Section 12.1_ ). Without limiting the foregoing, and except as provided in
_Sections 11.3_ and this _Section 11.2_ (but subject to _Section 12.1_ , and
subject to the right to seek injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief in accordance with _Section 13.6_ ), the Parties' sole right
prior to the Closing with respect to any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement by another
Party or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be the right, if applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 11.1_.

  

11.3   _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Sections 11.4_ and _12.1_ ,
unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such expenses. As used in this Agreement, "
_Expenses_ " shall include all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors,
financing sources, experts and consultants to a Party hereto or any of its
Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document related hereto and
all other matters related to the consummation of this Agreement. With respect
to Purchaser, Expenses shall include any and all deferred expenses (including
fees or commissions payable to the underwriters and any legal fees) of the IPO
upon consummation of a Business Combination and any Extension Expenses.

11.4   _Termination Fee_. Notwithstanding _Section 11.3_ above, in
the event that there is a valid and effective termination of this Agreement
by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_ , (other than as a result of any
breach of _Section 8.8_ ,  _Section 8.9_ or _Section 8.10_ (in each case of
_Section 8.9_ and _Section 8.10_ , solely as it relates to any Consent set
forth on _Schedule 10.1(c)_ ); then the Company shall pay to Purchaser a
termination fee equal to Two Million Three Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars
($2,300,000), plus the Expenses actually incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates in connection with the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents or the Transactions, including any related SEC filings,
the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, the Redemption and any PIPE
Investment (such aggregate amount, the " _Termination Fee_ "). The Termination
Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Purchaser following such termination of this
Agreement and within five (5) Business Days after Purchaser delivers to the
Company the amount of such Expenses, along with reasonable documentation in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to
any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee
is payable, the payment of the Termination Fee shall, in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which
Purchaser would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company, Pubco,
Merger Sub, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or shareholders with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Purchaser, provided, that the foregoing shall not limit the rights of
Purchaser to seek specific performance or other injunctive relief to
consummate the Transactions in lieu of (and not in addition to) of
terminating this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this
Agreement is terminated as a result of a breach of the covenants in _Section
8.8_ , Section _8.9_ or _Section 8.10_ (solely as such Sections _8.9_ and
_8.10_  relate to any Consent set forth on _Schedule 10.1(c)_ ) and a
Termination Fee is not payable hereunder, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit or otherwise prejudice Purchaser's right to pursue any other remedies
which Purchaser may have at law or in equity including, but not limited to,
the right to seek monetary damages.

  

Article XII _ 
 WAIVERS AND Releases_

  

12.1   _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the
IPO Prospectus. The Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives
and each Seller hereby represents and warrants that it has read the IPO
Prospectus and understands that Purchaser has established the Trust Account
containing the proceeds of the IPO and the overallotment shares acquired by
Purchaser's underwriters and from certain private placements occurring
simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time
thereon) for the benefit of Purchaser's public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser's underwriters) (the " _Public
Stockholders_ ") and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO
Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to
the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (or Pubco Ordinary Shares upon the Merger) in
connection with the consummation of its initial business combination (as such
term is used in the IPO Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ ") or in
connection with an amendment to Purchaser's Organizational documents to extend
Purchaser's deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the Public
Stockholders if the Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination
within 12 months after the closing of the IPO (provided such date may be
extended by an additional six (6) months), subject to further extension by
amendment to Purchaser's Organizational Documents, (c) with respect to any
interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, amounts necessary
to pay for any franchise or income taxes, and (d) to Purchaser after or
concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination, in each case,
subject to the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of Purchaser
entering into this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the
Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives and each Seller hereby
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the
Seller Representatives or any Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates
do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom made directly or indirectly to Public Stockholders (" _Public
Stockholder Distributions_ "), or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any Public Stockholder Distributions), regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way
to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between
Purchaser or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Company,
Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives or any Seller or any of their
respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and
regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any
other theory of legal liability (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ ").
Each of the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives and each
Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any
Released Claims that any such Party or any of its Affiliates may have against
the Trust Account (including any Public Stockholder Distributions) now or in
the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with Purchaser or its Representatives and will not seek recourse
against the Trust Account (including any Public Stockholder Distributions) for
any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or
any other agreement with Purchaser or its Affiliates). The Company,
Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives and each Seller each agrees and
acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and
specifically relied upon by Purchaser and its Affiliates to induce Purchaser
to enter in this Agreement, and each of the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the
Seller Representatives and each Seller further intends and understands such
waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against such Party and each of
its Affiliates under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary in this Section 12.1, but otherwise subject to the terms of this
Agreement, (A) the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives or
any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates may commence any action or
proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any
matter relating to Purchaser or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks,
in whole or in part, monetary relief against Purchaser or its Representatives,
against assets or funds held outside of the Trust Account (including any
funds released from the Trust Account and assets that are acquired with such
funds other than the Public Stockholder Distributions); _provided_ that such
claim shall not permit such Party or any of its Affiliates (or any Person
claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim
against the Trust Account or any amounts contained therein or Public
Stockholder Distributions, and (B) nothing in this Section 12.1 shall limit or
prohibit the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Seller Representatives, any
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates from pursuing a claim against
Purchaser for specific performance or other equitable relief. This _Section
12.1_ shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.

12.2   _Release and Covenant Not to Sue_.

  

(a)  Effective as of the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each Seller, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates that owns any share or other equity interest in or of such
Seller (the " _Seller Releasing Persons_ "), hereby releases and discharges
the Target Companies from and against any and all Actions, obligations,
agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both
at law and in equity, which such Seller Releasing Person now has, has ever had
or may hereafter have against the Target Companies arising on or prior to the
Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the releases and restrictions set forth in this Section 12.2 (a)shall not
apply to any claims a Seller Releasing Person may have against any party with
respect to (i) any rights under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents, (ii) any rights to indemnification, fee reimbursement or
exculpation under (x) any Organizational Documents of the Target Companies,
(y) any (A) Material Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement
which is disclosed to Purchaser and any (B) Contract that is not a Material
Contract but is in effect as of the date of this Agreement and, in either the
case of clauses (A) or (B), not required by this Agreement to be terminated as
of the Closing, or (z) any Contract that is entered into after the date
hereof in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) any rights under
applicable employment Laws (including common law). From and after the
Closing, each Seller Releasing Person hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain
from, directly or indirectly, asserting any Action, or commencing or causing
to be commenced, any Action of any kind against the Target Companies or their
respective Affiliates, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

  

(b)  Effective as of the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Sponsor, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (the " _Sponsor Releasing Persons_ "), hereby releases and
discharges the Purchaser from and against any and all Actions, obligations,
agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both
at law and in equity, which such Sponsor Releasing Person now has, has ever
had or may hereafter have against the Purchaser arising on or prior to
the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the releases and restrictions set forth herein shall not apply to
any claims a Sponsor Releasing Person may have against any party with respect
to any rights under this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or any
Contract set forth in _Schedule 12.2(b)_ or (ii) any rights to
indemnification, fee reimbursement or exculpation. From and after the
Closing, each Sponsor Releasing Person hereby irrevocably covenants to
refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any Action, or commencing or
causing to be commenced, any Action of any kind against the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

also require the prior written consent of the Purchaser Representative and the
Seller Representatives.

13.16   _Legal Representation_.

  

(a)  The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the fact that EGS
may have, prior to Closing, jointly represented Purchaser and the Sponsor in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Transactions,
and has also represented Purchaser, Sponsor and/or their respective
Affiliates in connection with matters other than the transaction that is the
subject of this Agreement, EGS will be permitted in the future, after Closing,
to represent the Sponsor or its Affiliates in connection with matters in
which such Persons are adverse to Pubco, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, including any disputes arising out of, or related to, this
Agreement. The Company, Pubco, Merger Sub and the Sellers, who are or have
the right to be represented by independent counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, hereby agree, in advance, to
waive (and to cause their Affiliates to waive) any actual or potential
conflict of interest that may hereafter arise in connection with EGS's future
representation of one or more of the Sponsor or its Affiliates in which the
interests of such Person are adverse to the interests of Pubco, Merger Sub,
Purchaser, the Company and/or the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates, including any matters that arise out of this Agreement
or that are substantially related to this Agreement or to any prior
representation by EGS of the Sponsor, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, for the purposes of the
attorney-client privilege, the Sponsor shall be deemed the client of EGS with
respect to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents. All such communications shall remain privileged
after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client confidence
relating thereto shall belong solely to the Sponsor, shall be controlled by
the Sponsor and shall not pass to or be claimed by Pubco or Purchaser;
provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a
waiver by Pubco, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates of any
applicable privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent
disclosure of any such communications to any third party.

  

(b)  Recognizing that each of Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Kirkland
and Ellis International LLP (collectively, " _K andE_") has acted as legal
counsel to Sellers, their Affiliates and the Target Companies prior to the
Closing, and that KandE intends to act as legal counsel to Sellers and their
Affiliates after the Closing, Purchaser, Pubco and the Company (on its own
behalf and on behalf of each Target Company) hereby waives, and agrees to
cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with KandE representing Sellers and/or their Affiliates after the Closing as
such representation may relate to Purchaser, any Target Company or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents.
All communications involving attorney-client confidences between any Seller,
any of its Affiliates or any Target Company and KandE in the course of the
preparations, planning, negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to Sellers. Accordingly, the Target Companies
shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of KandE
relating to engagement, if the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) Sellers shall
be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Target Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii)
to the extent that files of KandE in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only Sellers (and not the Target Companies)
shall hold such property rights and (iii) KandE shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any
of the Target Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
KandE and any of the Target Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Target
Companies or any of their Affiliates and a third party (other than a Party or
any of its Affiliates) after the Closing, the Target Companies may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential attorney-
client communications by KandE to such third party.
