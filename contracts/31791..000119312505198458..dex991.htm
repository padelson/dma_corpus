the Working Capital (as defined in this Section 1.4(a)) of the Business as of
the Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital Amount_ "). PKI shall conduct
full physical inventories as of the Closing Date within 30 calendar days
prior to or following the Closing Date, and the results of such inventories,
after appropriately adjusting for intervening activity between the date of
such physical inventories and the Closing Date, shall be used in preparing
the Closing Working Capital Statement. Representatives of PKI and Buyer will
be permitted to observe the physical inventories. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Working Capital_ " shall mean the current assets of the Business
as of the Closing Date (including accounts receivable (net of allowance for
doubtful accounts), inventory (net of reserve for excess and obsolete
inventory but excluding the LIFO reserve and the related LIFO excess and
obsolete reserve adjustment) and other current assets, excluding prepaid
Taxes and deferred Tax assets, investments and cash and cash equivalents,
which cash and cash equivalents shall be distributed to, or retained by,
Sellers prior to the Closing), less the current liabilities of the Business

excluding Tax liabilities, deferred Taxes, restructuring liabilities, capital
lease obligations, accrued management incentives, employee labor costs for
employees of the business who are not Transferred Employees, accrued Pension
costs for employees of the Business who work primarily at the Warwick, Rhode

-18-  liabilities), and shall be calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP on a
basis consistent with PKIs accounting methods, treatments, principles
and procedures used in the preparation of the Financial Statements referred
to in Section 2.6 of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Working
Capital shall exclude all Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities.



(b) If Buyer in good faith disputes the Closing Working Capital Amount
as shown on the Closing Working Capital Statement prepared by PKI, Buyer
shall deliver to PKI within 60 days after receipt of the Closing Working
Capital Statement a statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth
Buyers calculation of the correct Closing Working Capital Amount and
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such
different Closing Working Capital Amount. The Parties shall use reasonable
efforts to resolve such differences regarding the determination of the
Closing Working Capital Amount for a period of 30 days after Buyer has given
the Dispute Notice. If the Parties resolve such differences, the Closing
Working Capital Amount agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the "
_Final Closing Working Capital Amount_ " and the Closing Working Capital
Statement agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the " _Final Closing
Working Capital Statement_."



(c) If the Parties do not reach a final resolution on the Closing
Working Capital Amount within 30 days after Buyer has given the Dispute
Notice, unless the Parties mutually agree to continue their efforts to resolve
such differences, KPMG LLP (the " _Neutral Accountant_ ") shall resolve such
differences, pursuant to an engagement agreement executed by the Parties and
the Neutral Accountant, in the manner provided below. The Parties shall each
be entitled to make a presentation to the Neutral Accountant, pursuant to
procedures to be agreed to among PKI, Buyer and the Neutral Accountant (or,
if they cannot agree on such procedures, pursuant to procedures determined by
the Neutral Accountant), regarding such Partys  



 

-19-  calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount; and the Neutral
Accountant shall be required to resolve the differences between the Parties
and determine the Closing Working Capital Amount within twenty (20) Business
Days after such presentations have been made. The Closing Working Capital
Amount determined by the Neutral Accountant shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Working Capital Amount and the Closing Working Capital Statement, as
adjusted to reflect such determination, shall be deemed to be the Final
Closing Working Capital Statement. Such determination by the Neutral
Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent fraud or
manifest error.



(d) The Neutral Accountant shall not be authorized or permitted to:



(i) determine any questions or matters whatsoever under or in connection with
this Agreement except for the resolution of differences between the Parties
regarding the determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount in
accordance with this Section 1.4; 



(ii) resolve any such differences by making an adjustment to the Closing
Working Capital Statement that is outside of the range defined by amounts as
finally proposed by the Parties; or



(iii) apply any accounting methods, treatments, principles or procedures other
than as described in Section 1.4(a).



(e) PKI, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall each pay
one half of the fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant; provided that if
the Neutral Accountant determines that one Party has adopted a position or
positions with respect to the Closing Working Capital Statement that is
frivolous or clearly without merit, the Neutral Accountant (i) may, in its
discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such
Party and  



 

-20-  (ii) shall provide to the Parties a written explanation of its reasons for
making such a determination.



(f) The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section 1.4 for
resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Working Capital Amount shall be
the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes, provided that
this provision shall not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to
enforce the ruling of the Neutral Accountant.



(g) Failure of Buyer to deliver a Dispute Notice within 60 days after
receiving the Closing Working Capital Statement shall constitute acceptance of
the Closing Working Capital Amount set forth on the Closing Working Capital
Statement, whereupon such Closing Working Capital Amount shall be deemed to
be the Final Closing Working Capital Amount and the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Working Capital Statement.
Delivery by Buyer of a Dispute Notice shall constitute final and binding
acceptance by Buyer of all portions of the Closing Working Capital Statement
other than those specifically identified in the Dispute Notice as being
subject to a good faith dispute.



(h) If the Final Closing Working Capital Amount is less than $22,900,000,
as adjusted to exclude all Tax assets and liabilities of Sellers and PKI
Indonesia as of the Balance Sheet Date, including without limitation accrued
payroll taxes, accrued real estate taxes, accrued personal property taxes,
accrued sales and use taxes, accrued employment taxes and accrued value-added
taxes (the " _Target Working Capital Amount_ "), then PKI shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to the difference between the Target Working Capital Amount
and the Final Closing Working Capital Amount. If the Final Closing Working
Capital Amount is more than the Target Working Capital Amount, then Buyer
shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the difference between the Final
Closing Working Capital Amount and the Target Working Capital  



 

-21-  Amount. Any payment pursuant to this Section 1.4(h) shall be made in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account or
accounts designated by the Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, within five
Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing Working Capital Amount
is determined pursuant to this Section 1.4.



(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ " means the
Purchase Price plus, if applicable, the amount of the payment required to be
made by Buyer to PKI pursuant to the second sentence of Section 1.4(h) or
minus, if applicable, the amount of the payment required to be made by PKI to
Buyer pursuant to the first sentence of Section 1.4(h).



1.5 _Consents to Assignment_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any asset, agreement, lease, authorization, license or permit, or
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, if an
attempted assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party
thereto or of the issuing Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 2.4(b)),
as the case may be, would constitute a breach or default thereof, would
result in a violation of the rights of any such third party, would be
ineffective, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of PKI or Buyer
thereunder. If such consent (a " _Deferred Consent_ ") is not obtained, then
(a) the asset, agreement, lease, authorization, license or permit to which
such Deferred Consent relates (a "Deferred Item") shall be withheld from sale
pursuant to this Agreement without any reduction in the Purchase Price, (b)
from and after the Closing, the Sellers and Buyer will cooperate, in all
reasonable respects, to obtain such Deferred Consent as soon as practicable
after the Closing, provided that (i) no Party shall be required to make any
material payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection
therewith and (ii) if the Parties agree to make any payments (whether or not
material) to a third party to obtain a  



 

-22-  Deferred Consent, all such payments that are made shall be paid one half
(1/2) by the Buyer and one half (1/2) by PKI, and (c) until such Deferred
Consent is obtained, the Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate, in all
reasonable respects, in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement
reasonably proposed by the Buyer under which (i) the Buyer would obtain
(without infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic
claims, rights and benefits (net of the amount of any related Tax costs and
any other liabilities or obligations imposed on the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates under the Deferred Item) and (ii) the Buyer would assume any
related economic burden (including the amount of any related Tax costs and any
other liabilities or obligations imposed on the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates) with respect to the Deferred Item. 



1.6 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, as and when reasonably requested by any Party hereto and at such Partys
expense (it being understood that such Party shall be required to reimburse
only out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties, and not internal costs),
the other Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are necessary
to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all material respects. PKI
Indonesia and each Asset Seller has paid (or had paid on its behalf) all
Taxes (as defined below) that are shown to be due on any such Tax Returns. All
Taxes that PKI Indonesia and each Asset Seller is or was required by law to
withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent
required, have been paid to the proper Governmental Entity, except for any
such Taxes with respect to which the failure to withhold, collect or pay would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Taxes_ " means all taxes, including
income, gross receipts, _ad valorem_ , value-added, excise, real property,
personal property, sales, use, transfer, withholding, employment and franchise
taxes imposed by the United States of America or any state, local or foreign
government, or any agency thereof, or other political subdivision of the

of PKI Indonesia were included on the Tax Return of such group) by any
Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to Sellers knowledge,
threatened or contemplated. None of PKI Indonesia or the  



 

-32-  members of any consolidated, combined or unitary group with which PKI
Indonesia has filed group Tax Returns has been notified in writing by any

(c) PKI Indonesia has not been a member of a group with which it has filed or
been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other

Indonesia is not liable for the Taxes of any taxpayer as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise for any Pre-Closing Period.

of time within which to file any Tax Return.

open is for the taxable year ending December 31, 2002. Schedule 2.9(g) lists
all income Tax Returns filed with respect to PKI Indonesia for all taxable
periods for which the statute of limitations is still open, and indicates
those Tax Returns that have been audited and those that are currently the
subject of an audit. PKI has delivered or made available to the Buyer correct
and complete copies of (i) all income Tax Returns of PKI Indonesia with
respect to all taxable periods for which the statute of limitations is still
open, and (ii) copies of all examination reports and statements of
deficiencies that have been assessed against or agreed to by PKI Indonesia for
any past taxable period for which the statute of limitations is still open.



(h) There are no joint ventures, partnerships, limited liability companies, or
other arrangements or contracts to which PKI Indonesia is a party and that
could be treated as a partnership for income Tax purposes by any jurisdiction.



(i) The unpaid Taxes of PKI Indonesia (A) did not, as of the Balance Sheet

Closing Date in accordance with GAAP in the ordinary course of business.

Agreement will not adversely affect the amount or availability to PKI
Indonesia of any such Tax credit, Tax holiday, or other Tax benefit or
attribute.

(i) the Lease is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
applicable Asset Seller or PKI Indonesia (as the case may be) and, to Sellers
knowledge, each other party to such Lease, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by equitable principles, including those limiting the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and those providing for equitable defenses;



(ii) no Asset Seller or PKI Indonesia or, to Sellers knowledge, any other
party to the Lease is in breach or default and, to Sellers knowledge, no

acceleration thereunder, except for any such breach or default as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect; and

conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered any interest in the

in material default under any such agreement.



(d) Other than rights and licenses granted in the ordinary course of business,
none of the Asset Sellers or PKI Indonesia or any of their

(f) to the extent resulting from any Taxes relating to a period (or portion

6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_. 



(a) _Third-Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party (as defined in this Section 6.3(a)) shall be made
in accordance with the following procedures. A person entitled
to indemnification under this Article VI (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall
give prompt written notification to the person from whom indemnification is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the commencement of any action, suit
or proceeding relating to a third-party claim for which indemnification may be
sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such claim by a third party.
Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying
Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume
control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.  



 

-67-  If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Party not controlling such
defense may participate therein at its own expense; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to
such action, suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be
considered " _Damages_ " for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties.
The Party controlling such defense shall keep the other Party advised of the
status of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider recommendations made by the other Party with respect thereto.
The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes
any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. 



(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this Article VI which is not subject to
Section 6.3(a) shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "
_Claimed Amount_ ") of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under  



 

-68-  this Article VI and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and
(iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages. Within 30 days
after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall:
(I) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in which case such response shall be accompanied by a payment by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or
by wire transfer), (II) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ")
(in which case such response shall be accompanied by a payment by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or
by wire transfer), or (III) contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive any of the Claimed Amount. If the Indemnifying Party in such response
contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed Amount, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such
dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 60 days following the delivery
by the Indemnifying Party of such response, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.14.



6.4 _Survival_.



(a) The representations and warranties of PKI and Buyer set forth in this
Agreement and the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections
5.1(d) and 5.2(d) shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and continue until the date that is eighteen
months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall expire.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the representations and warranties of PKI
contained in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 and of Buyer contained in Sections 3.1
and 3.2 shall survive the Closing

limitation, (ii) the representations and warranties of PKI contained
in Section 2.29 shall survive until the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, (iii) the representations and warranties of PKI contained in Sections
2.17 and 2.24 shall expire upon the occurrence of the Closing, (iv) the

expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions
of the statute of limitations and (v) the representation and warranty of PKI
contained in Section 2.9(e) shall survive the Closing Date and continue until
the date that is three years after the Closing Date, at which time they shall
expire.



(b) None of the covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing Date other than those which by their
terms contemplate performance after the Closing Date, and each such surviving
covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing only until the expiration of
the term of the undertaking set forth in such agreement and covenant.



(c) No Party shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with
respect to any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant after the
termination thereof.



(d) Any valid claim that is properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section
6.3 prior to the expiration as provided in Section 6.4(a) of
the representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim shall survive
until such claim is finally resolved and satisfied.



6.5 _Limitations_.



(a) Subject to Section 11.13 and except with respect to claims made pursuant
to Article VIII or Article IX, from and after the Closing, the rights of the
Indemnified Parties under this Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Indemnified Parties and their  



 

-70-  respective Affiliates with respect to claims resulting from any breach of
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement. Subject to Section 11.13, from and after the Closing, the
rights of Buyer and Sellers under Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Buyer and Sellers with respect to the subject matter of Article
VIII. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing two sentences, in no
event shall Buyer, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or
seek rescission of the transactions consummated under this Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the following four limitations shall apply to any claims under Section
6.1(a), provided that the limitations set forth in paragraphs (i), (ii), and
(iii) below shall not apply to any Damages resulting from a breach of the
representations set forth in Section 2.9 (relating to Taxes) or as a result of
the indemnity set forth in Section 6.1(c) (relating to Taxes):



(i) the aggregate liability of PKI for all Damages under Section 6.1(a) and
Article VIII shall not exceed $100,000,000;



(ii) no individual claim or series of related claims for indemnification
under Sections 6.1(a)(i), 6.2(a)(i) or 8.2(a) shall be valid and assertable
unless it is (or they are) for an amount in excess of $25,000;



(iii) PKI shall not be liable under Sections 6.1(a)(i) and 8.2(a) unless
the aggregate Damages under such sections, considered together exceeds
$3,000,000, and then PKI shall be liable for all such Damages starting from
the first dollar; and



(iv) Buyer shall not be entitled to make any claim for indemnification with
respect to any matter to the extent the Purchase Price has been adjusted to
reflect such  



 

-71-  matter pursuant to Section 1.4, and the amount of any Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VI, or under Articles VIII or
IX, shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves or provisions reflected
in the Final Closing Working Capital Statement relating thereto; provided,
however, that the limitations of Section 6.5(b) shall not apply to any claim
described in paragraph (b) of Section 6.1 or paragraphs (b) through (d) of
Section 6.2.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, PKI
shall not be liable for any Damages resulting from a breach of
the representation set forth in Section 2.9(e) to the extent such Damages
arise from or are otherwise attributable to any operations of the Business
after December 31, 2006.



(d) In the case of Damages relating to claims made pursuant to Article VIII or
Section 6.1(b) with respect to those Excluded Liabilities set forth in
Section 1.1(e)(vii), PKI shall be liable for only that portion of the
aggregate Damages under such Article or Section, as the case may be, which
exceeds $500,000 (it being understood that PKI shall not be liable, in any
event, for the first $500,000 of said Damages).



(e) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible and liable for any
Damages or other amounts under this Article VI or under Article VIII that are
(i) consequential, in the nature of lost profits, diminutions in
value, special or punitive or otherwise not actual Damages or (ii)
contingent, unless and until such Damages are actual and mature. Buyer shall
(and shall cause the Business to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue all legal rights and remedies available in order to minimize the
Damages for which indemnification is provided to Buyer by PKI under Articles
VI or VIII.



(f) Sellers shall not have any right of contribution against the Business with
respect to any breach by PKI of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements  



 

-72-  set forth in this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby
waives and releases (and shall cause PKI Indonesia to waive and release), any
claim that PKI Indonesia may have against any Seller or their respective
Affiliates, other than any claims arising out of commercial sales by or to the
Business by the Seller or its Affiliates other than PKI Indonesia.



(g) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Article VI or under Article VIII shall be reduced by any related
recoveries to which the Indemnified Party is entitled under insurance policies
or other related payments received or receivable from third parties and any
Tax benefits actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates or for which the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is
eligible on account of the matter resulting in such Damages or the payment of
such Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue, and to cause its Affiliates to pursue, (i) all insurance claims
under insurance policies (A) the premiums for which were paid by any Seller
prior to the Closing Date and (B) that are occurrence based, whether or not
the premiums for such policies were paid by any Seller prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) Tax benefits to which it may be entitled in connection with any
Damages it incurs, and each of Buyer, Seller and the Indemnified Party with
respect to any indemnification claim shall cooperate with each other in
pursuing insurance claims with respect to any Damages or any indemnification
obligations with respect to Damages. If an Indemnified Party (or
an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment (without regard to whether the
premiums for the policy under which such payment is made was paid by any
Seller prior to the Closing Date) in connection with any claim for Damages for
which it has already received an indemnification payment from the
Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within 10 days of
receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the
amount previously received by the  



 

-73-  Indemnified Party under this Article VI with respect to such claim plus the
amount of the insurance payments received, over (ii) the amount of
Damages with respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has become
entitled to receive under this Article VI.



6.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price.

writing by Buyer prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, except
for any claims by third parties for Environmental Remediation at the Warwick,
Rhode Island, Phelps, New York and Beltsville, Maryland facilities, which must
be properly asserted prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date.



(c) Any liability of PKI under Section 8.2(a) shall be reduced to the extent

(d) The Parties acknowledge that any claims that arise under Environmental

not by this Article VIII.



(e) The Parties agree that any voluntary action, program or expense
incurred under or related to Environmental Laws shall not be deemed a
mandatory obligation for purposes of Section 8.2(a). In addition, Buyer shall
not be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII if a mandatory

party (other than an Affiliate of Buyer) of information or data, except to the
extent that it would be unlawful, or would present a significant and imminent
risk to human health, to not provide such information to that third party.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
the Sellers become obligated pursuant to Section 8.2 to conduct, indemnify the
Buyer for, or to pay Damages, on account of, any investigation or remediation
of a Business Property, the Sellers obligations hereunder shall be satisfied
by and limited to investigation or remediation of Materials of Environmental
Concern at such property to industrial usage levels, or industrial risk-  



 

-78-  based cleanup standards under applicable Environmental Law based upon future
industrial use of such property.



(g) This Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of (i) Buyer and
its Affiliates against Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, and

against Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and their respective present or former
officers, directors and employee, agents, attorneys or contractors, for any
and all claims, Damages or other matters (other than with respect to an
Excluded Liability) related directly or indirectly to the Business
constituting Environmental Matters.



(h) Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, hereby waive (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates and the respective successors and
assigns of Buyer, Sellers and their respective Affiliates to waive) any right
to seek contribution or other recovery from each other or their respective
Affiliates or any present or former officer, director or employee, agent
attorney or contractor of Buyer, Sellers or any of their respective
subsidiaries with respect to events related directly or indirectly to the
Business prior to the Closing that Buyer and its Affiliates or any of them may
now or in the future have under any Environmental Law or any common law
providing for any remedy or right of recovery with respect to Environmental
Matters or Materials of Environmental Concern other than as expressly provided
for in this Article VIII. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, hereby release (and shall cause their respective Affiliates and the
respective successors and assigns of Buyer, Sellers and their respective
Affiliates to release) each other and their respective Affiliates and all
present or former officers, directors and employees, agents, attorneys
or contractors of Buyer, Sellers or any of their respective subsidiaries from
any and all such claims, demands and causes of action.



 

-79- 8.4 _Environmental Indemnification by Buyer_.

respect of, and hold Sellers and their respective Affiliates harmless against,
any and all Damages arising from or related to Environmental Matters related
directly or indirectly to Buyers ownership or operation of the Business or
the Business Properties after the Closing as to which PKI is not obligated to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2(a). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
is not indemnifying Sellers and their respective Affiliates for any
Environmental Matters related to ownership or operation of the Business or the
Business Properties prior to the Closing Date. 



(b) The procedures set forth in Section 6.3 shall apply with respect to any
claim for indemnification made by Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 8.4.



ARTICLE IX



TAX MATTERS



9.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.



(a) For any period ending on or before Closing, PKI shall submit the Tax
Returns for PKI Indonesia (and such additional information regarding such Tax
Returns as may reasonably be requested by Buyer) to Buyer (and PKI Indonesia)
for filing at least twenty (20) business days in advance of the due date of
such filing to allow Buyer and PKI Indonesia to review, comment, and object to
such Tax Return based on the Buyers reasonable review thereof. All such PKI
Indonesia Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with historical
practice, except to the extent otherwise required by law. In the event of any
objection by Buyer,  



 

-80-  Buyer and PKI shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to resolve such
objection to the reasonable satisfaction of both parties and, if they are
unable to resolve such dispute within five (5) business days, Buyer shall
file such Tax Return in the manner prescribed by PKI; provided, however, that
if Buyer is advised by counsel that the filing of any Tax Return and the
reporting on such Tax Return in the manner proposed by PKI may subject Buyer
to any penalties, Buyer may file such Tax Return in a manner which shall be as
consistent as possible with the position taken by PKI but which would not
subject Buyer or PKI Indonesia to a material risk of the imposition of
penalties in the view of such counsel. PKI shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns for Sellers for all periods
(including the consolidated, unitary, and combined Tax Returns for Sellers
which include the operations of the Business for any period ending on or
before the Closing Date) and for all Tax Returns of PKI Indonesia for all
taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date. Sellers shall make or
cause to be made all payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns.
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Sellers for the amount of any such Taxes paid
by Sellers to the extent such Taxes are attributable (as determined under
Section 9.2 hereof) to periods following the Closing Date.



(b) Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all other
Tax Returns for the Business. Buyer shall make all payments required with
respect to any such Tax Returns, provided that PKI shall be responsible for
such portion of such Taxes as required pursuant to Sections 6.1(c) and 9.2(c)
hereof.



(c) Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed for taxable periods beginning
before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return, and Buyer shall
consult with PKI concerning each such Tax Return and report all items with
respect to the period ending on the Closing Date in  



 

-81-  accordance with the instructions of PKI; provided, however, that if Buyer is
advised by counsel that the filing of any Tax Return and the reporting on
such Tax Return of any item in accordance with the instructions of PKI may
subject Buyer to any penalties, Buyer may file such Tax Return without regard
to PKIs instructions relating to such item. Buyer shall provide PKI with a
copy of each proposed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding
such Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by PKI) at least 20 days prior
to the filing of such Tax Return.



(d) Buyer and PKI shall share the payment of any transfer, sales, use, stamp,
conveyance, value added, recording, registration, documentary, filing and
other non-income Taxes and administrative fees (including notary fees) arising
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the manner contemplated by Section 4.1(b) hereof.



(e) Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any and all Taxes not
incurred in the ordinary course of business attributable to the acts or
omissions of Buyer or Buyers Affiliates occurring after the Closing on the
Closing Date.



9.2 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_.



(a) Buyer and PKI agree that if any Seller or PKI Indonesia is permitted
but not required under applicable foreign, state or local Tax laws to treat
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, Buyer and Sellers shall
treat such day as the last day of a taxable period.



(b) Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date with respect to the Business shall be
remitted by Buyer, and the Taxes for such period shall be apportioned for
purposes of Section 9.1 between Sellers and Buyer based on the provisions of
Section 9.2(c) hereof.



 

-82- (c) For purposes of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, Section
6.1(c)):



(i) Sellers shall retain all obligations and liabilities for Taxes (A)
related to any period that ends on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing
Period_ ") and (B) arising as a result of any transfer of assets described on
_Schedule 4.3_.



(ii) Buyer shall be responsible for all obligations and liabilities for Taxes
related to any period that ends after the Closing Date, other than Taxes
described in Section 9.2(c)(i).



(iii) In the case of any income or gross receipts Taxes of PKI Indonesia that
are payable with respect to a taxable period beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes relating to a Pre-
Closing Period shall be determined on the basis of a closing of the books and
records of PKI Indonesia as of the Closing Date.



(iv) In the case of any Taxes (other than income or gross receipts
Taxes) that are payable with respect to a taxable period beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes relating to a Pre-
Closing Period shall be equal to the product of all such Taxes multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
from the commencement of such period through and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period;
provided however that appropriate adjustments shall be made to reflect
specific events that can be identified and allocated as occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date or occurring after the Closing Date.



 

-83- 9.3 _Refunds and Carrybacks_.



(a) Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds (including any interest paid
thereon) or credits of Taxes of PKI Indonesia attributable to taxable periods
ending (or deemed pursuant to Section 9.2(c) to end) on or before the Closing
Date.



(b) Buyer and/or its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be entitled to any
refunds (including any interest paid thereon) or credits of Taxes of
PKI Indonesia attributable to taxable periods beginning (or deemed pursuant
to Section 9.2(c) to begin) after the Closing Date.



(c) Buyer shall forward to or reimburse PKI for any refunds (including any
interest paid thereon) or credits due Sellers after receipt thereof, and
PKI shall promptly forward to Buyer or reimburse Buyer for any refunds
(including any interest paid thereon) or credits due Buyer after receipt
thereof.



(d) Buyer and PKI agree that, with respect to any Tax, PKI Indonesia shall not
carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit which arises in any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date to any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date.



9.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits_.



(a) Buyer and PKI and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the
preparation of all Tax Returns for any Tax periods for which any such party
could reasonably require the assistance of another such party in obtaining
any necessary information. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited
to, furnishing prior years Tax Returns or return preparation packages to the
extent related to the Business illustrating previous reporting practices or
containing historical information relevant to the preparation of such Tax
Returns, and furnishing such other information within such partys possession
requested by the party filing such Tax Returns as is relevant to their
preparation. Such cooperation and information also shall  



 

-84-  include provision of powers of attorney for the purpose of signing Tax
Returns and defending audits and promptly forwarding copies of appropriate
notices and forms or other communications received from or sent to any
applicable governmental authority responsible for the imposition of Taxes (the
" _Taxing Authority_ ") which relate to the Business, and providing copies of
all relevant Tax Returns to the extent related to the Business, together with
accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by any Taxing Authority and records concerning the
ownership and Tax basis of property, which the requested party may possess.
Buyer and PKI and their respective Affiliates shall make their respective
employees and facilities available on a mutually convenient basis to explain
any documents or information provided hereunder. 



(b) _Tax Audits_.



(i) Sellers shall have the right, at their own expense, to control any
audit or examination by any Taxing Authority (" _Tax Audit_ "), initiate any
claim for refund, contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice
of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to any and
all Taxes for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date with
respect to the Business. Buyer shall have the right, at its own expense, to
control any other Tax Audit, initiate any other claim for refund, and contest,
resolve and defend against any other assessment, notice of deficiency, or
other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to Taxes with respect to the
Business; provided that, with respect to (A) any state, local or foreign Taxes
for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date and (B) any item the adjustment of which may cause any Seller to
become obligated to make any payment pursuant to Section 9.2(c) hereof, Buyer
shall consult with PKI with respect to the resolution of any issue that would
affect any Seller, and not settle any such  



 

-85-  issue, or file any amended Tax Return relating to such issue, without the
consent of PKI. Where consent to a settlement is withheld by PKI pursuant to
this Section, PKI may continue or initiate any further proceedings at its own
expense, provided that any liability of Buyer, after giving effect to this
Agreement, shall not exceed the liability that would have resulted had PKI not
withheld its consent. 



(ii) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Buyer shall have the sole right to control and make all decisions
in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes of
PKI Indonesia, including selection of counsel and selection of a forum for
such contest, provided, however, that in the event such audit or proceeding
relates to Taxes for which Sellers are responsible and have agreed to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof, (A) Buyer and Sellers shall
cooperate in the conduct of any audit or proceeding relating to such period,
(B) Sellers shall have the right to participate in such audit or proceeding at
Sellers expense, (C) Buyer shall not enter into any agreement with the
relevant taxing authority pertaining to such Taxes without the written
consent of Sellers, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, and (D)
Buyer may, without the written consent of Sellers, enter into such an
agreement provided that Buyer shall have agreed in writing to forego any
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Taxes. In the event
of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 9.4(b)(ii) and any
other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 9.4(b)(ii)
shall control.



9.5 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Business shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, Buyer and
its Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder
for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.



 

-86- 9.6 _Certain Elections under Code Section 338_. If Buyer would like to make an
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the
acquisition of the Stock of PKI Indonesia, it shall notify PKI of such
decision on or before the later of December 15, 2005 and the fifth Business
Day following the Closing. If Buyer provides such notice to PKI, then Buyer
shall make such election, upon written consent of PKI, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. PKI shall notify Buyer as to
whether or not it consents to such election within five Business Days of the
receipt of the notice from Buyer. If Seller would like Buyer to make an
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the
acquisition of the Stock of PKI Indonesia, it shall notify Buyer of such
decision on or before the later of December 15, 2005 and the fifth Business
Day following the Closing. If PKI provides such notice to Buyer, and Buyer
provides its written consent to make such election, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, then Buyer shall make such
election. Buyer shall notify PKI as to whether or not it consents to such
election within five Business Days of the receipt of the notice from PKI.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer or PKI be required to
notify the other as to whether or not it consents to an election pursuant to
Section 338(g) of the Code pursuant to this Section 9.6 prior to December 15,
2005.

exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of disclosure compelled
by judicial or administrative process, the Receiving Party shall (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) notify the Disclosing Party promptly of
the request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this

time prior to the Closing Date, except for any changes that may be required

sealing valve and pneumatic products or systems or  



 

-91-  ducting products for the aerospace and industrial market, or design or
manufacture support services for aircraft engine manufacturers or airframe
OEMs (a " _Competitive Business_ "); provided, however, that the foregoing
covenants shall not prohibit, or be interpreted as prohibiting, any
Noncompetition Party from:



(i) continuing anywhere in the world in any type of business conducted by any
Noncompetition Party on the date hereof, which is not part of the Business or
the PKL Business;



(ii) entering into any relationship with a person or entity not owned,
managed, operated or controlled by any Noncompetition Party for purposes
primarily unrelated to a Competitive Business;

Competitive Business, provided such investments do not confer control of any
such Competitive Business upon any Noncompetition Party; or

of such person or entity from its Competitive Business do not constitute more

Noncompetition Party in its sole discretion.

other than (i) general recruiting and general advertisements or solicitations
not targeted at such employees or (ii) employees whose employment with the

10.4 _Disclosure Generally_.



(a) Any information furnished in the Disclosure Schedule (or any
update thereto) shall be deemed to modify all of PKIs representations and
warranties to which it is reasonably apparent that such information relates.
The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule (or any update
thereto) shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed,
is material to the Business, has resulted in or would result in a Business
Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of business. For
purposes of this Agreement, the terms "to Sellers knowledge," "to the
knowledge of the Sellers", "known by Sellers" or other words of similar
meaning shall mean the actual knowledge of the persons listed on _Schedule
10.4(a)_ attached hereto.



(b) PKI shall be entitled to submit to Buyer, from time to time between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, written updates to the Disclosure Schedule
disclosing any  



 

-93-  events or developments that occur or any information learned between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. If the new information disclosed
on any such update to the Disclosure Schedule (such information, the " _New
Disclosure_ ") would cause the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1(b) or
5.1(h) not to be satisfied (whether or not Buyer ultimately raises the failure
of such condition to be satisfied), then PKIs representations and warranties
contained in Article II shall be construed for all purposes of this Agreement
(including by limiting Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to Article
VI) in accordance with the Disclosure Schedule, as so updated. If the New
Disclosure would not cause the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1(b) or
5.1(h) not to be satisfied, then the New Disclosure shall have no qualifying
effect on PKIs representations and warranties contained in Article II or
Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to Article VI.



10.5 _Acknowledgments by Buyer_. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY PKI AND
PKI FRANCE CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF PKI AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY (INCLUDING ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL
FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE
BUSINESS AND ANY SET FORTH IN THE CONFIDENTIAL DESCRIPTIVE MEMORANDUM
PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED TO BUYER), ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY PKI AND ITS
SUBSIDIARIES. BUYER ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW IN THE
CASE OF THE  



 

-94-  SALE OF THE PORTION OF THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY PKI FRANCE, ITS SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE RECOURSE IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT IS TO ASSERT RIGHTS OF BUYER PURSUANT TO ARTICLE VI, ARTICLE VIII
AND ARTICLE IX.



10.6 _Certain Employee Benefits Matters_.



(a) On or before the Closing, Buyer shall offer employment to all US Business
Employees who are not covered by Business Collective Bargaining Agreements,
except the Inactive US Business Employees to whom Buyer will make offers of
employment upon the termination of any disability, layoff, or leave of absence
within the six-month period following the Closing Date. Each such offer of
employment shall be on the same base pay or rate of pay and conditions
of employment substantially similar in aggregate value, including any
applicable post retirement medical benefits, to the existing terms and
conditions of each such US Business Employees employment prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that all pension and welfare benefits and benefit
arrangements shall be provided under plans of Buyer (" _Buyer s Plans_"). US
Business Employees who are covered by a Business Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall be employed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of such Business
Collective Bargaining Agreement. All US Business Employees who accept such
offers of employment of Buyer or who otherwise become employed by Buyer (the "
_Transferred Employees_ ") will become employees of Buyer (with the effect
that no period of unemployment will occur with respect to any such Transferred
Employees). Buyer shall be solely responsible for all compensation and
benefits accrued or benefit claims filed by Transferred Employees on and
after the Closing. The Asset Sellers will retain all liability for such
benefits accrued or claims filed by US Business Employees prior to the
Closing. In addition, Asset Sellers shall retain all obligations for benefits
accrued and benefit  



 

-95-  claims filed by any Inactive Business Employee prior to employment by Buyer
as a Transferred Employee and for benefits accrued and benefit claims filed
by any US Business Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee. Any
Buyers Plan in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate shall
provide that for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting
and for any schedule of benefits based on service (but not pension benefit
amounts), all service with Asset Sellers and any predecessor that is
recognized by Asset Sellers shall be recognized. Buyers Plans which provide
medical, dental, vision, and health benefits to Transferred Employees shall
provide such benefits without the applicability of any pre-existing physical
or mental condition restrictions (other than those in effect on the Closing
Date under a US Business Welfare Plan) and to the extent that a Transferred
Employee has satisfied in whole or in part any annual deductible amount with
respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs or paid any
expenses pursuant to a co-insurance provision under a US Business Welfare
Plan on the Closing Date, such Transferred Employee shall be credited with
such amounts under the applicable Buyers Plan.



(b) Buyer agrees that it shall assume any collective bargaining agreements
entered into with respect to US Business Employees (a " _Business Collective
Bargaining Agreement_ "); provided, however, that such obligation shall be
subject to Buyer negotiating provisions relating to pension benefits and other
benefits obligations (but not changes to wages or other terms and
conditions of employment) reasonably satisfactory to Buyer prior to the
Closing Date. PKI shall use its best efforts to assist Buyer in negotiating
such changes to the Business Collective Bargaining Agreement.



(c) Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ ") and any other similar
applicable law and to  



 

-96-  otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing"
or "mass layoff (as defined in WARN) or similar event affecting employees
and occurring on or after the Closing Date or arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers and their Affiliates with respect to any liability under WARN or
other similar applicable law arising from the actions (or in actions) of
Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date or arising as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby.



(d) Asset Sellers shall be solely responsible for all workers compensation
claims made by US Business Employees, including Transferred Employees, with
respect to injuries or conditions occurring or sustained prior to the Closing.
Buyer shall be solely responsible for all workers compensation claims made by
Transferred Employees with respect to injuries or conditions occurring or
sustained after the Closing.



(e) Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under COBRA and any other
similar applicable law on or after the Closing Date with respect to
Transferred Employees. Buyer shall assume all liabilities for post-employment
health coverage under COBRA or otherwise with respect to Transferred
Employees. Asset Sellers shall retain all responsibility and liability for
post-employment health coverage under COBRA and any similar applicable law
with respect to US Business Employees who do not become Transferred
Employees.



(f) Buyer shall employ all Foreign Business Employees employed by any Asset
Seller, PKI Indonesia, or PKI France on and after the Closing Date on the
terms and conditions on which they were employed by such Asset Seller, PKI
Indonesia, or PKI France. Buyer shall offer employment to all other Foreign
Business Employees on and after the Closing Date on generally comparable terms
and conditions, subject to applicable law.



 

-97- 10.7 _Resignations_. Effective upon the Closing, PKI shall cause all of its
own employees, directors and attorneys and all of its Affiliates (other than
PKI Indonesia) employees, directors and attorneys to resign from the board of
directors of PKI Indonesia and from all positions as executive officers of PKI
Indonesia.



10.8 _Use of Name for Transition Period_.



(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall amend
the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents
of PKI Indonesia to exclude any reference to "PerkinElmer" alone or in
combination with any other words or terms or variation of such words or terms.



(b) Following the Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, Buyer shall have no rights to use any trademarks, tradenames, logos
or any contraction, abbreviation or simulation of any Seller (the " _Retained
Marks_ ") and will not hold itself out as having any affiliations with any
Seller. 



(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.8(a) and (b), for a period
of 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer may (i) utilize sales promotional
aids, literature and other printed material transferred by the Sellers to
Buyer on the Closing Date and containing the Retained Marks, (ii) sell
inventory transferred to Buyer as part of the Acquired Assets, that contain or
incorporate the Retained Marks, and (iii) manufacture and sell products that
contain or incorporate Retained Marks; provided that promptly following the
Closing Date, Buyer will implement a plan to eliminate the use of all such
material within such 90-day period.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.8,
Buyer, upon written consent of PKI, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
shall have an additional period of (i) 90 days to comply with the requirements
of Section 10.8(c), but only with  



 

-98-  respect to those items that cannot reasonably, after diligent efforts, be
accomplished within the initial 90-day period because it is impractical to do
so or because of the inaction or delay by a governmental authority; and (ii)
90 days to comply with the requirements of Section 10.8(c) above, but only
with respect to those items that cannot reasonably, after diligent efforts, be
accomplished within the initial 90-day period because such changes require
Federal Aviation Administration or other airworthiness approvals.



(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.8, Buyer may disclose to its
customers and potential customers that it is conducting the Business as a
successor to the Sellers from and after the Closing Date.



(f) The licenses to use the Retained Marks set forth in this Section 10.8
shall not prohibit PKI or any of its Affiliates from using the Retained Marks
(or any similar name or logo) during the term of the respective license
or thereafter in any manner. The Buyer agrees that its use of the Retained
Marks shall be consistent with the past practices of the Sellers and their
respective direct and indirect subsidiaries in connection with their business
and operations and, with respect to such use, Buyer shall adhere to
substantially similar quality standards to which the Sellers and their direct
and indirect subsidiaries adhered immediately prior to the Closing.



10.9 _Seller Guarantees_. If any Seller Guarantee is not replaced
and released as of the Closing as provided in Section 4.2, the Buyer shall
fulfill all obligations of the applicable Seller and/or its Affiliates under
such Seller Guarantees and shall reimburse the Sellers and their Affiliates
for all premiums, payments and other carrying costs of such Seller Guarantee
attributable to or for periods after the Closing Date, within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of invoices therefor. In the event that after the
Closing Date any Seller or an Affiliate is required to  



 

-99-  reimburse a letter of credit issuer for any drawing under a Seller
Guarantee, or is required to make any payment under a Seller Guarantee (other
than carrying costs as provided above), then the Buyer shall reimburse such
Seller or Affiliate within five (5) Business Days after demand for the payment
of such amount.

all of the obligations and liabilities relating to the assets or Stock
transferred to such designee hereunder.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but both of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

11.9 _Governing Law_. Subject to the provisions of certain Exhibits hereto
regarding the application of local law, this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule

the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of
New York.



 

-103- 11.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. The Parties may mutually amend or waive any
provision of this Agreement at any time. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by either Party of any default,

affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent

11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.



11.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary
in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. 



11.13 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not  



 

-104-  performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party may be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States
or any state or jurisdiction thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and
the matter.



11.14 _Dispute Resolution_.



(a) _Dispute Notice_. If there is a dispute between the Parties arising out
of or related to this Agreement (except for matters to be resolved under
Section 1.4), Buyer or the Sellers (for purposes of this Section 11.14, each
being a " _Dispute Resolution Party_ ") may invoke the procedures specified
in this Section 11.14 by written notice. The written notice must:



(i) describe briefly the nature of the dispute;



(ii) the approximate amount of any monetary claim; and



(iii) designate an individual with authority to settle the dispute on behalf
of that Party.



The Dispute Resolution Party receiving the notice has 10 days within which to
designate an individual with authority to settle the dispute on its behalf
and to notify the other Dispute Resolution Party of its designation (the
individuals so designated are the " _Authorized Individuals_ ").



(b) _Dispute Resolution_. The Dispute Resolution Parties shall cause the
Authorized Individuals to begin discussions concerning resolution of the
dispute no later than 30 days from the date of the original notice invoking
these procedures. If the dispute has not been resolved within 60 days from the
date of the original notice invoking these procedures, the  



 

-105-  Dispute Resolution Parties shall submit the matter to alternative dispute
resolution (" _ADR_ ") in accordance with the following mini-trial procedure.



(c) _Neutral_. The Dispute Resolution Parties shall attempt to agree upon a
mutually acceptable person not then or previously affiliated in any manner
with either Dispute Resolution Party (" _Neutral_ ") within 10 days after the
expiration of the periods referred to in Section 11.14(b) or the earlier
agreement of the Dispute Resolution Parties to submit the matter to ADR. If a
Neutral is not selected within that time period, either Dispute Resolution
Party may request the Center for Public Resources, or if the Authorized
Representative has previously objected to the use of the Center for Public
Resources, the American Arbitration Association, to supply within ten (10)
days a list of at least three (3) potential Neutrals with qualifications as
specified in the request, or as agreed to jointly by the Parties. Within 7
days of receipt of the list, the Dispute Resolution Parties shall rank the
proposed candidates independently, exchange rankings (ranked numerically with
1 being the most desired) and select as the Neutral the individual who
receives the highest combined ranking who is available to serve. If two or
more individuals have the highest ranking and the Dispute Resolution Parties
do not agree within 5 days as to whom to select the organization that
provided the list of individuals may select the Neutral from among those
individuals with the highest ranking.



(d) _Pre-hearing Conference_. Within 30 days after appointment of the Neutral,
the Dispute Resolution Parties shall meet with the Neutral for a pre-hearing
conference. At the conference, the Dispute Resolution Parties shall arrange
for the exchange of information in the possession of the other Dispute
Resolution Party, including certain limited depositions where appropriate, and
the stipulation of uncontested facts. The Dispute Resolution Parties shall
establish the extent of and schedule for the production of relevant documents,
sworn depositions  



 

-106-  and the identification of witnesses. Should a dispute arise over the extent
of document production, appropriate witnesses or the scheduling of any
activity, including the hearing location and date, the Neutral is authorized
to make a final determination after hearing each Dispute Resolution Partys
position. At the pre-hearing conference, or at a later scheduled conference as
agreed to by both Dispute Resolution Parties, the location and date for the
hearing will be set which will not, unless both Dispute Resolution Parties
agree, be more than one 120 days from the date of the initial pre-hearing
conference.



(e) _Summary of Views_. One week before the scheduled hearing, each Dispute
Resolution Party shall deliver to the Neutral and to the other Dispute
Resolution Party a written summary of its views on the matter in dispute. The
summary may be no longer than twenty double-spaced pages unless the Dispute
Resolution Parties agree otherwise.



(f) _Hearing_. At the hearing each Dispute Resolution Party shall be
represented by the Authorized Individuals and also may be represented by
counsel. Each Dispute Resolution Party will have an agreed-upon time, not to
exceed four hours, in order to present its case. The Authorized Individuals
must be present for the presentations but may not participate in them. The
Neutral may ask questions during the presentations and the Authorized
Individuals may ask questions after the conclusion of the other
Dispute Resolution Partys presentation. At the conclusion of the
presentations, the Authorized Individuals, without counsel, will meet with the
Neutral to discuss the dispute in order to attempt to reach a resolution. If
no settlement is reached, the Neutral will orally summarize the dispute, the
strengths and weaknesses of both Dispute Resolution Parties positions and
give his or her opinion as to how much the Dispute Resolution Party seeking
recovery or other relief would  



 

-107-  receive if the matter were resolved through litigation. No stenographic,
visual or audio record made will be made of the hearing.



(g) _Participation_. The Dispute Resolution Parties shall participate in the
ADR to its conclusion as designated by the Neutral and not terminate
negotiations concerning resolution of the matters in dispute until at least 2
weeks after the hearing. Neither Dispute Resolution Party may begin a lawsuit
or seek other remedies prior to the conclusion of the two-week post-hearing
negotiation period. But, despite anything to the contrary in this Article or
elsewhere in this Agreement, either Dispute Resolution Party may commence
litigation on any date after which the commencement of litigation would be
barred by an applicable statute of limitations or in order to request
equitable relief. In that event, the Dispute Resolution Parties shall (except
as prohibited by court order) continue to participate in the ADR to its
conclusion.



(h) _Costs of Dispute Resolution_. The Dispute Resolution Parties shall share
equally the fees of, and reasonable costs incurred by, the Neutral. The
Neutral may not be a witness, consultant, expert or counsel for any Dispute
Resolution Party with respect to the matters in dispute and any related
matters.



(i) _Confidentiality_. The ADR is a compromise negotiation for purposes of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence. The entire
procedure is confidential. All conduct, statements, promises, offers, views
and opinions, whether oral or written, made in the course of the ADR by any
of the Dispute Resolution Parties, their agents, employees, representatives or
other invitees to the ADR and by the Neutral, who is the Dispute Resolution
Parties joint agent for purposes of these compromise negotiations,
are confidential and will, in addition and where appropriate, be deemed to be
work product and privileged. The conduct, statements, promises, offers, views
and opinions are not discoverable or admissible for any  



 

-108-  purposes, except impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding
involving the Dispute Resolution Parties and may not be disclosed to anyone
not an agent, employee, expert, witness, or representative for any of the
Dispute Resolution Parties. Evidence otherwise discoverable or admissible is
not excluded from discovery or admission as a result of its use in the ADR and
the Dispute Resolution Parties may request any discovery to which they would
otherwise be entitled without regard to the documents, depositions or other
discovery that occurred as part of the ADR.



(j) _Exclusive Means for Dispute Resolution_.



(i) A Partys failure or refusal to participate in the dispute resolution
mechanisms of this Article is a material breach of this Agreement. If any
Party seeks and secures judicial intervention requiring enforcement of this
Section 11.14, it will be entitled to recover from the other Party in the
judicial proceeding all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that it was required to incur.



(k) Except for the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 1.4, the
procedures specified in this Section 11.14 are the sole and exclusive
procedures for the resolution of disputes between the Parties arising out of
or relating to this Agreement.



(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
shall have the right to pursue provisional relief from any court, such as
attachment, specific performance, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to
avoid irreparable harm, even though ADR has not been commenced or completed.
For purposes of any action described in this Section 11.14(l), each Party (i)
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in the
Southern District of New York, or any state court in the Bureau of Manhattan,
State of New York, (ii) agrees that any action described in this Section
11.14(l) may be heard and determined  



 

-109-  only in such court, (iii) agrees not to bring any such action in any other
court, and (iv) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action described in this Section 11.14(l) and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of the other Party with respect
thereto.



11.15 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Asset Sellers will not
comply with the provisions of the bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



11.16 _Construction_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (i)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (ii) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(iii) "date hereof" refers to the date set forth in the initial caption of
this Agreement; (iv) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree
to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean
simply "if"; (v) definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms; (vi) references to a
contract or agreement mean such contract or agreement as amended or otherwise
modified from time to time; (vii) references to a person or entity are also
to its permitted successors and assigns; (viii) references to an "Article",
"Section", "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refer to an Article or Section of, or an
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement; (ix) references to "$" or otherwise
to dollar amounts refer to the lawful currency of the United States; and (x)
references to a law include any rules, regulations and delegated legislation
issued thereunder. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the  



 

-110-  language chosen by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against either Party.

 



11.17 _Foreign Exchange Conversions_. If any amount to be paid, transferred,
allocated, indemnified, reimbursed or calculated pursuant to, or in accordance
with, the terms of this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule (including the
Disclosure Schedule) referred to herein (including the calculation, payment
or reimbursement of Damages under Article VI or Article VIII hereof) is
originally stated or expressed in a currency other than United States Dollars,
then, for the purpose of determining the amount to be so paid, transferred,
allocated, indemnified, reimbursed or calculated, such amount shall be
converted into United States Dollars at the exchange rate between those two
currencies most recently quoted in The Wall Street Journal in New York as of
the Business Day immediately prior to (or, if no such quote exists on such
Business Day, on the closest Business Day prior to) the day on which the party
required to make such payment, transfer, indemnification, reimbursement or
calculation first becomes obligated to do so hereunder (or, in the case of
Article VI or Article VIII hereof, would have first become obligated to do so
but for the operation of Section 6.5(b) hereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 11.17 shall be deemed to require any party to
make any foreign currency conversion or other similar calculation that
violates or conflicts with, or otherwise causes a party to violate, applicable
law or U.S. GAAP.



11.18 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or the actions of either Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement.



 

-111- 11.19 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits, Schedules and
Disclosure Schedule identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.
