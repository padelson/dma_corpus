Valuation Spreadsheet, divided by (B) the Average Acquiror Stock Price.  
"TREASURY STOCK BASIS" means a calculation method which assumes that options

of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall equal the General
Cash Conversion Number.   8    "UNVESTED COMPANY OPTIONS" means any

Fully-Diluted Unvested Company Options is based on mutual assumptions of the
Company and Acquiror as to the amount of Merger consideration that would be
forfeited by Continuing Employees whose employment or service is terminated
within six months following the Effective Time. The parties intend that the
calculations set forth in the Valuation Spreadsheet will result in the
Company Securityholders receiving (inclusive of their contributions to the
Escrow Cash) no more and no less than the Total Merger Consideration (valued
in cash or with respect to Acquiror Options, the excess of the Average
Acquiror Stock Price over exercise price) after taking into effect such
forfeitures.   Other capitalized terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement
and not defined in this Article 1 shall have the meanings assigned to such
terms in this Agreement.   ARTICLE 2  THE MERGER   2.1 Conversion of
Shares.   (a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, no par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of the Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock are so converted
shall be the only shares of Common Stock of the Company that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.   (b) Conversion of
Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants.   (i) Company
Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder
thereof (except as expressly provided herein), be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest,  
9   equal to the General Cash Conversion Number. The amount of cash each
Company Shareholder is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Capital
Stock held by such Company Shareholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent
and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Capital
Stock held by such Company Shareholder. The preceding provisions of this
Section 2.1(b)(i) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(c) (regarding
rights of holders of Dissenting Shares), Section 2.1(e) (regarding the
continuation of vesting and repurchase rights) and Section 2.3 (regarding the
withholding of Escrow Cash).   (ii) Vested Company Options. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company
Option (other than an Unvested Company Option) that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof
(except as expressly provided herein), be converted into and represent the
right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option multiplied by (B) (the General Cash Conversion Number, less the
exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option); provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from such payment made to the holder of a Company Option
the amount of withholding for taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.1(b)(ii). The
amount of cash each Company Optionholder is entitled to receive for the
Company Options (other than Unvested Company Options) held by such Company
Optionholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for Company Options held by such
Company Optionholder. The preceding provisions of this Section 2.1(b)(ii) are
subject to the provisions of Section 2.3 (regarding the withholding of Escrow
Cash).   (iii) Company Warrants. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the
holder thereof (except as expressly provided herein), be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject to
such Company Warrant multiplied by (B) (the General Cash Conversion Number,
less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Warrant). The
amount of cash each Company Warrantholder is entitled to receive for the
Company Warrants held by such Company Shareholder shall be rounded to the
nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Company
Warrants held by such Company Warrantholder.   (iv) Unvested Company
Options. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof
(except as expressly provided herein), be assumed by Acquiror and converted
into an Acquiror Option, and each holder of an assumed Unvested Company
Option shall be entitled, in accordance with the terms of such Acquiror
Option, to purchase after the Effective Time that number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock, determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the   10   General Stock Conversion
Number, and the exercise price per share for each such Acquiror Option will
equal the exercise price of the Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by the General Stock Conversion Number, such
exercise price being rounded up to the nearest whole cent. If the foregoing
calculation results in an assumed Unvested Company Option being exercisable
for a fraction of a share, then the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
subject to such Acquiror Option will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number with no cash being payable for such fractional share. In no
event shall the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, exercise price or
any other term or provision of any Acquiror Option issued pursuant to this
Section 2.1(b)(iv) be adjusted or modified in any manner as a result of any
of the provisions of Section 2.1(b)(v). The term, exercisability, vesting
schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code, if applicable, and all other material terms of the Unvested Company
Option will otherwise be unchanged; provided, however, that the Acquiror
Option shall not be exercisable for shares of Acquiror Common Stock which are
not then vested according to such vesting schedule. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Acquiror will notify in writing each holder of an Unvested
Company Option of the assumption of such Unvested Company Option by Acquiror,
and the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that are then subject to
such option and the exercise price of such option, as determined pursuant to
this Section 2.1(b)(iv), and each Company Optionholder shall, as a condition
to receipt of an Acquiror Option pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(iv),
countersign such notice and agree to the treatment of such Person\'s Company
Options in the manner set forth in Sections 2.1(b)(ii) and (iv). Acquiror
will cause the Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed
Unvested Company Options to be registered on Form S-8 of the SEC within 10
business days after the Effective Time (assuming timely receipt of the
Spreadsheet, all option documentation relating to the Unvested Company
Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
all signatures, opinions and consents required for such registration
statement), will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed
Unvested Company Options remain outstanding and will reserve a sufficient
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for issuance upon exercise thereof.
The Form S-8 shall not cover the shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to
any Unvested Company Options which are held by persons who do not become
employees of the Acquiror at the Effective Time or do not otherwise have a
service relationship with the Acquiror at the Effective Time.   (v)
Adjustment.   (1) Following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall calculate
(a) the aggregate amount of cash payable to Company Securityholders pursuant
to Section 2.1(b)(i)-(iii) (prior to any deduction of any tax withholding and
withholding of Escrow Cash) and (b) for each Acquiror Option, the number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to each Acquiror Option multiplied by
the difference between the Average Acquiror Stock Price and the exercise
price of such Acquiror Option (the aggregate of the amounts specified in the
foregoing clauses (a)-(b) being "CLOSING MERGER CONSIDERATION VALUE").   (2)
If, on or prior to the six month anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Continuing Employee who has had Unvested Cash withheld on his or her behalf
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) or an Acquiror Option issued pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)(iv) shall have his or her employment or service relationship
with Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation   11   terminated for any
reason (including a voluntary departure) and Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation exercises its right of repurchase with respect to such Unvested
Cash or such Continuing Employee otherwise forfeits such Unvested Cash or any
unvested portion of such Acquiror Option, then Acquiror shall calculate (a)
the dollar amount of such repurchased or forfeited Unvested Cash
(calculated net of payment of any repurchase price for such Unvested Cash)
and (b) for each Acquiror Option held by such Continuing Employee, the number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to the unvested portion of such
Acquiror Option forfeited by such person upon termination multiplied by the
difference between the Average Acquiror Stock Price and the exercise price of
such Acquiror Option (the aggregate of the amounts specified in the foregoing
clauses (a)-(b) for all such Continuing Employees being the "FORFEITED MERGER
CONSIDERATION VALUE"). The amount obtained by subtracting the Forfeited
Merger Consideration Value from the Closing Merger Consideration Value shall
be the "ADJUSTED MERGER CONSIDERATION VALUE". If the Adjusted Merger
Consideration Value is less than the Total Merger Consideration, then the
difference between the two (expressed as a positive number) shall be the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION UNDERPAYMENT". If the Adjusted Merger Consideration
Value is greater than the Total Merger Consideration, then the difference
between the two (expressed as a positive number) shall be the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION OVERPAYMENT".   (3) As soon as reasonably practicable
(but in no event more than five business days) following the six-month
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall prepare and deliver to
the Representative a statement (the "ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT STATEMENT") setting
forth the Acquiror\'s calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration Value,
Forfeited Merger Consideration Value, Adjusted Merger Consideration Value,
Merger Consideration Underpayment (if any) and Merger Consideration
Overpayment (if any). The Adjustment Amount Statement shall be final and
binding on the Representative, the Effective Time Holders and the Acquiror
unless the Representative shall notify the Acquiror in writing (a "NOTICE OF
DISPUTE"), within ten business days of its receipt of the Adjustment Amount
Statement, that the Representative wishes to dispute one or more items set
forth in the Adjustment Amount Statement (a "DISPUTED ITEM"), which Notice of
Dispute shall set out in reasonable detail each Disputed Item, the basis for
such dispute, the amount in dispute and the Representative\'s calculation of
the Closing Merger Consideration Value, Forfeited Merger Consideration Value,
Adjusted Merger Consideration Value, Merger Consideration Underpayment (if
any) and Merger Consideration Overpayment (if any). In the event that the
Representative shall fail to notify the Acquiror of any dispute with respect
to any items set forth in the Adjustment Amount Statement within such ten
business day period, (i) the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted
and approved the Adjustment Amount Statement (or any items with respect to
which the Representative has not so notified the Acquiror of a dispute), and
(ii) the Adjustment Amount Statement shall be deemed to be final and binding
on the Representative, the Effective Time Holders and the Acquiror with
respect to any item set forth in the Adjustment Amount Statement that is not
a Disputed Item. The Acquiror shall permit the Representative and its
accountants and other advisors reasonable access during normal
business hours, and on reasonable notice, to any relevant accounts, documents
and records within its possession which are reasonably necessary for the
purposes of reviewing the Adjustment Amount Statement, and will permit them
to make copies of such accounts, documents and records at their own cost and
expense. If the Representative shall notify the Acquiror of one or more
Disputed Items in accordance with this Section 2.1(b)(v)(3), the
Representative and the Acquiror shall consult with each other and attempt in
good faith to resolve any and all Disputed   12   Items. If the
Representative and the Acquiror are unable to resolve any Disputed Items
within 30 calendar days of the delivery of a Notice of Dispute, such Dispute
Items shall be referred, on the application of either the Representative or
the Acquiror, for determination by a nationally recognized,
independent auditing firm that is mutually acceptable to the Representative
and the Acquiror (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM"). The following terms shall apply to
any such determination:   a. each of the Representative and the
Acquiror shall promptly prepare a written statement on the Disputed Items
which (together with the relevant documents) will be submitted to Accounting
Firm for determination;   b. in giving its determination, the
Accounting Firm shall state what adjustments (if any) are necessary to the
Adjustment Amount Statement in respect of the Disputed Items in order to
comply with the requirements of this Agreement;   c. the Accounting Firm
shall act as an expert (and not as an arbitrator) in making any determination
with respect to any Disputed Items, which shall be final and binding on the
Representative, the Effective Time Holders and the Acquiror; and   d. the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid (i) by the Effective
Time Holders, if the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value calculated based
upon any determinations of the Accounting Firm and the Representative\'s
calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value is greater than the
difference between the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value calculated based
upon any determinations of the Accounting Firm and the Acquiror\'s
calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value, (ii) by the Acquiror,
if the difference between the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value calculated
based upon any determinations of the Accounting Firm and the Acquiror\'s
calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value is greater than the
difference between the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value calculated based
upon any determinations of the Accounting Firm and the
Representative\'s calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value, and
(iii) by the Representative and the Acquiror equally if the difference
between the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value calculated based upon any
determinations of the Accounting Firm and Representative\'s calculation of
the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value is equal to the difference between
the Adjusted Merger Consideration Value calculated based upon any
determinations of the Accounting Firm and Acquiror\'s calculation of the
Adjusted Merger Consideration Value.  If the Representative and the Acquiror
reach (or pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(v)(3) hereof are deemed to reach)
agreement on the Adjustment Amount Statement, or the Adjustment Amount
Statement is finally determined at any stage in the procedures set out in
this Section 2.1(b)(v)(3), the Adjustment Amount Statement as so agreed or
determined (including the values for the Closing Merger Consideration Value,
Forfeited Merger Consideration Value, Adjusted Merger Consideration Value,
Merger Consideration Underpayment (if any) and Merger Consideration
Overpayment (if any) set forth therein) shall be final and binding on the
Representative, Effective Time Holders and the Acquiror and shall be deemed
to be the "FINAL ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT STATEMENT," for all purposes of and under
this Agreement.   13    (4) If the Final Adjustment Amount Statement
indicates a Merger Consideration Underpayment, then within five business days
after determination of the Final Adjustment Amount Statement, Acquiror shall
make available to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 7.2(b)) cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration Underpayment and direct the
Exchange Agent to pay to each Tendering Company Holder (as defined in Section
7.2(b)) an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest cent), without interest,
equal to its Pro Rata Share (as defined in Section 2.3) of such Merger
Consideration Underpayment. The amount of cash each Tendering Company Holder
is entitled to receive shall be (a) subject to deduction and withholding for
the amount of withholding for taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.1(b)(v), (b)
subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(e) (regarding the continuation of
vesting and repurchase rights), and (c) treated as payment of an additional
consideration in the Merger for the Company Capital Stock, Company Options
(other than Unvested Company Options) and Company Warrants tendered by such
holder.   (5) If the Final Adjustment Amount Statement indicates a Merger
Consideration Overpayment, then (a) the amount of the Merger Consideration
Overpayment shall constitute "Damages" for purposes of Section 11 without
regard to the Deductible (as defined in Section 11.3) and (b) Acquiror shall
be entitled to recover the amount of the Merger Consideration
Overpayment from the Escrow Cash and neither the Representative nor any
Effective Time Holder shall have any power or authority to object under any
provision of Article 11 to the amount of any such claim by or on behalf of
Acquiror against the Escrow Cash.   (c) Dissenting Shares. As more fully
set forth in Section 7.3, holders of shares of Company Capital Stock who have
complied with all requirements for perfecting dissenters\' rights, as set
forth in California Law, shall be entitled to their rights under California
Law with respect to such shares.   (d) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b), each share of Company Capital Stock held by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.   (e) Continuation of Vesting and Repurchase Rights. If there
are any Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, then the right to recover or extinguish such Unvested
Company Shares under the terms of any Contract with the Company shall be
assigned to Acquiror and the cash payable upon conversion of such Unvested
Company Shares in the Merger (the "UNVESTED CASH") shall be, in place of such
Unvested Company Shares, equally subject to such right assigned to Acquiror
and shall be withheld by Acquiror and paid without interest to the holders of
such Unvested Company Shares if and to the extent such assigned right expires
unexercised by Acquiror pursuant to the terms of the applicable Contract with
the Company; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such payments the amount of
withholding imposed for taxes; provided further, that a portion of such newly
vested cash so distributed may be treated as imputed interest and will be so
treated to the extent required under the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any   14   such holder
paid for Unvested Company Shares with promissory notes, Unvested Cash which
vests shall first be applied towards repayment of accrued interest and then
outstanding principal under such promissory notes before being distributed to
such holder. The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror (or its assignee) is
entitled to exercise any such right assigned hereunder, such that any
Unvested Cash shall be returned to the Acquiror without payment to
such holder (other than payment of the original purchase price of any
Unvested Company Shares converted into Unvested Cash upon exercise of the
applicable right by Acquiror according to the terms of the Contract with the
Company governing such Unvested Company Shares as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time). No Unvested Cash, or right thereto, may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law), by any Person, other than Acquiror, or be taken or reached
by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other
liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such
Unvested Cash in accordance with this Agreement.   2.2 Company Options,
Company Warrants and Other Rights Not Assumed. Acquiror is not assuming, and
shall not assume, any obligations or Liabilities under (a) the Company Option
Plan, (b) any outstanding Company Options (other than Unvested Company
Options), (c) any outstanding Company Warrants, or (d) any other direct or
indirect rights to acquire shares of Company Capital Stock. On the Closing
Date, the Company Plan, the Company Options (other than Unvested Company
Options), the Company Warrants and any other direct or indirect rights to
acquire shares of Company Capital Stock shall be terminated without
further obligation or Liability of the Company, Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation (other than to make the cash payments contemplated by Section
2.1(b)). Acquiror shall not substitute any equivalent option, warrant or
right for any such terminated Company Option, Company Warrant or right.  
2.3 Escrow. At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall withhold the Escrow Cash
from the cash payable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) to the Company Shareholders
and Company Optionholders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than holders of solely shares of Company Capital Stock
which constitute and remain Dissenting Shares and holders of solely Unvested
Company Options) ("EFFECTIVE TIME HOLDERS"), on a pro rata basis (based upon
the amount of cash each such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) with respect to its Company Capital Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares) and Company Options relative to the amount of cash all
such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) with respect
to their Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) and Company
Options) ("PRO RATA SHARE"). Prior to the Closing, Acquiror, the
Representative and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "ESCROW AGENT") shall enter
into an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
D (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"). Within three business days after the Spreadsheet
Submission Date, Acquiror shall cause the Escrow Cash to be deposited with
the Escrow Agent. If a Company Securityholder holds Unvested Company Shares,
then the cash to be paid upon conversion hereunder of shares of Company
Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants held by such
Company Securityholder which are not Unvested Company Shares (the "VESTED
CASH") shall be withheld and placed in escrow first and, thereafter, the
Unvested Cash shall be withheld and placed in escrow (with the understanding
that any Unvested Cash so placed in escrow shall vest prior to any such
Unvested Cash not placed in escrow but withheld by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 2.1(e)) to the extent necessary to satisfy such Effective Time
Holders\' escrow obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 2.4. The payment of   15   any Escrow Cash in satisfaction of any
indemnification obligations under Article 11 shall be made, with respect to
each Effective Time Holder, first with Vested Cash and then, if such cash is
insufficient to satisfy such indemnification obligation and only to the
extent of such insufficiency, shall such payment be made with Unvested Cash.
The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Cash as the sole and exclusive
security for the Effective Time Holders\' indemnification obligations for
Damages under Article 11.   2.4 Effects of the Merger. At and upon the
Effective Time:   (a) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the Agreement of Merger;   (b) the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to read as set
forth in the Agreement of Merger;   (c) the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to read as the Bylaws of
Merger Sub;   (d) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be appointed as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time until their respective
successors are duly appointed;   (e) the members of the Board of Directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be appointed as
the members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified; and   (f) the Merger shall, from
and after the Effective Time, have all of the effects provided by California
Law.   2.5 Tax Consequences and Withholding.   (a) The parties intend that
the Merger shall be treated as a taxable purchase of securities of the
Company pursuant to the Code. However, Acquiror makes no representations or
warranties to the Company or to any Company Shareholder, Company Optionholder
or Company Warrantholder regarding (a) the tax treatment of the Merger or (b)
any of the tax consequences to the Company or any Company Shareholder,
Company Optionholder or Company Warrantholder of this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The
Company and, by virtue of the Company Shareholders approving the Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby, the
Company Shareholders acknowledge that the Company and the Company
Shareholders are relying solely on their own tax advisors in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions or agreements
contemplated hereby.   (b) Acquiror or Acquiror\'s agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Total Merger Consideration or other payment
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Shareholder,
Company Optionholder or Company Warrantholder, the amounts  
16   required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Company Shareholder, Company Optionholder or Company Warrantholder in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.   2.6 Further
Assurances. If, at any time before or after the Effective Time, Acquiror
reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate
the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or
after the Effective Time, then the Company, Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.   ARTICLE 3  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Company Ancillary
Agreements by the Company, nor the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, conflicts with, or (with or

Subsidiary or any of their respective assets or properties; or (c)

is no action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or
investigation pending against the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or
against any officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in their capacity as such or relating to their employment,
services or relationship with the Company or such Company Subsidiary) before
any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator, nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, has any such action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding,
claim or investigation before any Governmental Authority been threatened. As
of the date hereof, there is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator outstanding against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or
investigation pending against any Governmental Authority or other Person. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no current basis for any indemnity
claim under Section 6.5(a).   3.7 Taxes. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary (and any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for
tax purposes of which the Company or any Subsidiary is or has been a member),
(a) has properly completed and timely filed all foreign, federal, state,  
21   local and municipal tax and information returns (the "RETURNS")
required to be filed by it, (b) has timely paid all taxes required to be paid
by it for which payment was due, (c) has established an adequate accrual or
reserve in accordance with GAAP for the payment of all unpaid taxes incurred
in respect of the periods or portions thereof prior to the Balance Sheet Date
(which accrual or reserve as of the Balance Sheet Date is fully reflected on
the Company Balance Sheet), (d) has made all necessary estimated tax
payments, and (e) has no Liability (fixed or contingent) for taxes in excess
of the amount so paid or accruals or reserves so established except for taxes
subsequent to the Balance Sheet Date incurred in the ordinary course of
business. All such Returns are true, correct and complete, and the Company
has provided or made available to Acquiror or its counsel true and correct
copies of such Returns. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
delinquent in the payment of any tax or in the filing of any Returns, and no
deficiencies for any tax have been threatened, claimed, proposed or assessed
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received any notification from the Internal Revenue
Service or any other taxing authority regarding any material issues that (a)
are currently pending before the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
agency or authority (including any sales or use taxing authority) regarding
the Company, or (b) have been raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other
taxing agency or authority and not yet finally resolved. No Return of the
Company or any Subsidiary is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service or
any other taxing agency or authority and any such past audits (if any) have
been completed and fully resolved to the satisfaction of the applicable
taxing agency or authority conducting such audit and all taxes determined by
such audit to be due from the Company or any Subsidiary have been paid in
full to the applicable taxing agencies or authorities. No tax liens
are currently in effect against any of the assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary other than liens that arise by operation of law for taxes not yet

Company Subsidiary of any statute of limitations with respect to any taxes.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has consented to extend to a
date later than the Agreement Date the period in which any tax may be
assessed or collected by any taxing agency or authority. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary have complied (and until the Closing Date will comply)

(including withholding of taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and
1446 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign law), have, within
the time and in the manner prescribed by law, withheld from employee wages
and paid over to the proper taxing agencies and authorities all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under all Applicable Law (including
Federal Insurance Contribution Act, Medicare and relevant state income and
employment tax withholding laws), and have timely filed all withholding tax
Returns. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
bound by any tax sharing, tax indemnity, or tax allocation agreement nor does
the Company or any Company Subsidiary have any liability or potential
liability to another party under any such agreement. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has filed any disclosures under Section 6662 of the
Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law to prevent the
imposition of penalties with respect to any tax reporting position taken on
any Return. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has consummated,
has participated in, or is currently participating in any transaction which
was or is a "tax shelter" transaction as defined in Sections 6662, 6011, 6012
or 6111 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has ever been a member of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which the Company was
not the ultimate parent   22   corporation. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any liability for the taxes of any Person (other than
the Company or any Company Subsidiary) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury
Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, nor any "dual resident corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 1503(d) of the Code) in which either the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is considered to hold an interest, has incurred a dual
consolidated loss within the meaning of Section 1503 of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been or will be required to include
any material adjustment in taxable income for any tax period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 481 of the Code or
any comparable provision under state or foreign tax laws as a result of
transactions, events or accounting methods employed prior to the
Merger. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a "personal holding
company" within the meaning of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has ever been a "United States real property holding corporation"
within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code, and the Company and each
Company Subsidiary has filed with the Internal Revenue Service all
statements, if any, which are required under Section 1.897-2(h) of the
Treasury Regulations. There is currently no limitation on the utilization of
net operating losses, capital losses, built-in losses, tax credits or similar
items of the Company under Sections 269, 382, 383, 384 or 1502 of the Code
(and any comparable provisions of foreign, state, local or municipal law).
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (a) in
the two years prior to the Agreement Date or (b) in a distribution that could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"

the Company or any Company Subsidiary or used in the Company Business are in

party are in full force and effect and afford the Company or such  
23   Company Subsidiary valid leasehold possession of the real or personal
property that is the subject of the lease without material disruption (except
as provided under such leases and Applicable Laws). Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary owns any real property.   3.10 Absence of Certain

forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a right of forfeiture
or termination of, any material Company IP Right; or (iii) materially impair
the right of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any Company

product) as a result of the use, license-in, manufacture, sale, offering for
sale, copying, distribution, or disposition of any Company IP Rights by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and none shall become payable as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Except with respect to Contracts to which Acquiror or Surviving Corporation

of the Company\'s software product (each a "COMPANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE").
Neither the use, development, manufacture, marketing, licensing, sale,
offering for sale, or distribution of any Company Product or Service as
currently licensed, utilized, developed, manufactured, marketed, sold,
offered for sale, distributed or provided by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (i) violates any license or other Contract between the  
29   Company or such Company Subsidiary and any third party, or (ii)
infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property of any other party.
Neither the use, development, manufacture, licensing, sale, offering for
sale, distribution, or intended use of the next version of the Company\'s
software product identified in Schedule 3.13(c) (i) violates any Contract
between Company or such Subsidiary and any third party, or (ii) infringes or
misappropriates, or will infringe or misappropriate, any Intellectual
Property of any other party. As of the date hereof, there is no pending, or
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, claim or litigation contesting
the validity, ownership or right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
exercise any Company IP Right, nor has the Company or any Company Subsidiary
as of the date hereof received any notice asserting that any Company IP Right
or the proposed use, development, manufacture, sale, offering for sale,
licensing, or distribution thereof infringes or shall infringe the
Intellectual Property of any other party, and as of the date hereof neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice from
any third party offering a license under any such third party patents. Except
for knowledge acquired based on a claim, litigation, notice or offer
to license of the type described in the preceding sentence after the date
hereof ("IP NOTICE", as to which no representation is made), to the knowledge
of the Company, there is no legitimate basis for any claim or assertion that
the proposed use, development, manufacture, sale, offering for sale,
licensing, or distribution of Company-Owned IP infringes or shall infringe
the Intellectual Property of any other party. As of the date hereof, none of
the Company-Owned IP Rights, the Company Products or Services, the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any proceeding or outstanding
order, contract or stipulation (i) restricting in any manner the use,
distribution, transfer, or licensing by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries of any Company-Owned IP Rights, or any Company Product or
Service, or which may affect the validity, use or enforceability of any such
Company-Owned IP Rights, Company-Licensed IP Rights or Company Product or
Service, or (ii) restricting the conduct of the Company Business because of
an infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property rights of a
third party.   (d) To the knowledge of the Company, no current or
former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary: (i) is in material violation of any term or covenant of
any employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, invention
assignment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement or
any other Contract with any other party by virtue of such employee\'s,
consultant\'s or independent contractor\'s being employed by, or performing
services for, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or using trade secrets or
proprietary information of others without permission; or (ii) has developed
any technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work for the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is subject to
any Contract under which such employee, consultant or independent contractor
has assigned or otherwise granted to any third party any rights (including
Intellectual Property) in or to such technology, software or other
copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work. Neither the
employment of any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor the
use by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the services of any
consultant or independent contractor subjects the Company or such Company
Subsidiary to any Liability to any third party for improperly soliciting such
employee, consultant or independent contractor to work for the Company or
such Company Subsidiary, whether such Liability is based on contractual or
other legal obligations to such third party.   30    (e) The Company and
each Company Subsidiary has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect,
preserve and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the Company IP
Rights that it desires to maintain as a trade secret and confidential. All
current and former officers, employees, consultants and independent
contractors of the Company and any Company Subsidiary having access to
proprietary information of the Company or such Company Subsidiary,
its customers or business partners and inventions owned by the Company or
such Company Subsidiary have executed and delivered to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary an agreement regarding the protection of such proprietary
information and the assignment of inventions to the Company or such Company
Subsidiary (in the case of proprietary information of the Company\'s or such
Company Subsidiary\'s customers and business partners, to the extent required
by such customers and business partners); and copies of all forms of such
agreements have been made available to Acquiror\'s legal counsel. Except to
the extent that such persons or entities may be a licensee under the
Company\'s standard form license agreement, no current or former employee,
officer, director, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has any right, license, claim or interest whatsoever in or
with respect to any Company-Owned IP Rights. Schedule 3.13(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all technology, software or
Intellectual Property owned by a third party that is incorporated into,
integrated or bundled with the Company Products or Services ("THIRD PARTY

of 2000 (a copy of which letter(s) have been made available to Acquiror and

other Governmental Authority, administrators, trustees, beneficiaries and
alternate payees relating to any Company Benefit Arrangement.   (v) As of
the date hereof, no suit, administrative proceeding, action or other
litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, is threatened against or with respect to any Company
Benefit Arrangement, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or the DOL.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has ever been a participant in
any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA with
respect to any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) that the Company or such Company Subsidiary sponsors as employer or in
which the Company or such Company Subsidiary participates as an
employer which was not otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 408 of ERISA
(including any individual exemption granted under Section 408(a) of ERISA) or
that could result in an excise tax under the Code or the assessment of a
civil penalty under Section 502(i) of ERISA.   (vi) All contributions due
from the Company with respect to the Company Benefit Arrangements have been
timely made under the terms of the applicable   36   Company Benefit
Arrangement, ERISA, the Code and any other Applicable Law, or there is a
period of time remaining for such contributions to be timely made . No
further contributions shall be due or shall have accrued thereunder as of
the Closing Date (other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practices, after the Balance Sheet Date as
a result of the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after

to accept such offer.   (viii) The Company shall not have any Liability to
any employee or to any organization or any other entity as a result of

No Company Benefit Arrangement (other than life insurance arrangements)
provides post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other Applicable Law.   (e)
There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Arrangement that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company
Benefit Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred in respect
thereof during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004.   (f) Each Company
Benefit Arrangement, to the extent applicable, is in compliance, in all
material respects, with the continuation coverage requirements of Section

Protection Act of 1996 (including any amendments to or
regulations promulgated under any of the foregoing acts), or any similar
provisions of state law, as such requirements affect the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their employees. There are no outstanding, uncorrected
violations under the Consolidation Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,
as amended ("COBRA"), with respect to any of the Company Benefit
Arrangements, covered employees or qualified beneficiaries that would be
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or Acquiror.   (g) No benefit payable or that may become

employment or compensation guarantee, or (C) providing severance benefits or

amount; provided further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
Acquiror may fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.5(b) by purchasing

officers\' insurance policy, in either case which (i) has an effective term
of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are
currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' insurance

pursuant to Section 2.1(b), subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(c)
(regarding rights of holders of Dissenting Shares), Section 2.1(e) (regarding

holders of Dissenting Shares), Section 2.1(e) (regarding the continuation of
vesting and repurchase rights) and Section 2.3 (regarding the withholding of

the Effective Time (and in any event no later than five business days after
the Effective Time), the Acquiror shall cause to be mailed to each holder of
record of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the certificates or
instruments evidencing such securities being "COMPANY CERTIFICATES") and
which were converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section
2.1(b) the following: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Acquiror and the Company may reasonably specify
and contain an agreement to be bound by the indemnification provisions

or its transfer agent of any Company Capital Stock, Company Options or
Company Warrants that were outstanding immediately prior to the  
55   Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Company Certificates
or Affidavits are presented for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 7.2.   (d) Until Company Certificates
are surrendered or an Affidavit is delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(b), such
Company Certificates shall be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership

Warrants shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), subject to the
provisions of Section 2.1(c) (regarding rights of holders of Dissenting
Shares), Section 2.1(e) (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase
rights) and Section 2.3 (regarding the withholding of the Escrow Cash).

Capital Stock are entitled to dissenters\' rights pursuant to California Law,
any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive cash as
provided in Section 2.1(b), but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to California Law. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of California Law, becomes entitled to
payment of the fair market value of such shares shall receive payment
therefor in accordance with California Law (but only after the value therefor
shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to California
Law). In the event that any Company Shareholder fails to make an effective
demand for payment or fails to perfect its dissenters\' rights as to its
shares of Company Capital Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose
their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be
converted into the right to receive the consideration issuable pursuant to
Article 2 in respect of such shares had such shares never been Dissenting
Shares, and Acquiror shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as
promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times
specified in Section 7.2, following the satisfaction of the applicable
conditions set forth in Section 7.2, the cash, without interest thereon, to
which such Company Shareholder would have been entitled under Section 2.1(b)
with respect to such shares, subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(e)
(regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights) and Section 2.3
(regarding the withholding of the Escrow Cash). The Company shall give
Acquiror prompt notice (and in no event more than two business days) of any
demand received by the Company for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or
notice of exercise of a Company Shareholder\'s dissenters\' rights, and
Acquiror shall have the right to control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demand. The Company agrees that, except with
Acquiror\'s prior written consent, it shall not voluntarily make any payment
or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for appraisal or exercise of dissenters\' rights.   ARTICLE

contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Either Acquiror or the Company, by
giving written notice to the other, may terminate this Agreement if the
Merger shall not have been consummated by midnight Pacific Time on August 15,
2004; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.2(b) shall not be available to any party whose breach of a
representation or warranty or covenant made under this Agreement by such
party results in the failure of any condition set forth in Article 8 or
Article 9 to be fulfilled or satisfied on or before such date.   (c) Either
Acquiror or the Company may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the
Effective Time if (i) the other has committed a breach of (1) any of its
representations and warranties under Article 3 or Article 4, as applicable,
or (2) any of its covenants under Article 5 or Article 6, as applicable, and
has not cured such breach within ten business days after the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement has given the other party written notice of the
material breach and its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.2(c) (provided, however, that no such cure period shall be
available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be
cured) and (ii) if not cured on or prior to the Closing Date, such
breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Article 9 or Article 8, as applicable, to be fulfilled or satisfied;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.2(c) shall not be available to a party if the party is at that
time in material breach of this Agreement.   (d) Acquiror, by giving
written notice to the Company, may terminate this Agreement if the Company
shall have failed to deliver an executed Company Shareholder Consent and an
executed Company Shareholder Letter from each Company Shareholder listed in
Exhibit B-1, which together constitute the Company Shareholder Approval, no
later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the date immediately following the
Agreement Date.   10.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 10.2, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers, directors,
shareholders or affiliates; provided, however, that (i) the provisions of
this Section 10.3 (Effect of Termination) and Article 12 (Miscellaneous)
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any   61   party hereto
from liability in connection with any material breach of any of such party\'s
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein.   ARTICLE 11 
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, INDEMNIFICATION  AND REMEDIES; CONTINUING
COVENANTS   11.1 Survival. If the Merger is consummated, the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and the other
agreements, certificates and documents contemplated hereby shall survive the
Effective Time and remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any of the parties to
this Agreement, until the one year anniversary of the Effective Time;
provided, however, that no right to indemnification pursuant to Article 11 in
respect of any claim based upon any failure of a representation or warranty
that is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered prior to the applicable
expiration date of such representation or warranty shall be affected by the
expiration of such representation or warranty; and provided, further, that
such expiration shall not affect the rights of Acquiror under Article 11 or
otherwise to seek recovery of Damages arising out of any fraud, willful
breach or intentional misrepresentation until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. If the Merger is consummated, the
representations and warranties of Acquiror contained in this Agreement and
the other agreements, certificates and documents contemplated hereby shall
expire and be of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time. If the
Merger is consummated, all covenants of the parties (including the covenants
set forth in Article 5 and Article 6) shall expire and be of no further force
or effect as of the Effective Time, except to the extent such covenants
provide that they are to be performed after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that no right to indemnification pursuant to Article 11 in respect
of any claim based upon any breach of a covenant shall be affected by the
expiration of such covenant.   11.2 Agreement to Indemnify. Each Effective
Time Holder shall severally (based on each such holder\'s Pro Rata Share),
and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror from and against any
and all Damages directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with: (a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or any Company
Ancillary Agreement to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date (as though such representation or warranty were
made as of the Closing Date, except in the case of representations and
warranties which by their terms speak only as of a specific date or dates);
(b) any failure of any certification, representation or warranty made by the
Company in any certificate delivered to Acquiror pursuant to Article 9 (other
than the Closing Financial Certificate) to be true and correct as of the date
such certificate is delivered to Acquiror; (c) any breach of or default in
connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or any Company Ancillary
Agreement; (d) any inaccuracies in the Spreadsheet or Closing Financial
Certificate; (e) any Indemnifiable Merger Expenses; or (f) any Dissenting
Shares Excess Payments. "DAMAGES" means losses, costs, damages, liabilities
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, other professionals\'
and experts fees, costs of investigation and court costs, and including
amounts that Acquiror properly pays to officers, directors or other agents of
Acquiror or the Company, but excluding special, consequential, incidental,
punitive or exemplary damages (except that such excluded damages shall not be
so excluded to the extent that Acquiror pays any such damages to   62   a
third party or records a liability or reserve on its financial statements
in accordance with GAAP for such payment). In determining the amount of any
Damages in respect of the failure of any representation or warranty to be
true and correct as of any particular date (but not in determining whether
any such representation and warranty is, in fact, true and correct), any
materiality qualifier contained in such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded.   11.3 Limitations.   (a) Nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the liability of the Company for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement if the Merger is not consummated.   (b) If
the Merger is consummated, the indemnification provisions set forth in
Section 11.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for
the matters listed in the foregoing clauses (a)-(f) of Section 11.2, except
in the case of fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation. The
Escrow Cash shall be the sole and exclusive security for Acquiror\'s
indemnification claims under this Article 11.   (c) If the Merger is
consummated, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Acquiror may not receive any Escrow Cash in respect of any claim for
indemnification that is made pursuant to clauses (a)-(b) of Section 11.2 that
does not involve fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation
unless and until Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $150,000 (the
"DEDUCTIBLE") have been incurred, paid or properly accrued, in which case
Acquiror may make claims for indemnification for only those Damages that
exceed the Deductible.   (d) If the Merger is consummated, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, in determining the amount of any
Damages, the amount of such Damages shall be calculated net of any insurance
proceeds (net of any collection costs incurred by Acquiror) and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Acquiror
from any third party with respect thereto (it being understood and hereby
agreed that the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to collect any available insurance proceeds and any indemnities,
contributions or other similar payments from third parties, but shall not be
required to commence litigation against any third parties). In the event that
Acquiror shall collect any available insurance proceeds and any indemnities,
contributions or other similar payments from third parties following its
receipt of any Escrow Cash in respect of a claim hereunder but prior to the
release of the Escrow Cash pursuant hereto, Acquiror shall redeposit into the
Escrow Cash account the amounts so collected from the Escrow Cash in an
amount equal to the amount of such proceeds or other payments used to reduce
the amount of Damages as set forth in the first sentence of
this paragraph.   11.4 Appointment of Representative.   (a) By voting in
favor of the Merger or participating in the conversion of Company Common
Stock and Company Options, each Effective Time Holder approves the
designation of and designates the Representative as the representative of the
Effective Time Holders and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on
behalf of each Effective Time Holder   63   solely with respect to claims
for indemnification under this Article 11, which shall include the right to:
(a) give and receive notices and communications to or from and/or the Escrow
Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the
extent that this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates
that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such
holders individually); (b) authorize the release or delivery to Acquiror
of the Escrow Cash in satisfaction of indemnification claims by Acquiror
pursuant to this Article 11 (including by not objecting to such claims); (c)
agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply with orders of courts with
respect to, indemnification claims by Acquiror pursuant to this Article 11;
and (d) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Representative
shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each Effective Time Holder
with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of all
indemnification claims under this Article 11 and all rights or obligations
arising under this Article 11. The Effective Time Holders shall be bound by
all actions taken and documents executed by the Representative in connection
with any indemnification claims under this Article 11, and Acquiror shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Representative. The
individual serving as the Representative may be replaced from time to time by
the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Cash then on deposit with
the Escrow Agent upon not less than ten days prior written notice to
Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the Representative, and the
Representative shall receive no compensation for his services. Notices or
communications to or from the Representative shall constitute notice to or
from each of the Effective Time Holders.   (b) In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Representative shall not be liable to any
Effective Time Holder in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Representative. Each Effective Time Holder
shall severally (based on each such holder\'s Pro Rata Share), and not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Representative from and against any
loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and
other legal costs reasonably incurred by the Representative. If not paid
directly to the Representative by the Effective Time Holders, such losses,
liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the Representative from Escrow
Cash otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders (and not
distributed or distributable to Acquiror or subject to a pending
indemnification claim of Acquiror) following the one year anniversary of the
Effective Time pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, at
the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Effective
Time Holders according to their respective Pro Rata Shares.   11.5 Notice
of Claim.   (a) As used herein, the term "CLAIM" means a claim
for indemnification of Acquiror under this Article 11. Subject to the terms
of Section 11.5(b) and (c), Acquiror shall give written notice of a Claim
executed by an officer of Acquiror (a "NOTICE OF CLAIM") to the
Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves
recovery against the Escrow Cash) promptly after Acquiror becomes aware of
the existence of any potential claim by Acquiror for indemnification from the
Effective Time Holders under this Article 11.   64    (b) Each Notice of
Claim by Acquiror given pursuant to Section 11.5 shall contain the following
information: (i) that Acquiror has directly or indirectly incurred, paid or
properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP) or, in good faith, believes it
shall have to directly or indirectly incur, pay or accrue (in accordance with
GAAP), Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim (which
amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an action
brought against the Acquiror based on alleged facts, which if true, would
give rise to liability for Damages to Acquiror under this Article 11); and
(ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Acquiror), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
the alleged Damages based on Acquiror\'s good faith belief thereof, including
the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the
extent reasonably available to Acquiror) and copies of any formal demand or
complaint, the amount of Damages, the date each such item was incurred, paid
or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the
specific nature of the breach to which such item is related.   (c) The
Acquiror may submit a Notice of Claim at any time during the period
commencing with the Effective Time and ending on the one year anniversary of
the Effective Time (the "SURVIVAL PERIOD"), but shall not be permitted to
bring a Notice of Claim at any time after the expiration of the Survival
Period (and any delivery or attempted delivery of a Notice of Claim after
such time shall be void and of no force or effect). Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, any Claims for Damages specified in any
Notice of Claim delivered to the Representative prior to expiration of
the Survival Period shall remain outstanding until such Claims for Damages
have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the expiration of the
Survival Period. Until the expiration of the Survival Period, no delay on the
part of Acquiror in giving the Representative a Notice of Claim shall relieve
any Effective Time Holder from any of its obligations under this Article 11
unless (and then only to the extent that) the Representative or the Effective
Time Holders are materially prejudiced thereby.   11.6 Defense of Third-
Party Claims.   (a) Acquiror shall determine and conduct the defense or
settlement of any claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation,
inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against Acquiror (in each such
case, a "THIRD-PARTY CLAIM") and the costs and expenses incurred by Acquiror
in connection with such defense or settlement (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, other professionals\' and experts\' fees and court or
arbitration costs) shall be included in the Damages for which Acquiror may
seek indemnification pursuant to a Claim made hereunder.   (b) The
Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings,
notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim to the
extent that receipt of such documents by the Representative does not affect
any privilege relating to Acquiror and may participate in, but not
to determine or conduct, any defense of the Third-Party Claim or
settlement negotiations with respect to the Third-Party Claim.   (c) No
settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third party claimant shall
be determinative of the existence of or amount of Damages relating to such
matter, except with the consent of the Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be
deemed to have been given unless the Representative   65   shall have
objected within 15 days after a written request for such consent by Acquiror.
In the event that the Representative has consented to any such settlement,
neither the Representative nor any Effective Time Holder shall have any power
or authority to object under any provision of this Article 11 to the amount
of any claim by or on behalf of Acquiror against the Escrow Cash or Effective
Time Holders for indemnity with respect to such settlement.   11.7
Resolution of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim given by Acquiror shall
be resolved as follows:   (a) Uncontested Claims. If, within 15 business
days after a Notice of Claim is received by the Representative, the
Representative does not contest such Notice of Claim in writing to Acquiror
as provided in Section 11.7(b), the Representative shall be conclusively
deemed to have consented, on behalf of all Effective Time Holders, (i) to the
recovery by Acquiror of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of
Claim in accordance with this Article 11, including the forfeiture of Escrow
Cash, solely to the extent that such Damages do not exceed the amount of
Escrow Cash then held in escrow by the Escrow Agent, and (ii) without further
notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for damages
against the Effective Time Holders for such amount in any court having
jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.   (b) Contested Claims.
If the Representative gives Acquiror written notice contesting all or any
portion of a Notice of Claim (a "CONTESTED CLAIM") (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent) within the 15 business day period specified in Section 11.7(a), then
such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement
agreement executed by Acquiror and the Representative (a copy of which shall
be furnished to the Escrow Agent) or (ii) in the absence of such a written
settlement agreement within 30 business days following receipt by Acquiror of
the written notice from the Representative, by binding litigation between
Acquiror and the Representative in accordance with the terms and provisions
of Section 11.7(c).   (c) Litigation of Contested Claims. Either Acquiror or
the Representative may bring suit in the courts of the State of California
and the Federal courts of the United States of America located within the
County of Santa Clara in the State of California to resolve the Contested
Claim. Regardless of which party brings suit to resolve a matter, Acquiror
shall bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that
Acquiror is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 11. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 11.8(c), in any suit hereunder in
which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Notice of Claim is at
issue, Acquiror shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless the
trial court awards Acquiror more than one-half of the amount in dispute;
otherwise, the Representative and Effective Time Holders shall be deemed to
be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to a suit shall pay its
own expenses and the expenses, including attorneys\' fees and costs,
reasonably incurred by the other party to the suit.   11.8 Release of
Remaining Escrow Cash. Within five business days following the expiration of
the Survival Period, Acquiror shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to
the Effective Time Holders all of the Escrow Cash then remaining in escrow
under the Escrow Agreement (if any) in excess of any amount of Escrow Cash
that is necessary to satisfy all   66   unresolved, unsatisfied or
disputed claims for Damages specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the
Representative before the expiration of the Survival Period. If any Claims
are unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the expiration of the Survival
Period, then the Escrow Agent shall retain possession and custody of that
amount of Escrow Cash that equals the total maximum amount of Damages then
being claimed by Acquiror in all such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed
Claims, and as soon as all such Claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to the Effective Time Holders all remaining Escrow Cash
(if any) not required to satisfy such Claims.   11.9 Tax Consequences of
Indemnification Payments. All payments (if any) made to Acquiror pursuant to
any indemnification obligations under this Article 11 will be treated as
adjustments to the purchase price for tax purposes and such agreed treatment
will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by
law.   ARTICLE 12  MISCELLANEOUS   12.1 Governing Law. The internal laws
of the State of California, irrespective of its conflicts of law principles,
shall govern the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms,
and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the
parties hereto. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California and the Federal courts
of the United States of America located within the County of Santa Clara in
the State of California solely in respect of the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred
to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including resolution of disputes under Section 11.8(c)), and
hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it
is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such a California State or Federal court. The parties
hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of
such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 12.9 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue
shall lie solely in Santa Clara County, California.   12.2 Assignment;
Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of the successors and assigns of Acquiror, including any successor
to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and assets of
Acquiror. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no party hereto may
assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this provision shall be
void.   67    12.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable
provision.   12.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party
whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or
more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.   12.5 Other
Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such
party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of
any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any State having jurisdiction.   12.6 Amendments and
Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended, and the
observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or
in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only by
a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The waiver by a party of
any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default.
This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto as provided in this
Section 12.6 at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
Company Shareholders, but, after such adoption, no amendment shall be made
which by Applicable Law requires the further approval of the Company
Shareholders without obtaining such further approval. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, each of Company and Acquiror, by action taken by its
Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to it contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit
contained herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective unless
signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is
asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter
to enforce such provisions.   12.7 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is
successfully consummated, each party shall bear its respective legal,
auditors\', investment bankers\' and financial advisors\' fees and other
expenses incurred with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   68    12.8 Attorneys\' Fees. Should
suit be brought to enforce or interpret any part of this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as an element of the costs of
suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys\' fees to be fixed by the court
(including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal). The prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit, regardless of whether such
suit proceeds to final judgment.   12.9 Notices. All notices and other
communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing

certified or registered first-class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by
