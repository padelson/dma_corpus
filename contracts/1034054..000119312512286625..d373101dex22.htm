(d) If at any time after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing,
any change in the number of outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall

exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu

otherwise have been entitled by the Average Stock Closing Price.

2.7 _Merger Consideration Certificates; Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date hereof, the Company shall
mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record of a Unit Certificate,
except Unit Certificates representing Excluded Units to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_ (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration
Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Merger
Consideration Certificates held by such Person (or another Person on behalf of
such Person) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Merger
Consideration Certificates to (A) Parent, if prior to the Closing, and (B)
the Exchange Agent, if subsequent to the Closing, and shall be substantially
in the form set forth in _Exhibit L-1_ for holders who are not Stockholder
Members, and in the form set forth in _Exhibit L-2_ for holders who are
Stockholder Members, and have such other provisions (including representations
regarding ownership of Units represented by such Merger Consideration
Certificates) as the Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (each, a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Merger Consideration Certificates in exchange for, at the Closing, the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section
2.4(c)_, and after the Closing, the other applicable amounts set forth in
_Section 2.4(c)_, in each case with respect to each Unit represented by such
Merger Consideration Certificates. Upon surrender of a Merger Consideration
Certificate for cancellation, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly
completed and validly executed, the holder of such Merger Consideration
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore with respect
to each Unit represented by such Merger Consideration Certificate, the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_
at the Closing, and the other applicable amounts set forth in  _Section
2.4(c)_, after the Closing. If issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Merger Consideration
Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
such issuance that such Merger Consideration Certificate be accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this  _Section 2.7_, each Merger Consideration Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender with respect to each Unit represented by
such Merger Consideration Certificate the applicable portion of the amounts
set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_.

 



33 (b) The Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Merger
Consideration Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof, plus the
right to receive the other amounts set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_, shall be
deemed to have been issued and granted in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Unit, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving LLC of the Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Merger Consideration
Certificates are presented to the Surviving LLC or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Section
2.7_.

 

(c) Subject to this _Section 2.7(c_), any portion of the Closing Stock Merger
Consideration that remains undistributed to the Members for 180 calendar days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any
Member that has not previously complied with this _Section 2.7_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent, as an unsecured creditor, for payment of its
claim for its respective portion of the Merger Consideration and the other
amounts set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_ in accordance with _Section 2.5_
hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving LLC, Members Representative
nor the Exchange Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, be liable to any Member for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amount the Members are
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(c) remaining undistributed to
Members immediately prior to such time as such Merger Consideration or other
amount would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

2.8 _Cash Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Cash Merger Consideration
shall be subject to adjustment as provided below:

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth its good faith estimate of the (i) Closing Working Capital and the
resulting Working Capital Overage or Working Capital Underage (the " _Working
Capital Estimate_ "), (ii) Credit Facility Payoff Amount, and (iii) Closing
Cash Merger Consideration, in each case determined in accordance with the
Accounting Methodology.

 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Members Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") of its
calculation of the (i) Closing Working Capital and the resulting Working
Capital Overage or Working Capital Underage, (ii) Credit Facility Payoff
Amount, and (iii) Closing Cash Merger Consideration, in each case determined
in accordance with the Accounting Methodology.

 



34 (c) The Post-Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties hereto and the Members on the thirtieth (30th) day following the
date on which the Post-Closing Statement was delivered to the Members
Representative, unless the Members Representative delivers written notice of
its disagreement with the Post-Closing Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_
") to Parent prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only
include good faith disagreements based on Closing Working Capital not being
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Methodology or an error in the
actual amount of the Credit Facility Payoff Amount. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by Parent in a timely manner, then the Post-Closing
Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final
and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (A) the date Parent and the
Members Representative resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the
date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.8(c)_. During the
fourteen (14)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
Parent and the Members Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such
fourteen (14)-day period Parent and the Members Representative have not
resolved in writing the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement,
Parent and the Members Representative shall submit to an independent
accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration, in accordance
with the standards set forth in this _Section 2.8(c)_, only matters that
remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be Grant Thornton LLP or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the
Members Representative in writing. Parent and the Members Representative
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written
decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to fixing mathematical
errors and determining whether the items in dispute were determined in
accordance with the Accounting Methodology and the Accounting Firm is not to
make any other determination, including any determination as to whether the
Working Capital Base Amount, Working Capital Estimate or Closing Cash Merger
Consideration are correct. The Accounting Firms decision shall be based
solely on written submissions by Parent and Members Representative and
their respective representatives and not by independent review and shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be final and binding on all of
the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. To the full extent
permitted by law, judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which
such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ shall be borne by the Members
Representative, on the one hand (on behalf of the Members and from the
Members Representative Holdback), and the Parent, on the other hand, in
proportion to the final allocation made by such Accounting Firm of the
disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by the
Members Representative and Parent, such that the prevailing party pays the
lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses.

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Final Closing Working Capital_
" means the Closing Working Capital, as finally agreed or determined in
accordance with

 



35   _Section 2.8(c)_, (ii) the " _Final Credit Facility Payoff Amount_ " means
the Credit Facility Payoff Amount, as finally agreed or determined in
accordance with  _Section 2.8(c)_, and (iii) " _Final Cash Merger
Consideration_ " means the Cash Merger Consideration calculated using the
Final Closing Working Capital and Final Credit Facility Payoff Amount.

 

(e) Within five (5) days after the Post-Closing Statement has become final and
binding on the parties, the Cash Merger Consideration shall be adjusted such
that the aggregate consideration paid in respect thereof in connection with
the Closing shall be increased or decreased as follows:

(i) If the Final Cash Merger Consideration is greater than the Cash Merger
Consideration, then (A) Parent shall pay to the Members that delivered an
executed Letter of Transmittal to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing in such
Letter of Transmittal, an amount equal to such excess (such amount, the "
_Working Capital Excess_ "), which shall be allocated among the Members in
accordance with _Exhibit G_ (as updated pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_); and
(B) the Members Representative and Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver to the Members that delivered an executed Letter of Transmittal to
Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in writing in such Letter of Transmittal, all of the funds
in the Working Capital Escrow Account, which shall be allocated among the
Members in accordance with _Exhibit G_ (as updated pursuant to _Section
2.4(f)_). If, after payment is made under clauses (A) and (B), there is an
undistributed amount of the Working Capital Excess or there is a balance
remaining in the Working Capital Escrow Account, Parent shall deliver, or
instruct (together with the Members Representative) the Escrow Agent to
deliver, such undistributed amount or remaining balance, as applicable, to the
Exchange Agent, and such amounts shall be held and distributed in accordance
with _Section 2.7_ and the Exchange Agent Agreement.

(ii) If the Final Cash Merger Consideration is less than the Cash Merger
Consideration, then the Members Representative and Parent shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent from the Working Capital Escrow Account, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by Parent, an amount equal to the excess of the Cash Merger
Consideration over the Final Cash Merger Consideration (such amount, the "
_Working Capital Shortfall_ "), and deliver the balance of the Working
Capital Escrow Account to all of the Members that returned an executed Letter
of Transmittal, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated in writing in such the Letter of Transmittal, which
shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with _Exhibit G_ (as
updated pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_). If, after such distribution, there is
a balance remaining in the Working Capital Escrow Account, the
Members Representative and Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver
such remaining balance to the Exchange Agent, and such amount shall be held
and distributed in accordance with _Section 2.7_. To the extent that the
Working Capital Shortfall exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount, then
Parent shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Indemnification Escrow
Account (in the case of Escrow Shares, based on the Average Stock Closing
Price) without regard to the Basket Amount, in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

 



36 (iii) Upon payment of the amounts provided in this _Section 2.8(e)_,
absent manifest error or fraud, none of the parties hereto may make or assert
any claim under this _Section 2.8_.

(f) Following the Closing, Parent shall not take any action with respect to
the accounting books and records of the Company, or the items reflected
thereon, on which the Post-Closing Statement is to be based, that is
inconsistent with the Companys past practices. No actions taken by Parent on
its own behalf or on behalf of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, on or
following the Closing Date shall be given effect for purposes of determining
the Final Closing Working Capital, Final Credit Facility Payoff Amount or
Final Cash Merger Consideration. During the period of time from and after the
Closing Date through the final determination of the Final Cash Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.8_, Parent shall afford,
and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to afford, to the
Members Representative and any accountants, counsel or financial advisers
retained by the Members Representative in connection with the review of
the Post-Closing Statement in accordance with this _Section 2.8_, direct
access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the
properties, books, contracts, personnel, representatives (including the
Companys accountants) and records of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and such representatives (including the work papers of the Companys
accountants) relevant to the review of the Post-Closing Statement and Parents
determination of Closing Working Capital, Credit Facility Amount and Cash
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.8_.

2.9  _Withholding Rights_.

(a) Each of the Surviving LLC and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Article II such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. Any withheld amounts shall be timely remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority and a receipt therefor shall be delivered to the
respective Member. Parent shall provide the Company and the Members
Representative a schedule of any state local, or foreign tax withholdings
which are expected to be withheld no later than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing. If the Members Representative disagrees with respect to any
such proposed withholding Tax, Parent and the Members Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If Parent and the Members
Representative are unable, within five (5) calendar days after receipt by
Parent of such notice of objections, to resolve the disputed items, such
disputed items will be referred to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm
shall, within five (5) calendar days, deliver to Parent and the Members
Representative a written report setting forth its determination as to such
disputed items (and only such disputed items), and such determination will be
conclusive and binding upon Parent and the Members Representative for
purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such determination
shall not relieve any Member from reimbursing Parent for any funds which were
not withheld but for which Parent is required to pay pursuant to applicable
law. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Members
Representative (on behalf of the Members).

 



37 (b) If Parent does not receive a properly executed statement in a form
reasonably acceptable to it for purposes of permitting the Parent not to
withhold Tax as provided for under the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 1445 of the Code, then the Parent shall be permitted to withhold from
the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding
Tax under Section 1445 of the Code. To the extent that such amounts are so
withheld by the Parent and paid over to the proper Governmental Authority,
such withheld and deducted amounts shall be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent.

2.10 _Lost Certificates_. If at or following the Closing any Unit Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Unit Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving LLC, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving LLC may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Parent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Unit Certificate the allocable portion of the Merger Consideration to be paid
and the other amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ (or if not yet
realized, the right to receive such other amounts) in respect of the Units
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

2.11 _Escrow Accounts_.

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with U.S. Bank, National Association

_Escrow Agent_ "): (i) a portion of the Cash Merger Consideration equal to
the Working Capital Escrow Amount and (ii) a portion of the Stock Merger
Consideration equal to the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and
the same shall be subject to reduction on the six-month anniversary of the
Closing pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the accounts into which such amounts
are deposited, the " _Working Capital Escrow Account_ " and the "
_Indemnification Escrow Account,_ " respectively). The Working Capital Escrow
Account shall be used to exclusively satisfy amounts payable to Parent, if
any, pursuant to _Section 2.8_, and, other than as provided in _Section
2.8(e)(ii)_, the Indemnification Escrow Account shall be used to exclusively
satisfy any claims of the Parent Indemnitees for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ made from and after Closing but prior to the respective
Indemnity Termination Date. Any funds or Escrow Shares in the Working Capital
Escrow Account or the Indemnification Escrow Account not so used shall be
distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to the Members
Representative, which funds or Escrow Shares shall be allocated among the
Members in accordance with _Exhibit G_ (as updated pursuant to _Section
2.4(f)_). Except as otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Shares shall be valued at the Average Stock Closing
Price.

 

(b) At any time and from time to time following the Closing, the Members
Representative may elect (on behalf of the Stockholder Members), by written
notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or
a portion of the Escrow Shares in the Indemnification Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, with the net
proceeds from any such sale remaining in escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. If at any time the Indemnification Escrow Account is comprised of
both

 



38  cash and Escrow Shares, then the Members Representative may elect (on
behalf of the Stockholder Members) to deliver either Escrow Shares (valued at
the Average Stock Closing Price), cash or any combination of Escrow Shares
and cash, in order to satisfy any Losses pursuant to _ARTICLE X_.

2.12 _Restrictions on Resale_. Except pursuant to a Marketed Secondary
Offering or an Approved Block Trade, prior to the six-month anniversary of the
Closing (the " _Restricted Period_ ") each Stockholder Member agrees not to
offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, in
excess of such Stockholder Members pro rata share in accordance with the
percentages set forth in _Exhibit G_ (as updated pursuant to _Section
2.4(f)_) (which percentages may be adjusted by the Stockholder Members as they
may agree) of 200,000 shares of the Stock Merger Consideration in any one
trading day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Investor Member may at any
time after the Closing transfer or distribute all or a portion of its Stock
Merger Consideration to any of its Permitted Transferees;  _provided_ , that
any such Permitted Transferee shall be deemed an "Investor Member" for
purposes of this _Section 2.12_.

2.13 _Restrictive Legend_.

(a) Each certificate issued pursuant to this Agreement representing the Stock
Merger Consideration shall have the following legend:

"The securities represented by this certificate are subject to certain
restrictions on transfer specified in _Section 2.12_ of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of June 25, 2012, by and among SBA Communications
Corporation, SBA 2012 Acquisition, LLC, TowerCo II Holdings LLC and TowerCo
III Holdings LLC, as the Members Representative."

(b) In connection with any sale, transfer or disposition of any Stock Merger
Consideration by any Stockholder Member in accordance with _Section 2.12_,
Parent agrees promptly to cause its transfer agent to remove the restrictive
legend on stock certificates representing shares of Stock Merger
Consideration sold, transferred or distributed to the transferees and if
necessary to instruct its counsel to promptly issue an opinion confirming to
the transfer agent the right to have such legend removed. 

2.14 _Allocation of Merger Consideration_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving LLC and the Members Representative acknowledge that the
Merger is properly viewed for U.S. federal income Tax purposes with regard to
the Parent as though Parent purchased all of the Companys assets from the
Members in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the other amounts
payable to the Members pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, plus the amount of any
liabilities treated as assumed by the Merger Sub for income tax purposes (the
" _Tax Purchase Price_ "). The Tax Purchase Price shall be allocated among
the "classes of assets" (as determined for the purposes of IRS Form 8594) of
the Company based upon the fair market values thereof in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code. No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, the Parent shall deliver to the Member Representative a statement
setting forth

 



39  such allocation of the Tax Purchase Price (the " _Initial Allocation_ ").
The Member Representative shall have the right to review and raise any
objections in writing to the Initial Allocation for fifteen (15) calendar

in the Initial Allocation, the Parent and the Member Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Parent and the Member
Representative are unable, within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt by
the Parent of such notice of objections, to resolve the disputed items, such
disputed items will be referred to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm
shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, deliver to the Parent and the Member
Representative a written report setting forth its determination as to such
disputed items (and only such disputed items), and such determination will be
conclusive and binding upon the Parent and the Members Representative
for purposes of the Final Allocation. The fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parent and fifty
percent (50%) by the Members Representative (on behalf of the Members). Each
of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving LLC and the Members Representative
agree (a) to act in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule in the
preparation of financial statements and the filing of all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594), (b) not to voluntarily take any position
inconsistent therewith in the course of any Tax audit or other proceeding,
unless required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements (including a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code (or any
comparable provision of any state, local or foreign law)), and (c) to provide
the other promptly with any other information reasonably required to timely

used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it requires such
qualification, license or registration, except where the failure to be so

any material respect under any of such Ground Lease, which default remains

ARTICLE V

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

As a material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

5.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

(a) Parent is a corporation and Merger Sub is a limited liability company,
duly organized, validly existing, or formed, respectively, and in good
standing under the laws of their states of organization, with full
organizational power and authority to conduct their respective businesses as
they are now being conducted, to own, lease or use their respective properties
and assets that they purport to own, lease or use, and to perform all of their
respective obligations under all other Contracts to which they are a
party. Parent and Merger Sub are, or will by the Closing Date be, duly
qualified, licensed or registered to do business as foreign entities and are
(or will be) in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) under the laws of
each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership, lease or use
of the properties owned, leased or used by them, or the nature of the
activities conducted by them, requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or registered or in good standing (or
the equivalent thereof) would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purposes of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in
any business activities, conducted any operations or incurred any liabilities,
other than liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.2 _Duly Authorized_. Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate or
limited liability company authority and power to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the closing documents to which each of them is or will be a
party (the " _Parent Closing Documents_ ") and to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the Parent Closing Documents to which
each of them is or will be a party. The execution and delivery of this

 



60  Agreement and each of the Parent Closing Documents, as well as the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability
company action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate or
limited liability company action or other proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, the Parent Closing Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby on the part of Parent or Merger Sub.

5.3 _Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub, and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, constitutes the legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. Upon the execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Parent Closing Documents to which either of them is a
party, the Parent Closing Documents will constitute the legal, valid, and
binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

5.4 _No Conflicts_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Parent Closing Documents nor the consummation and performance of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by Parent and Merger Sub will,
directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) (a)
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of any provision of the
Organizational Documents of Parent and Merger Sub, (b) contravene, conflict
with, or result in a violation or breach of any provision of, or give
any Person the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under, any
material Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or any of the
assets owned or used by Parent or Merger Sub may be subject, or (c) violate in
any material respect any existing applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment,
order or decree of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties.

 

5.5 _No Consents_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to give any notice to or obtain any
consent or approval from any Person in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Parent Closing Documents or the consummation
or performance of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including, without limitation, any Person who is a party to any
material Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party).

 

5.6 _Capitalization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parents capital stock
consists of (i) 400,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which
121,460,059 shares were validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and

to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Parent Closing
Documents on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Parent Closing
Documents. Each of Parent and Merger Sub confirm that it is not a condition to

Merger Sub obtain financing for or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.8 _Legal Proceedings and Orders_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that challenges,
or that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal, or
otherwise interfering with, the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Parent Closing Documents. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is subject to any Order which could, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.9 _Compliance with Legal Requirements and Governmental Authorizations_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all licenses, franchises, permits
and authorizations of any Governmental Authorities as are necessary for the
lawful conduct of the business of Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, "
_Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such Parent Permits
would not reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay
the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of (i)
any Legal Requirement applicable to such Persons or (ii) any Parent Permits.

 



62 5.10 _Investment Purpose_. Parent and Merger Sub will be purchasing the Units
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, the distribution thereof in violation of applicable federal,
state or provincial securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
the sale of the Units hereunder has not been registered under the Securities
Act or any state securities laws, and that the Units may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act, pursuant to an exemption from

that it is an "Accredited Investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D of the Securities Act.

5.13 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed with the SEC true and complete copies of all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and any definitive proxy or information
statements required to be filed by Parent pursuant to the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2008 (the " _SEC Filings_ "), each of which has complied in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as in effect on the date so filed, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC Filing
filed or furnished to the SEC by Parent and in either case, publicly available
prior to June 22, 2012 or as set forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)_ of the Schedules
delivered by Parent to the Company on the date hereof. None of the SEC Filings
(including, any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein) contained when filed, and any SEC Filings filed with the
SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent updated,
amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC Filing.

 

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent SEC Filing filed on or prior to the date hereof, all of the
financial statements included in the SEC Filings, in each case, including any
related notes thereto, as filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are
collectively referred to as the " _Parent Financial Statements_ "), have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as may be permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, year-end audit adjustments which could not reasonably be expected to
be material, individually or in the aggregate). The consolidated balance
sheets (including the related notes) 

 



63  included in such Parent Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated,
amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent SEC Filing) fairly present, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows (in
each case, including the related notes) included in such Parent Financial
Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a
subsequent SEC Filing) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows
of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods indicated,
subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit
adjustments which could not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate. 

(c) Parent has designed and maintains a system of "internal controls over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 

(d) The management of Parent has (i) implemented disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent by others within those entities, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to
Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of
Parent (A) all significant deficiencies and material weakness in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting. Neither Parent nor any of its
consolidated Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any kind
whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute,
that are material to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in
the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2011, including the notes thereto, contained in the SEC
Filings, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2011, and (iv) other liabilities or obligations that are not otherwise
covered by insurance that were not, and could not reasonably be expected to
be, material and adverse to the financial condition, businesses, results of
operations, properties or assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

5.14 _Status under the Securities Act_. At the time of filing
the Registration Statement, and at the time of each post-effective amendment
thereto, including by way of a Section 10(a)(3) post-effective amendment,
Parent (i) was a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act) and (ii) was not an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act).

 



64 5.15 _Private Placement_. No registration under the Securities Act is required
for the offer and sale of the Stock Merger Consideration by Parent to the
Stockholder Members as contemplated hereby.

5.16 _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. The Parent Common Stock is
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Parent has taken
no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have the effect
of, terminating the registration of the Parent Common Stock under the
Exchange Act nor has Parent received any notification that the SEC is
contemplating terminating such registration. Parent has not, in the 12 months
preceding the date hereof, received notice from Nasdaq or any trading market
on which Parent Common Stock is or has been listed or quoted to the effect
that Parent is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements
of such trading market. Parent is in compliance with all such listing and
maintenance requirements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement do not violate the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Stock
Market.

5.17 _Brokers_. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which fees shall be
paid by Parent, no broker, finder or similar intermediary has acted for or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no broker, finder, agent or similar
intermediary is entitled to any brokers, finders or similar fee or other
commission in connection therewith based on any agreement with Parent or
Merger Sub or any action taken by them.

5.18 _Independent Review_. In entering this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
have relied solely upon their own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or
representatives makes any representation or warranty, either express or
implied as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided
or made available to Parent and Merger Sub or their respective agents or
Representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement except as expressly
set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ of this Agreement.

reasonably request. Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
treat all information provided to or obtained by Parent or
its representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ as confidential
information for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement (" _Confidential
Information_ ") and, in the event of the termination of this Agreement for any

deems necessary or appropriate, provided that Parent will not take or permit
any of its Representatives to take, any action, including boring, drilling or
other soil or groundwater testing, in its investigation of any Tower Site

equipment on or communications operations being conducted at a Tower Site,
without the Companys prior written consent, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld. Parent shall indemnify the Company and its Affiliates
for any claims, losses or causes of action caused by, or incurred in
connection with, Parents inspection of the Tower Sites or other due
diligence activities occurring prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that
Parent shall not be required to indemnify the Company or its Affiliates for
any claim, loss or cause of action caused by the negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company or such Affiliate. Before conducting any physical
inspection or testing at any Tower Sites, Parent shall obtain, and during the
period of such inspection or testing shall maintain, at its expense, wide
cover commercial general liability insurance for bodily injury or property
damage in an amount not less than $10 million for any one occurrence,
including a contractual liability endorsement, and personal injury liability
coverage, on an "occurrence basis" with the Company as beneficiary, from an
insurer reasonably acceptable to the Company. Before making entry upon any
Tower Site, Parent shall furnish to the Company certificates of insurance
evidencing the foregoing coverage.

(d) Parent reaffirms and shall fulfill its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that references to Agent
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to include potential sources
of Parents financing for the Transaction. If for any reason, termination of
the Agreement occurs prior to Closing, the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub under the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect.

(e) Parent, its Representatives and any other Person acting on behalf and at
the direction of Parent to whom the Company shall have consented, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall have the right to contact
any Governmental Entity about any Governmental Authorizations concerning the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Towers or Tower Sites and any party
to any of the Ground Leases, Tenant Leases, or any other material contracts in
connection with its due diligence of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that in connection with such communications the
Parents inquiry with respect to Taxes shall be limited to whether the Taxes
have been paid on a specific Tower Site or Tower. To the extent that any
Governmental Authority or third party provides Parent information that would
or would reasonably be likely to impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or would or
would reasonably be likely to give rise to the breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to advise the Company.

 

6.4 _Efforts to Close; Cooperation_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all lawful actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all lawful things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective as promptly as 

 



70  practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
cooperate with the others in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) refrain
from taking, or cause to be refrained from taking, any action and to refrain
from doing or causing to be done, anything which would reasonably be expected
to impede or impair the prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (A)
obtain all necessary waivers, consents, releases and approvals that are
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) obtain all consents, approvals and authorizations that
are required by this Agreement to be obtained under any Legal Requirement,
(C) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (D) effect all necessary registrations and
filings, including, but not limited to, filings and submissions of information
requested or required by any Governmental Authority and (E) fulfill all
conditions to this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub further
covenant and agree, with respect to any threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be. In no event, however,
will the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
be obligated to pay any money to any Person or to offer or grant other
financial or other accommodations to any Person in connection with its
obligations under this  _Section 6.4_. If prior to the Closing Date, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company breaches any representation or warranty
hereunder that is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ not to be satisfied, then the Company will notify Parent of
such breach. If prior the Closing Date, to the Knowledge of Parent, Parent or
Merger Sub breaches any representation or warranty hereunder that is
reasonably likely to cause the condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ not to
be satisfied, then Parent will notify the Company of such breach.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that any breach of the
obligation to notify the other party pursuant to the immediately
preceding two sentences will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
(including the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing in Article 7 and
Article 8 and indemnification in Article X) only as a breach of the underlying
representation or warranty and not as an independent breach of a covenant or
agreement.

6.5 _Corporate Name_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Excluded
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates have the absolute and exclusive
proprietary rights, by ownership or license, to use all trade names
incorporating "TowerCo" and "TCO", each by itself or in combination with any
other name and the corporate design logo associated with "TowerCo" and "TCO"
and its respective color schemes, and that none of the rights thereto or
goodwill represented thereby or pertaining thereto are being assigned or
transferred, hereby or in connection herewith. Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they will not, nor will they permit any of their Affiliates to (including
after the Closing, the Company and any Company Subsidiary), use any name,
phrase or logo incorporating "TowerCo" or "TCO" or such corporate design logo
or its color scheme in or on any of its literature, sales materials,
agreements or products or otherwise in connection with the sale of any
products or services or in the operation of the Towers, Tower Sites and
Property. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at or as soon as
possible following the Closing Date, but in no event later than twenty (20)
days following the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, change the name of the Company and each Company Subsidiary so
that they cease to use the "TowerCo" and "TCO" name.

 



71 6.6 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing that Paul,
Weiss has acted as legal counsel to certain Members and the Members
Representative, and has acted as legal counsel to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Paul, Weiss will continue to act
as legal counsel to certain Members, the Members Representative and the
Excluded Subsidiaries after the Closing, the Company hereby waives, on its own
behalf and agrees to cause the Company Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts
that may arise in connection with Paul, Weiss representing any Members, the
Members Representative or any Excluded Subsidiaries after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that
neither Parent, the Company, the Surviving LLC nor any Company Subsidiary
shall seek to have Paul, Weiss disqualified from representing any Member, the
Members Representative, any Excluded Subsidiary or their respective
Affiliates in any dispute (whether in contract or tort) that may arise between
the Company, the Surviving LLC, any Company Subsidiary or their respective
Affiliates formerly represented by Paul, Weiss, on the one hand, and any
Member, the Members Representative, any Excluded Subsidiary or their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in whole or in part.

6.7 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving LLC, and the
Members Representative agrees for U.S. federal income Tax purposes to treat
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as (i) a sale of the equity
interests of the Company by the Members, producing a termination of the
Company pursuant to Section 708(b)(1) of the Code (and any similar provision
of state and local income Tax law) and (ii) pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6,
Parents purchase of the assets of the Company. In addition, each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving LLC and the Members Representative
agrees to allocate the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and other
Tax items of the Company to the Members for the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date by using a "closing of the books" method (as described in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.706-1(c), and not by estimating the pro rata
portion of such items) as of the end of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that
any extraordinary transactions occurring after the Closing on the Closing
Date shall be deemed to occur on the day after the Closing Date.

(b) Parent will not cause or permit the Surviving LLC or any Company
Subsidiary to (i) file an amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing
Taxable Period or make or change any material Tax election with an effective
date prior to the Closing Date or (ii) take any Tax position on any Tax Return
that is inconsistent with past practice if such position materially increases
the Tax liability of the Company or the Members, in each case without the
Members Representatives prior written consent or unless otherwise required
by applicable law.

 

(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor the Members
Representative are guaranteeing the existence of any Tax assets or any Tax
positions taken or to be taken after the Closing Date.

 



72 (d) _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Members Representative shall control and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods which end on or prior to the Closing Date, at Members
Representatives expense (on behalf of the Members). The Members
Representative shall control any Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding or any other controversy with respect to Taxes of the
Companies or the Company Subsidiaries that relate to any taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Members Representative to give effect to the provisions of this _Section
6.7(d)_, including by, providing Members Representative access to the books
and records of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, executing such
powers of attorney and signing and filing Tax Returns necessary to implement
the foregoing.

(e) Parent shall control and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of
each of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending after the Closing Date. Except to the extent taken into account in
determining the adjustments to the Closing Cash Merger Consideration provided
for in  _Section 2.8_ with respect to Real Estate Taxes or Personal Property
Taxes, the Members Representative (on behalf of the Members) will remit to
the Parent not less than 7 days prior to the due date (or extended due date)
all Taxes due on Tax Returns for the portion of a Straddle Period (as defined
below) ending on the Closing Date. In the case of a Tax Return with respect to
a taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (such
period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (unless required by applicable law), and
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall be, (A) in the case of Taxes based on
income or receipts determined under the closing of the books method (or
hypothetical closing of the books method if an actual closing of the books is
not available) and (b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts
which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes with respect to such
periods under the relevant Tax law) (or in the case of such Taxes determined
on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Parent shall
deliver any such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period (together with any
schedules, work papers and other documentation then available that are
relevant to the preparation of such Tax Returns) to the Members
Representative for its review and approval at least thirty (30) days prior to
the date such Tax Returns are required to be filed, or, with respect to sales
and use taxes, at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Tax Returns are
required to be filed. If, within 20 days after the receipt of the Straddle
Period Tax Return, or five (5) days in the case of a tax return relating to
sales and use tax, the Member Representative (a) notifies Parent that it
disputes the manner of preparation of the Straddle Period Tax Return or the
Pre-Closing Taxes calculated in the Straddle Tax Return and (b) provides
Parent with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its computation
of the Pre-Closing Taxes and its proposed form of the Straddle Tax Return,
then Parent and the Members Representative shall attempt to resolve their
disagreement within 5 days following the Members Representatives
notification of Parent of such disagreement. If Parent and the Members
Representative are not able to resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall
be submitted to an independent accounting firm (the

 



73  "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm will resolve the disagreement within
30 days after the date on which they are engaged or as soon as possible
thereafter. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be binding on the
parties. The cost of the services of the Accounting Firm will be borne half by
the Members Representative (on behalf of the Members) and half by Parent.

 

6.8 _Release from Employment Contracts_. On or before the Closing Date, and as
provided for in the Restructuring Agreement, the Company and each affected
employee shall execute an amendment to each of the employment contracts listed
on _Schedule 6.8_ in a form attached to the Restructuring Agreement such that
the Company and any Company Subsidiary are no longer parties to such
employment contracts and are released from any and all of their respective
obligations thereunder.

6.9 _Tower Bonds_. The parties hereto acknowledge that on or prior to the
Closing, Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall, at its option, (i) cause
each Tower Bond to be replaced (for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have
no obligation to obtain the Tower Bond previously posted by the Company),
(ii) for each Tower Bond, obtain a "back-to-back" letter of credit, bond or
other security interest (reasonably acceptable to the lenders under the Credit
Facility who are the current issuers of such Tower Bond or have provided a
letter of credit or other credit support in connection with such Tower Bond
(the " _Current Issuers_ ")), or (iii) for each Tower Bond, otherwise
collateralize the obligations of the Current Issuers, in each case, such that
the Company can satisfy the condition set forth in _Section 7.8_ to obtain
from the lenders under the Credit Facility payoff letters which authorize the
release of all liens securing such Credit Facility upon payment in full
(assuming all other conditions to the release of such liens are satisfied).
Parent hereby agrees to indemnify the Members, the Excluded Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates for any claims, losses or causes of action
resulting from, caused by, or incurred in connection with, the failure of
Parent to cause clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) to occur on or prior to the Closing
Date. Neither the Members, the Excluded Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to maintain any Tower
Bonds following the Closing Date.

6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any fact, event,
change, occurrence, circumstance or development, whether arising prior to, on
or after the date hereof, that, to the Knowledge of Parent, (a) results in or
is reasonably likely to result in an inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company hereunder, or
(b) causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth _Article
7_ not to be satisfied.

6.11 _Restructuring; Notice to Members_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the parties to the Restructuring Agreement shall consummate the Restructuring
prior to the Closing.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice of the taking of any vote, consent or
other action by less than unanimous written consent to those Members holding
Class A Units and who are entitled thereto under _Section 4.06(b)_ of the LLC
Agreement, including in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the
Restructuring Agreement or the Restructuring.

 



74 6.12 _Contracts with Affiliates_. Prior to or at the Closing, all Contracts
between the Company or a Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any
Excluded Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or a
Company Subsidiary), on the other hand, shall be terminated in full effective
as of the Closing Date (such termination to be effected to provide that (a)
the applicable Excluded Subsidiary or Affiliate party thereto unconditionally
and irrevocably waives any claims that such Excluded Subsidiary or Affiliate
has against the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary and (b) Parent,
the Company and its Affiliates will not have any liability following the
Closing Date with respect to such Contract).

6.13 _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement; Effectiveness of Registration
Statement_.

(a)

(i) Parent has an effective automatic shelf registration statement on
Form S-3 registering the transfer or sale of Parent Common Stock and no stop
order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any part
thereof has been issued. The Registration Statement, any post-effective
amendment thereto, the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement
(the " _Base Prospectus_ ") and any prospectus supplement relating to the
transfer or sale of the Stock Merger Consideration filed with the SEC pursuant
to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the " _Prospectus Supplement_ " and
together with the Base Prospectus, the " _Prospectus_ "), each as they may be
amended or supplemented from time to time), together with the exhibits thereto
and the documents incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " _Registration Statement_."

(ii) Parent hereby agrees that it will have as of the Closing Date and at all
times prior to the termination of the Restricted Period, other than during a
Suspension Period (as defined below) permitted by  _Section 6.14_, an
effective Registration Statement permitting the transfer or sale of the Stock
Merger Consideration. Parent shall notify each Stockholder Member of any stop
order issued or threatened to be issued by the SEC in connection with the
Registration Statement and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

(b) Parent hereby agrees that:

(i) the Registration Statement conforms and, at any time that the
Registration Statement is available for use in connection with the transfer or
resale of the Stock Merger Consideration will conform, in all material
respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except during any Suspension Period permitted by
_Section 6.14(b)_,

(ii) the Registration Statement does not contain and at any time that the
Registration Statement is available for use in connection with the transfer or
resale of the Stock Merger Consideration will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made not misleading, except

 



75  during any Suspension Period permitted by _Section 6.14(b)_; _provided_ ,
that no representation or warranty is made as to information contained in or
omitted from the Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information relating to the Stockholder Members furnished to
Parent by the Stockholder Members or any representatives on behalf of the
Stockholder Members expressly for use in the Registration Statement; and

(iii) the Prospectus, at any time that such Prospectus is available for use in
connection with the transfer or resale of the Stock Merger Consideration,
will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except during any Suspension Period permitted
by _Section 6.14_; _provided_ , that no representation or warranty is made
as to information contained in or omitted from such Prospectus in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information relating to the Stockholder
Members furnished to Parent by the Stockholder Members or any representatives
on behalf of the Stockholder Members expressly for use in such Prospectus.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any outstanding
obligations to register for resale shares of Parent Common Stock. Except with
the written consent of the Stockholder Members then holding a majority of the
Stock Merger Consideration that remains unsold (other than to a Permitted
Transferee in accordance with _Section 2.12_), prior to the earlier of (1)
termination of the Restricted Period or (2) sale of all of the Stock Merger
Consideration, Parent will not grant any Person any registration rights
relating to the Parent Common Stock that are more favorable than, or
inconsistent with, any of the registration rights contained herein.

6.14 _Prospectus Supplement; Marketed Secondary Offering_.

(a) Parent agrees to provide each Stockholder Member with a copy of the
Member Questionnaire on the date hereof, to the extent not provided prior to
the date hereof. Parent covenants and agrees to prepare and file with the SEC
the Prospectus Supplement registering the transfer and/or resale of the Stock
Merger Consideration within one (1) Business Day after receipt of fully
completed Member Questionnaires from any Stockholder Member; _provided_ that
if such Member Questionnaires are delivered at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, then the Prospectus Supplement shall be filed
immediately after the Closing. During the Restricted Period, Parent will
thereafter file an additional prospectus supplement once every fifteen (15)
calendar days for two (2) consecutive months registering the transfer and/or
resale of that portion of the Stock Merger Consideration covered by additional
Member Questionnaires; _provided_ , that with respect to the Prospectus
Supplement due after the first and third 15-day periods only, the shares of
Stock Merger Consideration to be registered or transferred among the
Stockholder Members represent at least ten percent (10%) of the Stock
Merger Consideration. From the end of the two (2) month period and
thereafter, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of additional Member
Questionnaires, Parent shall file a prospectus supplement registering the
transfer and/or resale of that portion of the Stock Merger Consideration
covered by such Member Questionnaires; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to file more than one prospectus supplement per month.
Parent further agrees to file 

 



76  promptly with the SEC any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus that
may, in the judgment of Parent, be required by the Securities Act or requested
by the SEC. During the Restricted Period, Parent agrees to advise each
Stockholder Member, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is filed and to
promptly deliver such number of Prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto as the Stockholder Members may reasonably request.

(b) Parent covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep
the Registration Statement continuously effective until the earlier of (i) the
termination of the Restricted Period, or (ii) the date that all the Stock
Merger Consideration shall have been disposed of or sold by the Stockholder
Members (the " _Registration Period_ "). Parent may suspend the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement and the use of any Prospectus included therein
in the event, and for such period of time as (i) such a suspension is
required by the rules and regulations of the SEC as applied to Parent, (ii)
such Prospectus Supplement ceases to meet the requirements of Section 10 of
the Securities Act or (iii) in the good faith determination by Parents board
of directors, offers and sales pursuant to the Registration Statement should
not be made by reason of the existence of material undisclosed circumstances
or developments with respect to which the disclosure that would be
required in the Registration Statement would be premature and would have an
adverse effect on Parent (each a " _Suspension Event_ " and the period during
which the Suspension Event continues to be true, a " _Suspension Period_
"). Parent will immediately advise each Stockholder Member of any Suspension
Event, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Suspension Period to terminate at the earliest possible date; _provided_ ,
that Parent may not initially suspend the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement for a period of more than 45 days (the " _Initial Suspension Period_
"); _provided_ , that Parent may extend the Initial Suspension Period for up
to (i) an additional forty-five (45) days if the Initial Suspension Period
began within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, (ii) an additional seventy-
five (75) days if the Initial Suspension Period began more than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), solely to
the extent that Parent requires such extension of time to complete financial
statements required under applicable law to be contained in Parents SEC
filings;  _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may not commence a new
Suspension Period within 15 Business Days of the expiration of the preceding
Suspension Period. Following receipt of any such notice, and until such
Suspension Period is terminated, the Stockholder Members will not make use of
the Prospectus and will not make any sales requiring delivery of such
Prospectus. Parent also agrees to notify each Stockholder Member immediately
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Registration
Statement, as then in effect, or any Prospectus would contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein (in the case of a Prospectus, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made), not misleading, and
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly update and/or correct
such Registration Statement and Prospectus.

 

(c) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, if at the time of any
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, including by way of a
Section 10(a)(3) amendment, Parent is not a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) or is an "ineligible issuer" (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act), or is otherwise not permitted
to utilize an automatic shelf registration statement under the Securities Act,
Parent shall promptly, and in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
after 

 



77  being unable to use an automatic shelf registration statement, file a
registration statement on Form S-3, or any other appropriate form, registering
the transfer and/or resale of the Stock Merger Consideration and the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this _Section 6.14_
regarding the Registration Statement and any Prospectus shall apply to such
new registration statement and prospectus. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause that registration statement to become effective as
promptly as possible.

(d) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall take
all actions set forth in this _Section 6.14(d)_ to permit the Stockholder
Members to sell all or a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration in one
Marketed Secondary Offering.

(i) If any Stockholder Member proposes to resell any of the Stock Merger
Consideration through a Marketed Secondary Offering, such Stockholder Member
shall provide Parent and each other Stockholder Member notice of such intent
no later than twenty (20) calendar days prior to such proposed offering ("
_Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering_ "). Upon notice from
Stockholder Members representing in excess of 50% of the Stock Merger
Consideration issued at the Closing of its or their intent to sell all or any
portion of the Stock Merger Consideration through a Marketed Secondary
Offering, Parent shall, within seven (7) calendar days of receiving such
Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering, either (i) notify the
Stockholder Members either included in the Notice of Proposed Marketed
Secondary Offering or that otherwise notified Parent of its or their desire
to have shares of Stock Merger Consideration included in the proposed Marketed
Secondary Offering that it intends to exercise its rights to delay the
Marketed Secondary Offering because it intends to conduct a primary offering
of Parent Common Stock within thirty (30) calendar days of the Notice of
Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering, (ii) notify the Stockholder Members that
a Suspension Event has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) notify the
Stockholder Members of its intent to file a prospectus supplement for the
proposed Marketed Secondary Offering.

(ii) If Parent intends to exercise its right to delay the proposed Marketed
Secondary Offering in order to conduct a primary offering, the Parent shall
send each Stockholder Member notice of its intent to conduct a primary
offering and, if within fifteen (15) calendar days after the receipt of
Parents notice, any Stockholder Member shall so request in writing, Parent
shall include in such offering all or any part of the Stock
Merger Consideration owned by the Stockholder Members requested to be
included, except that if, in connection with any underwritten public offering
for the account of Parent the managing underwriter(s) thereof shall impose a
limitation on the number of shares of Parent Common Stock which may be
included because, in such underwriter(s) judgment, marketing or other factors
dictate such limitation is necessary to facilitate public distribution, then
any such limitation shall be implemented on a pro rata basis with respect to
all the Parent Common Stock that the Parent and the Stockholder Members had
initially intended to be included in such primary offering. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, unless Stock Merger Consideration representing more than 75%
of the issued Stock Merger Consideration is included in such primary offering,
such offering shall not be counted as a Marketed Secondary Offering for the
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(iii) If a Suspension Event has occurred and is continuing at the time Parent
receives the Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering, then the
obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section 6.14(d)_ shall be suspended
until the termination of such

 



78  Suspension Period at which time Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take the actions set forth in this _Section 6.14(d)_ to permit the
Stockholder Members to sell their Stock Merger Consideration in a Marketed
Secondary Offering.

(iv) If Parent has not exercised its right to delay a Proposed Marketed
Secondary Offering and if a Suspension Period has not occurred or has been
completed, then Parent, upon receipt of the name of the proposed underwriters,
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be sold and all
other information regarding the proposed offering required to be included in
the prospectus supplement, shall prepare and file a "red herring" prospectus
supplement related to such Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering. Promptly upon
pricing of such Marketed Secondary Offering, Parent shall prepare and file a
"final" prospectus supplement related to such Marketed Secondary Offering.

(e) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, in connection with up
to two offerings (either one Marketed Secondary Offering and one Approved
Block Trade or two Approved Block Trades), Parent shall enter into such
customary agreements and take all such other actions (including underwriting
agreements and causing the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial
Officer to participate in a "road show" of reasonable length based on the
recent offerings of Parent) as the underwriters reasonably request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Stock Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , in no case will any lock-up provisions required
from Parent and/or its affiliates be more restrictive than that agreed to by
Parent in its most recent equity underwriting or purchase agreement. In any
such Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade of any Stock Merger
Consideration in which the Parent will be required to execute an underwriting
agreement, Parent shall be entitled to select one manager from the list of the
Parent Approved Underwriters and the Stockholder Members participating in the
offering shall have the right to select one manager from the list of the
Members Approved Underwriters or Parent Approved Underwriters to act as joint
and equal bookrunners. The Marketed Secondary Offering shall be subject to the
agreement of all lead managers that the time and size of the Marketed
Secondary Offering is appropriate.

(f) If any Stockholder Members intend to sell any portion of the Stock Merger
Consideration through the Marketed Secondary Offering or to include any Stock
Merger Consideration in Parents primary offering, such Stockholder Members
shall agree to (i) sell such Stock Merger Consideration on the terms provided
in a customary underwriting agreement, including any lock-ups reasonably
requested by the underwriters; _provided_ , that Parent and any other sellers
in such offering also enter into lock-ups on the same terms as the lock-up
that the Stockholder Members are required to enter into, and (ii) complete
and execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting
agreement or reasonably requested by Parent.

(g) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall be
responsible for paying (i) 50% of all of the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with one Marketed Secondary Offering (together with any primary
offerings that did not constitute a Marketed Secondary Offering pursuant to
_Section 6.14(d)(ii)_) and 100% of the costs associated with one (1)
Approved Block Trade or (ii) 100% of all the costs and expenses incurred with
two Approved Block Trades (limited to registration fees, attorney fees of
Parent, fees of Parents independent public accountants, and printing
expenses associated with the preparation and

 



79  distribution of the requested prospectuses and prospectus supplements)
(whether or not such offering or trades are completed). The participating
Stockholder Members shall pay all other costs and expenses associated with a
Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade, including all of their
costs and expenses associated with such sales (including attorney fees of such
Stockholder Members and applicable stock transfer taxes and underwriting
discounts and commissions). In connection with Marketed Secondary Offering or
Approved Block Trade, to the extent required by the relevant underwriters,
Parent shall obtain so-called "comfort letters" from Parents independent
public accountants, and legal opinions of counsel to Parent addressed to the
underwriters and the SEC, in customary form and covering such matters as are
customarily covered by such letters and opinions; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall only be responsible for paying 100% of the costs and
expenses associated with up to two (2) comfort letters and legal opinions (as
set forth above) and all other costs associated with such comfort letters will
be paid by the Stockholder Members. Delivery of any such opinions or comfort
letters shall be subject to the recipient furnishing such written
representations or acknowledgements as are customarily provided by
underwriters who receive such comfort letters or opinions.

(h) Parent shall file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it
under the Exchange Act. If Parent is not required to file reports pursuant to
the Exchange Act, upon the request of any Stockholder Member, Parent shall
make publicly available the information specified in subparagraph (c)(2) of
Rule 144. Parent shall take such further action as may be reasonably required
from time to time and as may be within the reasonable control of Parent, to
enable the Stockholder Members to transfer the Stock Merger Consideration
without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by Rule 144 or any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any Stockholder Member,
Parent will deliver to such Stockholder Member a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics
thereof. In connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition by a
holder of any shares of Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to Rule 144,
Parent shall cooperate with such holder to facilitate the timely preparation
and delivery of certificates representing shares of Stock Merger Consideration
to be sold and not bearing any Securities Act legend, and enable certificates
for such shares of Stock Merger Consideration to be for such number of shares
and registered in such names as the holder may reasonably request.

(i) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall not,
directly or indirectly, (x) enter into any merger, consolidation or
reorganization in which Parent shall not be the surviving corporation or (y)
transfer or agree to transfer all or substantially all of Parents assets,
unless prior to such merger, consolidation, reorganization or asset transfer,
the surviving corporation or the transferee, respectively, shall have agreed
in writing to assume the obligations of Parent under this Agreement. 

(j) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.14_, prior to the
termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall take such other lawful
actions as are reasonably required and customary in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of the Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to a
Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade. In connection with a
Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block

 



80  Trade, Parent shall make available for inspection by (i) one authorized
representative of each participating Stockholder Member, (ii) any underwriter
participating in a Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade, and
(iii) each of their representatives, all financial and other information as
shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide such persons the
opportunity to discuss the business affairs of Parent with its principal
executives and independent public accountants who have certified the audited
financial statements included in the Registration Statement in each case as
necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility under
the Securities Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the information that Parent
determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which Parent advises such
person in writing is confidential shall not be disclosed unless such person
signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(k) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Member Indemnitee
from and against any and all Losses as incurred, arising out of or based upon
(i) any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement under which the transfer or sale of
Stock Merger Consideration was registered under the Securities Act, the
Prospectus and any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, including any "free
writing prospectus" filed by Parent, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon any omission (or
alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading except to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such untrue statements, alleged untrue
statements, omissions or alleged omissions are based solely upon written
information relating to the Stockholder Members furnished to Parent by the
Stockholder Members or any representatives on their behalf expressly for use
in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, or (ii) any
violation or alleged violation by Parent of the Securities Act, Exchange Act
or any state securities law, or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder
applicable to Parent and relating to action or inaction required of the Parent
in connection with any such Registration. If any Company Indemnitee
becomes involved in any capacity in any claim, action, or other legal
proceeding in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with
the matters contemplated in this _Section 6.14_, Parent shall reimburse such
Company Indemnitee for its reasonable legal and other reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation) as
they are incurred in connection therewith; _provided_ , that such Company
Indemnitee shall promptly repay to Parent the amount of any such reimbursed
expenses paid to it if it shall be finally judicially determined that such
Company Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification by, or contribution
from, Parent in connection with such claim, action or legal proceeding. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of a Company Indemnitee and shall survive
the transfer of the Stock Merger Consideration by the Stockholder Members. The
indemnity contained in this _Section 6.14(k)_ is the sole remedy for a
breach of this _Section 6.14(k)_ and is in lieu of any liability that Parent
may have pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ hereof.

 

(l) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company Indemnitees are
intended third-party beneficiaries of  _Section 6.14(k)_ of this Agreement.

6.15 _Financial Statements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare
an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2012 and unaudited
consolidated statements of income, members interest and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, with accompanying notes, as of and for the
six months ended June 30, 2012 (the " _Company s Interim Financial
Statements_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing will occur after
November 5,

 



81  2012, then all references to "June 30, 2012" and "six months" in the
preceding phrase shall be deemed to be references to "September 30, 2012" and
"nine months", respectively. The Companys Interim Financial Statements shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP ((i) subject to year-end accounting and
audit adjustments and (ii) applied on a consistent basis consistent with
past practices, and shall fairly present, in all material respects, the
results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the respective period set forth therein).

 

6.16 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to or at the Closing, each Member shall
deliver to Parent a certificate from such Member that states that such Member
is not a foreign person, in form and substance prescribed by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B); _provided_ , that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parents sole right if any Member
fails to provide such certificate shall be to make an appropriate withholding
under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.

6.17 _Updated Schedules_. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall
amend (i) _Exhibit G_ and (ii) _Schedules 4.17(a)(i)(1)_ (solely to reflect
new Ground Leases),  _4.17(a)(vi),_ _4.17(b)(ii)_ , _4.17(c)(1)_ , _4.17(e)_
, _4.20(b)(i)_ , _4.20(b)(ii)_ and _4.20(d)_ to reflect any Towers or Tower
Sites acquired, Towers or Tower Sites decommissioned, WIP Towers completed or
the execution of new Tenant Leases, Ground Leases or other agreements
addressed in such schedules that were executed during the period from the date
hereof to the Closing in compliance with this Agreement (the " _Updated
Schedules_ ") together with a certificate from an officer of the Company,
dated as of the Closing Date, certifying as to the accuracy and completeness
thereof. If the Closing occurs, then for purposes of determining the presence
of a breach of any representation or warranty made pursuant to this Agreement
and the corresponding rights to indemnification under ARTICLE X, the Updated
Schedules will be deemed to replace the prior schedule.

 

6.18 _Escrow Agreement_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Members
Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement in
respect of the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ").

ARTICLE IX

 

 _TERMINATION_

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated on or prior to the Closing
Date as follows:

(a) by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) at the election of Parent or the Company if the Closing Date shall not
have occurred on or before December 30, 2012 (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the terminating party is not in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
at the time of such termination;

(c) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company, if there has been a
violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement, which violation, breach
or inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1
or 7.2_ not to be satisfied, and such violation, breach or inaccuracy (i) has
not been waived by Parent, (ii) cured by the Company within twenty (20)
Business Days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from the
Parent or (iii) is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the
Termination Date; _provided_ , that the Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if, at the time of termination,
Parent or Merger Sub is in breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement and such violation, breach or
inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in  _Sections 8.1 or
8.2_ not to be satisfied;

(d) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if there has been
a material violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
agreement or covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement,
which violation, breach or inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set
forth in  _Sections 8.1 or 8.2_ not to be satisfied, and such violation,
breach or inaccuracy (i) has not been waived by the Company, (ii) cured by the
Parent within 20 Business Days after receipt by the Parent of written notice
thereof from the Company or (iii) is not reasonably capable of being cured
prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if, at the time of
termination, the Company is in breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement and such violation, breach or
inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1 or
7.2_ not to be satisfied; 

(e) subject to _Section 6.4_, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued an order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement and such order or action shall have become
final and nonappealable; or

 



85 (f) by the Company at any time from and after September 26, 2012, if the
Average Stock Closing Price on the Determination Date is less than 85% of the
Average Stock Price, subject to the following provisions of this _Section
9.1(f)_; _provided_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(f)_ unless the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions). If the
Company elects to terminate pursuant to this _Section 9.1(f)_, it shall
promptly provide written notice to Parent of such election (such notice, a "
_Trigger Event Termination Notice_ ") whereupon the Closing shall
automatically be extended for three (3) Business Days from the date of the
Trigger Event Termination Notice. During the three (3) Business Days
commencing with the receipt of such Trigger Event Termination Notice, Parent
shall have the option, but not the obligation, to increase the Cash Merger
Consideration by an amount equal to: (i) the amount that (x) 85% multiplied by

multiplied by (ii) the number of shares comprising the Stock Merger
Consideration (" _Top-up Amount_ "). If Parent elects to increase the Cash
Merger Consideration, it shall promptly, but in any case within the three-day
period after receipt of such notice, notify the Company of its intent to
increase the Cash Merger Consideration, whereupon such election shall be
binding on Parent and Merger Sub, the Companys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(f)_ shall be terminated and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except for the
adjustment to the Cash Merger Consideration). If the Company has elected to
terminate this Agreement pursuant this _Section 9.1(f)_ and Parent has not
elected to increase the Cash Merger Consideration during the three (3)
Business Day period referred to above, then this Agreement shall be
terminated, subject to  _Section 9.2_.

9.2 _Survival After Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated by the
parties in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof, this Agreement shall become
void and of no further force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
the parties hereto shall have any liability in respect of a termination of
this Agreement, except that the third sentence in _Section 6.3(c)_ (Access
to Records), this _Section 9.2_, _Section 11.1_ (Expenses), _Section 11.12_
(Governing Law), _Section 11.13_ (Consent to Jurisdiction),  _Section
11.14_ (Waiver of Jury Trial) and _Section 11.18_ (Members Representative)
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any liability for any willful and material breach of
the provisions of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude any party from
exercising their right to seek specific performance pursuant to  _Section
11.16_.

 holder of a superior interest in such Tower Site if such superior mortgage
or other lien or evidence of such ownership or other superior interest was
recorded with the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to the
recordation, if any, of the applicable Ground Lease or a memorandum thereof
(or if such Ground Lease or a memorandum thereof was not recorded at all with
such Governmental Authority), but only, in the case of this clause (z), if
such holder or owner has the right so to disturb such possession because of
the failure to record such Ground Lease or memorandum prior to the recordation
of such superior mortgage or other lien or such evidence);

 

(vi) Pre-Closing Taxes; or

(vii) the Excluded Liabilities.

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, through the Members Representative (for the benefit of the
Members), each of the Members, their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, managers, employees, equityholders, partners and members
(each, a " _Member Indemnitee_ ," and together with the Parent Indemnitees,
the " _Indemnitees_ " and each an " _Indemnitee_ "), from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by any such Indemnitee to the extent arising
from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
8.3_;

(ii) any breach of any covenant, undertaking, or agreement of Parent or

10.3 _Calculation of Losses; Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (1)
for purposes of determining "Losses" subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(iii),_ Losses resulting from any breach of
the representation set forth in _Section 4.27_ ___(Tower Cash Flow)_ shall
be equal to the product of (A) the amount by which the total actual TCF is
less than the amount set forth in _Section 4.27_ (the " _TCF Shortfall_ ")
_multiplied by_ (B) [****] (the " _Valuation Multiplier_ ") (it being
understood that the TCF Shortfall shall initially be calculated without the
application of any multiple, consideration of diminution in value, or similar
concepts). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for
any Loss pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ (other than  _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_)
to the extent that the breach or matter giving rise to such Loss also reduces
any component of TCF. By way of illustration, and not limitation, the Parent
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any breach of a
representation relating to the amount of rent payable under a Tenant Lease set
forth in _Section 4.17(b)(ii)_ if there is also a breach of the TCF
representations set forth in _Section 4.27_.

 



89 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Claim for
Losses by Indemnitees shall be payable by the applicable Indemnifying Party
until the aggregate amount of the Losses which are indemnifiable pursuant to
(i) _Sections_ _10.2(a)(i)_ , _10.2(a)(iv)_ or _10.2(a)(v)_ exceeds Twenty-
Nine Million dollars ($29,000,000), in the aggregate and (ii) _Section
10.2(a)(iii)_ exceeds Fifteen-Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (each of clauses
(i) and (ii), as applicable, a " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon a
Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses in
excess of the applicable Basket Amount. Losses claimed pursuant to _Sections
10.2(a)(ii)_ , _10.2(a)(vi)_ and _10.2(a)(vii)_ shall not be subject to a
Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
indemnification claims for Losses shall be payable by Indemnifying Party under
_Section 10.2(a)_ for (x) Losses arising from Real Estate Taxes and Personal
Property Taxes of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that were not
assessed as of the Closing Date but for which the relevant Governmental
Authority is seeking retroactive payment until the aggregate amount of Losses
that would otherwise be payable exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000), whereupon a Parent Indemitee shall be entitled to receive only
amounts for such Losses in excess of the $250,000, or (y) with respect to Real
Estate Taxes or Personal Property Taxes to the extent such Taxes were taken
into account in determining the adjustments to the Closing Cash Merger
Consideration provided for in _Section 2.8_.

(c) All Losses claimed by the Parent Indemnitees under this _Article X_ prior
to the Escrow Release Date shall be recoverable solely from the
Indemnification Escrow Account, except that Losses arising from (i) a breach
of the Fundamental Representations, (ii) a breach of the representation set
forth in _Section 4.8(c)_ ___(Financial Statements  Indebtedness)_, and
(iii) indemnification arising under _Section 10.2(a)(vi)_ or _Section
10.2(a)(vii)_, (A) prior to the Escrow Release Date shall be recoverable first
from the Indemnification Escrow Account (as it shall be reduced from time to
time to reflect payments, if any, made from time to time pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) and then directly from the Post-Escrow
Indemnifying Party (indemnifying on its own behalf and not in its capacity as
Members Representative on behalf of the Members) to the extent that such
Losses exceed the Indemnification Escrow Account and (B) subsequent to the
Escrow Release Date shall only be recoverable from the Post-Escrow
Indemnifying Party directly (indemnifying on its own behalf and not in its
capacity as Members Representative on behalf of the Members); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no case shall the aggregate maximum liability of the Post-
Escrow Indemnifying Party exceed the sum of the Merger Consideration
other than Losses incurred in connection with relating to, or arising from,
Excluded Liabilities or fraud for which the Parent Indemnitees shall be
entitled to recover the full amount of Losses incurred by the Parent
Indemnitees. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Member have
any liability to the Parent Indemnitees under this _Article X_ other than in
the case of fraud.

(d) Other than the Valuation Multiplier, which is solely applicable to
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, under no circumstances shall
any Indemnitee be entitled to be indemnified for special, consequential,
indirect, punitive or other similar damages, including lost profits, lost
revenues, diminution in value, business interruptions, or loss of business
opportunity or reputation.

 



90 (e) Other than the Valuation Multiplier, which is solely applicable to an
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, no multiplier or similar
concept shall be applied for purposes of calculating Losses. To the extent
that Parent, the Surviving LLC or any other Parent Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification under this  _Article X_ , each of them shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss which forms
the basis of an indemnification Claim hereunder (including by using such
efforts to seek reimbursement by the applicable Tenant pursuant to the
applicable Tenant Lease or to pursue a claim under any insurance policy
(including any title insurance policy) issued in favor of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary that was in effect prior to the Closing Date (or, in
the case of title insurance, acquired by the Company or a Company Subsidiary
on or after the Closing Date) or by pursuing any other third party
indemnification obligations that may be available). The amount of any Losses
suffered by an Indemnitee shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds
(including pursuant to any title insurance policy) which such party actually
receives under insurance policies in effect either prior to or following the
Closing in respect of or as a result of such Losses. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither Merger Sub, the Parent nor any current or future Subsidiary of
the Parent (including Surviving LLC) shall be required to acquire title
insurance on any Property or pursue any claim under insurance policies owned
by the Merger Sub, Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent (other than after
the Closing, the Surviving LLC or any Company Subsidiary).

(f) No Member has any individual right to assert any claims for
indemnification under this _Article X_. Any and all claims for indemnification
under this _Article X_ of the Members may be brought only by the Members
Representative (or its successor) on behalf of the Members.

(g) For purposes of this  _Article X_ , with respect to each representation
or warranty set forth in this Agreement, other than those representations and
warranties set forth (i) in the last sentence of _Section 4.1_ (
_Organization; Good Standing_ ), (ii) _Section 4.8(b)_ ( _Financial
Statements_ ), (iii) _Section 4.15_ ( _Absence of Certain Changes_ ), (iv)
_Section 4.17(g)_ ( _Other Material Contracts_ ) (and the related definition
of "Material Contract"), (v) _Section 4.27_ ( _Defects_ ), (vii) _Section
6.15_ ( _Financial Statements_ ), (viii) _Section 5.13(a)_ and _(b)_ (
_Reports and Financial Statements_ ) and (ix) the last sentence of _Section
5.13(d)_, (A) the determination of whether a breach of such representation or
warranty has occurred and (B) the calculation of Losses upon the determination
that a breach has occurred, shall be determined without regard to any
limitation or qualification as to materiality, "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" in such representation or
warranty.

 

10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) All claims for indemnification by any Indemnitee under this _ARTICLE X_
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(i) If an Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification under this _ARTICLE X_ ,
it shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing of such claim specifying
the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent
known, of the claim asserted (such notice, the " _Claims Notice_ "). Except as
provided in _Section 10.5(b)(iii)_, the failure to provide the Claims Notice
will not affect any rights hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced thereby.

 



91 (ii) If such indemnification claim involves a claim by a third party against
the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Claims Notice and upon notice to the Indemnitee, assume, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnitor, the settlement or defense thereof, _provided_
that the Indemnitee may participate in such settlement or defense, at its own
expense, through counsel chosen by it. If in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnitee, it is determined that representation by the Indemnitors
counsel of both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee is likely to present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, then the Indemnitor shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnitees counsel; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be required to pay for more than
one such counsel for all Indemnitees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
Indemnitee may take over the control of the defense or settlement of a third
party claim at any time if it irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under
this _ARTICLE X_ with respect to such claim and (ii) the Indemnitor may not,
without the consent of the Indemnitee, settle or compromise any action or
consent to the entry of any judgment, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, unless the settlement or compromise involves only the payment of
money damages by the Indemnitor and does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Indemnitee. So long as the Indemnitor is contesting
any such claim in good faith, the Indemnitee shall not pay or settle any such
claim without the Indemnitors consent. If the Indemnitor does not assume the
defense of the claim pursuant to the foregoing provisions, then, subject to 
_Section 10.4(b)_, the Indemnitee may conduct and control, through counsel of
its own choosing and at the expense of the Indemnitor, the settlement or
defense thereof, and the Indemnitor shall reasonably cooperate with it in
connection therewith. The failure of the Indemnitee to conduct or control
such defense shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any obligation it may have
hereunder. Any reasonable defense costs required to be paid by the Indemnitor
shall be paid as incurred, promptly against delivery of invoices therefor. In
the event the Indemnitor makes any payment on any indemnification claim, the
Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights
and remedies of the Indemnitee to any insurance benefits or other claims of
the Indemnitee with respect to such indemnification claim.

(iii) In the event such indemnification claim does not involve a claim by a
third party, the Indemnitee will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor
promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnitor may be
liable to the Indemnitee hereunder, which Claims Notice shall also (a) state
that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it
will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) to the extent applicable,
the date such item was paid or accrued.

(iv) The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor
(whether a direct claim or third party claim) in determining the validity of
any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such
matters, whether or not the actual payment of Losses for such Claim may be
limited by  _Section 10.3(b)_. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

 



92 (b) If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a third party claim
hereunder, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent. If the Indemnitor
has not assumed the defense of such third party claim, the Indemnitor will
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any
settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitors
prior written consent if the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.

10.5 _Other Limitations and Acknowledgements_.

 

(a) The parties agree that any indemnification payments made with respect to
this Agreement shall be treated for all tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration, unless otherwise required by law (including by a
determination of a tax authority that, under applicable law, is not subject to
further review or appeal).

 

(b) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person (i) with
respect to any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing,
(ii) for any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was included in
the calculation of the adjustment pursuant to  _Section 2.8_ (to the extent
so included), or (iii) for any Losses for which a Claims Notice was not duly
delivered prior to the applicable Indemnity Termination Date.

 

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy; Indemnification Escrow Accounts_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except in the case of (i)
actual fraud (ii) in connection with a dispute under _Section 2.8_, and (iii)
in connection with an indemnification claim under _Section 6.14(k)_, the
provisions of this _Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
parties following the Closing for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, or
any other provision of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
The parties following the Closing agree that no party hereto shall have any
other remedies or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity) for any covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or for
any statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclosure,
representations or warranties (whether written or oral), whether or not set
forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
no event shall any party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to
claim or seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are
contractual in nature and subject to this _Section 10.6_. The parties hereto
(including the Members Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholder
Members) acknowledge and agree that (i) there is not, and there has not been,
any form of confidential, special or fiduciary relationship between the Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, the Members and the
Members Representative, on the other hand, and (ii) accordingly,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto
(including the Members Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholder
Members) shall have any remedy or cause of action for equitable fraud.

 



93 (b) At any time and from time to time following the Closing, the
Members Representative (for and on behalf of the Stockholder Members) may
elect, by written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, to sell or otherwise
dispose of all or a portion of the Escrow Shares in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, subject to the limitations on resale of the Stock Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 2.12_, with the net proceeds from any
such sale remaining in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. If at any time
the Indemnification Escrow Account is comprised of both cash and Escrow
Shares, then the Stockholder Members may elect to deliver either Escrow Shares
(valued at the Average Stock Closing Price), cash or any combination of Escrow
Shares and cash, in order to satisfy any Losses pursuant to this _Article X_.

10.7 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnitor
to any Indemnitee (including pursuant to this _Article X_) in connection
with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective Affiliates, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated to and shall stand
in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect
of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such
claim or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or
demand. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnitor in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnitor, in presenting any subrogated
right, defense or claim.

97 11.13 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to any conflict of laws rules thereof that might indicate the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby
declare that it is their intention that this Agreement shall be regarded as
made under the laws of the State of Delaware and that the laws of said State
shall be applied in interpreting its provisions in all cases where legal
interpretation shall be required. Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that
this Agreement involves at least $100,000, and (b) that this Agreement has
been entered into by the parties hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del. C.
§2708\. The parties hereby further agree that New York state or United States
Federal courts sitting in New York in the borough of Manhattan shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, have exclusive jurisdiction over any action
brought against any debt financing source in connection with the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement.

11.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, each party to this Agreement (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the personal jurisdiction of the
state and federal courts of the United States of America located in the State
of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, (ii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that any
actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (iv) waives any
claim of improper venue or any claim that those courts are an inconvenient
forum and (v) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees (a)
to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the
State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware
as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service of process may also be
made on such party by prepaid certified or registered mail, and that service
made pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, have the same legal force and effect as if served
upon such party personally within the State of Delaware.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY.

(c) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE WAIVER IN _SECTION
11.14(b)_, (ii) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH

 



98  WAIVER, (iii) SUCH PARTY MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS, AGREEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN _SECTION 11.14(b)_ AND THIS
_SECTION 11.14(c)_.

11.15 _Conveyance Taxes_. Parent and the Company agree that each of Parent
and the Company will pay half of all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar
Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Company and Parent agree to jointly file all required change of
ownership and similar statements (including the Certificate of Merger).

11.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
result and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, if any party breaches this Agreement, including its obligation to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the non-
breaching party or parties shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of an injunction or
injunctions or orders for specific performance, without the proof of actual
damages, in addition to all other remedies available to the parties at law or
in equity as a remedy for any such breach. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, each party agrees to (a) cooperate fully in any attempt by the other
party or parties in obtaining any such equitable remedy, and (b) waive any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such equitable remedy. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each party
hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (i) the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. 

11.17 _Severability_. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible. 

11.18 _Members  Representative_.

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, the Members Representative
is hereby irrevocably authorized, directed and appointed to act as sole and
exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of the Members, with
full power of substitution with respect to all matters under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, including determining, giving and receiving notices
and processes hereunder and thereunder, receiving certain distributions of
the Merger Consideration to or for the benefit of the Members, executing and
delivering, for, in the name of and on behalf of the Members, any and all

 



99  documents, agreements, instruments or certificates to be executed by the
Members, in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, granting any waiver, consent,
vote or approval on behalf of the Members under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, contesting and settling any and all claims for indemnification
pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ and the Escrow Agreement, resolving any other
disputes hereunder or thereunder, performing the duties and obligations
expressly assigned to the Members Representative hereunder and thereunder,
and to engage and employ agents and representatives and to incur such other
expenses as the Members Representative shall reasonably deem necessary or
prudent in connection with the foregoing, which expenses shall be paid out of
the Members Representative Holdback Account. The Members Representative
shall have the sole and exclusive right for, in the name of and on behalf of
any Member to take any action or provide any waiver, or receive any notice
with respect to the purchase price adjustments pursuant to _Section 2.8_ and
under the Escrow Agreement, any claims for indemnification under _ARTICLE X_
and under the Escrow Agreement, and to settle any claim or controversy arising
with respect thereto. Any such actions taken, exercises of rights, power or
authority, and any decision or determination made by the Members
Representative consistent herewith, shall be absolutely and irrevocably
binding on each Member as if such Member personally had taken such action,
exercised such rights, power or authority or made such decision or
determination in such Members individual capacity, and no Members shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
foregoing Members Representatives agency may be changed solely by
the Members holding a majority of the Unit Votes (if such change is being
effected after the Closing, by the Persons who were Members holding a majority
of the Unit Votes as of immediately prior to the Closing) from time to time
upon not less than five (5) days prior written notice to Parent.

(b) The appointment of the Members Representative as each Members attorney-
in-fact revokes any power of attorney heretofore granted that authorized any
other Person or Persons to represent or act on behalf of such Member with
regard to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The appointment of the
Members Representative as attorney-in-fact pursuant hereto is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable. The obligations of each Member pursuant to
this Agreement (i) will not be terminated or otherwise affected by operation
of law, or subsequent death, mental or physical incapacity, liquidation,
dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event with respect to such
Member or any proceeding in connection therewith, or in the case of a trust,
by the death of any trustee or trustees or the termination of such trust, or
any other event, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Members of the whole or any fraction of its interest in any payment due to it
under this Agreement.

 

(c) The Members Representative hereby accepts the foregoing appointment and
agrees to serve as Members Representative, subject to the provisions hereof,
for the period of time from and after the date hereof without compensation
except for the reimbursement from the Members, in accordance with _Exhibit G_
, of fees and expenses incurred by the Members Representative in its
capacity as such. The Company and the Members Representative will, at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, direct, by joint written
notice(s) to Parent, that on the Closing Date an amount equal to FOUR HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($400,000.00) (the " _Members  Representative Holdback_"),
shall be paid directly to the Members Representative as designated in such
notice, as a fund for the fees 

 



100   and expenses of the Members Representative incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the " _Members  Representative Holdback
Account_"), with any balance of the Members Representative Holdback Account
not used for such purposes (as determined by the Members Representative in
good faith), plus any interest earned thereon, to be paid by the Members
Representative to the Members, allocable to the Members in accordance with
_Exhibit G_.

(d) For all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively
on the instructions and decisions of the Members Representative as to the
settlement of any claims for indemnification by any Parent
Indemnitee pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ and under the Escrow Agreement and the
determination of any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.8_ and under the
Escrow Agreement, or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by
the Members Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement or in
connection with any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby
or thereby.

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Members Representative shall
not, in the absence of bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence, have
any liability to the Members whatsoever with respect to its actions,
decisions and determinations, and shall be entitled to assume that all
actions, decisions and determinations are fully authorized by each and every
one of the Members.

 

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Members Representative shall
be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice,
instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being required
to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or
the propriety or validity of the service thereof. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Members Representative may act in reliance upon any
instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
Person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or
execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Members
Representative may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of
any party hereto which is an entity other than a natural person has full
power and authority to instruct the Members Representative on behalf of that
party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to the Members
Representative.

 

(g) The Members Representative may act pursuant to the advice of counsel with
respect to any matter relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not be liable for any action
taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such advice.

(h) Parent hereby agrees that the Members Representative shall not, in its
capacity as such, have any liability to Parent whatsoever with respect to its
actions, decisions or determinations. 

The rights, powers and benefits of the Members Representative under this
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



101  11.19 _Tower Aggregators_. To the Knowledge of the Company, _Schedule 11.19_
sets forth, for informational purposes only, a list of (1) each Tower Site as
to which the Company believes a tower aggregator or tower consolidator has a
beneficial or ownership interest in the real property related to such Tower
Site, and (2) the tower aggregator or tower consolidator that the Company
believes possesses such interest. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of _Schedule 11.19_. 

11.20 _Guaranty_.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Parent hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to the Company, as primary obligor and not merely as
surety, the performance of, and compliance with, all obligations, covenants,
warranties and undertakings of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement (the " _Guaranty_ "). To the extent that Merger Sub fails to pay or
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement when due, Parent shall
promptly pay to the Company the amount due or otherwise perform such
obligation without any demand or notice whatsoever. Parent hereby waives
promptness, diligence, demand, protest and notice as to the obligations and
covenants guaranteed hereby and acceptance of this Guaranty, the right to
require the Company to exhaust remedies against any other Person and waives
any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available
to, or a discharge of, Parent as a guarantor. Parent hereby waives all claims
of waiver, release, surrender, abstraction or compromise and all set-offs,
counterclaims, cross-claims, recoupments or other defenses that it may have
against the Company. Parent agrees to pay the costs and expenses in
connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty. This Guaranty shall
constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection.

(b) The obligations of Parent hereunder are unconditional and irrevocable and
will not be discharged by: (i) any modification of, or amendment or supplement
to, this Agreement; (ii) any furnishing or acceptance of security or any
exchange or release of any security; (iii) any waiver, consent or other action
or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any right, remedy or power with
respect to Merger Sub or any change in the structure of Merger Sub; (iv) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, composition, liquidation,
dissolution, or similar proceedings with respect to Merger Sub; or (v) any
other occurrence whatsoever, except performance in full of all obligations of
Merger Sub in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(c) This Guaranty shall: (i) be binding upon Parent, its successors and
assigns; (ii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Member and
its successors and assigns; and (iii) remain in full force and effect until
the performance in full of all obligations of Merger Sub and Parent set forth
in _Section 11.20(a)_.
