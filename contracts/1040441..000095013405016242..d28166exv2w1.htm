    ##### 

  

    

Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as Parent directs. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. 

   

 _Section 3.2.2 Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be subject to the consent of the Company prior to the Effective Time, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares to the Exchange Agent on a book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect 

    ##### 

  

    

such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or
the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented
thereby as contemplated by Section 3.3. 

   

 _Section 3.2.3 Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 _Section 3.2.4 Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

   

 _Section 3.2.5 No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 _Section 3.2.6 Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. If any certificate representing Company Options shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate representing Company Options to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate representing Company Options, the Option Payment, without any interest thereon.   ##### 

  

  

   

 _Section 3.2.7 Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 

   

 Section 3.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the "fair value" of such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this Section 3.3) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of fair value of a Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent notice thereof prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall have the right to participate at its own expense in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost the right to dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of the Certificates therefor, pursuant to Section 3.1. 

   

 Section 3.4 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the Exchange) and thereafter, there shall be no 

    ##### 

  

    

further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into the Merger Consideration.

Superior Proposal even if such changes were to be given effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall deliver the written notice

event, fact or circumstance relating to the Parent Group. If after fully
complying with this Section 6.5.2, Parent shall have obtained Government

other structure) devised in consultation with the applicable Governmental
Entities to obtain the requisite Government Consents to satisfy the condition
set forth in Section 7.1.3 or such that closing in the absence of
such Government Consents will not result in a violation of Law. 

   

 _Section 6.5.3 _The Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, if applicable, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, _provided, however,_ that Parent shall not be responsible for any delay in the filing dates required by Section 6.5.2 due to any review by the Company.

to, consult with the others in advance of any meeting or conference with a
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a Third Party,
with any other Person, relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, to the extent permitted by such applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Parties the opportunity

of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to
any such legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in

sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to it or any of its
Affiliates ability to retain, any of its businesses, properties or
assets. Furthermore, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall
agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit

 _Section 6.8.2 Obligations with Respect to Continuing Employees_. Parent hereby agrees that, for the period immediately following the Effective Time through and including the later of (x) December 31, 2006 and (y) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time (such date, the " _Employment Benefit Plan Extension Date_ "), it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide each Continuing Employee (other than a Continuing Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are established through collective bargaining with a labor organization) with at least the same level of base salary and wages and on substantially the same terms and conditions as was provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) except with respect to Continuing Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are established through collective bargaining with a labor organization, maintain Surviving Corporation Benefit Plans (except to the extent any such plan provides equity-based compensation or traditional non-qualified deferred compensation benefits) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and disclosed in Section 4.10.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (determined without regard to any modifications to such plans made pursuant to this Agreement);  _provided, however,_ that in the event the cost of health and welfare benefits incurred by the Surviving Corporation and its 

    ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) increases, or can reasonably be expected to
increase, by more than fifteen (15) percent in one year (a " _Material Benefit
Cost Increase_ "), the Surviving Corporation may take such action as may be
reasonably necessary (such as increasing co-payment obligations or deductible
thresholds) to limit the year-to-year increase in the cost of health and
welfare benefits to a level that does not constitute a Material Benefit Cost
Increase;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not obligate
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to employ one or more of the Continuing
Employees. Subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.1, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms
(including, without limitation, terms which provide for amendment or
termination) all contracts, agreements, arrangements, programs, policies,
plans and commitments of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (and prior to any
modifications made pursuant to this Agreement) and disclosed in Section
4.10.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are applicable to any current
or former employees or directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
including without limitation the severance plans and policies adopted by the
Company Board, except for any payments or modifications set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however,_ that except for contractual obligations
which survive beyond the Employee Benefit Plan Extension Date, obligations of
Parent set forth in this sentence shall terminate on the Employee Benefit Plan
Extension Date. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any Continuing Employee, or to restrict the right of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to terminate any
Continuing Employee. 

   

 _Section 6.8.3 Credit for Service_. Continuing Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits) under any Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan under which each Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. 

   

 _Section 6.8.4 Welfare Plans_. With respect to any Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement (a " _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan_ ") 

    ##### 

  

 

and in which a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive, or use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing,
waiting period or actively-at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee
under such Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) provide credit to each Continuing
Employee (and his/her beneficiaries) for any co-payments, deductibles and

shall cause Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor,

specific awards or payments identified by Parent, any one or more of the
following: (i) outstanding bonus awards under the 1998 Annual Incentive

benefits under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan; and (vi) benefits
under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (including the Retirement
Enhancement Program); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the case of any
unfunded obligations requested to be accelerated by Parent, the Company shall
be entitled to advance funds, or provide other adequate security upon terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Company and Parent, from Parent as the
Company determines may be necessary to make such accelerated payments

Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall also advance costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) as incurred by any Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking in customary form, consistent with the practices of the Company prior to the Effective Time, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification (it being understood that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not require any security for such undertaking). 

   

 _Section 6.9.3 _For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (the " _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the DandO Insurance (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with respect to the coverage, deductible and amounts no less favorable than those of the DandO

Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) in satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.9.3, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of three hundred (300) percent of the amount
currently paid by the Company (which premiums are set forth in Section 6.9.3
of the Company Disclosure Schedule), it being understood and agreed that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide the maximum amount of such coverage as may be obtained for such
annual three hundred (300) percent amount and (ii) in the event of the
application of clause (i), any present or former officer or director, upon
reasonable written notice thereof (which notice shall be provided no later
than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time and shall set forth in
reasonable detail for each Person to be covered the policy coverage,
premiums, deductibles, limitations and other pertinent information), who
desires to obtain additional coverage such that, when combined with the
coverage obtained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
clause (i), it provides insurance coverage equivalent to the DandO Insurance
in effect on the date hereof, may so elect and Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to acquire such additional coverage on behalf of
such Person; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event any present or former
officer or director makes such an election, such former officer or
director shall pay the portion of the premium of such DandO Insurance in excess
of the amount which Parent or the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay
pursuant to this Section 6.9. The insurance purchased pursuant to this
Section 6.9 shall be prepaid in full at the Effective Time (or at such time
as it is actually obtained) and shall be non-cancelable. At the request of the
Company, Parent shall arrange for such insurance prior to the Effective Time
to be effective only at and after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
Parent shall pay in full for such insurance coverage no later than the
Effective Time. The Company may acquire a six (6) year tail policy for
Persons currently covered by DandO Insurance that is consistent with the first
sentence of this Section 6.9.3 so long as the one time premium payment for
such tail policy is not more than three hundred (300) percent of the amount
currently paid by the Company on an annual basis and as set forth in
Section 6.9.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such policy shall be
prepaid at the Effective Time and shall be non-cancelable. If the Company
acquires such a tail policy, Parents obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.9.3 shall be deemed completely satisfied. The
obligation to maintain insurance provided in this Section 6.9.3 

    ##### 

  

 

shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in the event any
claim or claims are asserted or made within such six (6) year period, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that such insurance remains in full
force and effect with respect to such claims until final
disposition thereof. 

   

 _Section 6.9.4 _If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or acquiror of such assets), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.9.

 Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares of Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Not later than 30 days following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause to be delivered to the Company an opinion from Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin, or such other nationally recognized accounting or investment banking firm as the Company may reasonably approve, valuing the Company as a going-concern (including goodwill), on a pro forma basis, immediately after and giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Commitments, and opining that, assuming, in each case, the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Commitments had been consummated as proposed, immediately after and giving effect to such transactions on a pro forma basis, (i) the fair value and present fair saleable value to the Companys assets would exceed the Companys stated liabilities and identified contingent liabilities; (ii) the Company should be able to pay its debts as they become absolute and mature; and (iii) the capital remaining in the Company after the transactions contemplated hereby would not be unreasonably small for the business in which the Company is engaged, as management has indicated it is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted by Parent following the consummation of such transactions, and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, addressed to the Company Board, supporting the conclusion that, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be solvent (or the equivalent thereof, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Company) (such opinion, the " _Solvency Opinion_ "). Parent shall obtain a "bring down" of the Solvency Opinion dated as of the Closing Date, which opinion shall be in form and substance no less favorable to the Company than the Solvency Opinion, _provided_ , that any assumptions contained 

   ##### 

  

    

in the Solvency Opinion as to which facts have been ascertained between the
date of the original Solvency Opinion and the Closing Date shall be
eliminated. Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection therewith,
use their commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) make available their
respective officers, agents and other Representatives on a customary basis
and upon reasonable notice and (ii) provide or make available such
information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Company as may reasonably be requested in connection with
delivering such a "bring down" of the Solvency Opinion. Following the
Effective Time and until the earlier to occur of six (6) years thereafter or
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, Parent shall not
take or fail to take any action that if such action had been deemed to have
been taken or such failure to act had been deemed to have occurred
immediately prior to the Effective Time would have caused the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.12 hereof to be untrue as of the date
hereof or as of the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 6.13 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each officer
and director of the Company, each holder of Company Common Stock and each of
their respective successors, heirs and personal representatives. 

  

 Section 6.14 _Financing_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to complete the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters (including obtaining rating agency approvals, maintaining in effect the Commitments, satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to SBEV, Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the financing contemplated by the Commitments (including by consummating the financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter(s)), negotiating definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein, satisfying all conditions applicable to SBEV, Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within its control and, if necessary, borrowing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters in the event the "flex" provisions are exercised), with such changes as Parent may desire, in order to have available to it the Merger Consideration and other transaction costs at or prior to the Closing; _provided, however,_ that in no event will Parent make any changes that would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the Company upon the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , that, except as expressly provided in the following sentence, such changes must be approved in writing by 

   ##### 

  

    

the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to comply with the terms of, and satisfy the
conditions contemplated by, the financing contemplated by the Commitments in
accordance with this Section 6.14 and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Commitments without obtaining the prior written consent of the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, provided the consent of
the Company shall not be required in the event that any such amendment or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letters (A) does not have and could not
reasonably be expected to have any adverse effect on the "bring down" of the
Solvency Opinion or Parents ability to deliver such "bring down" to the
Company and the Company Board as required by Section 6.13 hereof, and (B)
involves solely one or more of the following: (1) a change in the participant
Institutional Lenders, provided that any such substituted participant shall
be a bank or private lender with assets exceeding $1 billion; (2) the removal
or limitation of contingencies or conditions to the obligations of
the Institutional Lenders thereunder; (3) the shifting between or among
Institutional Lenders of their respective lending obligations to Parent and
its affiliates participating directly or indirectly in the contribution of
Merger Consideration; and (4) increases in the overall indebtedness by no
more than $100,000,000 in the aggregate. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material breach by any party of the Commitments or any
termination of any of the Commitments. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the updated Debt
Commitment Letters referred to in Section 6.2.1 hereof to be delivered as
promptly as is reasonably practicable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
financing provided for by the Commitments has not been or cannot be obtained,
Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Merger
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of
this Agreement and to Parents rights under Section 8.1, regardless of
whether Parent and Merger Sub have complied with all of their other
obligations under this Agreement (including their obligations under this
Section 6.14). 

  

 Section 6.15 _Cooperation in Securing Financing_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in connection with obtaining the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment

Letters, in (i) supplying to the Institutional Lender or Lenders and equity
participants all agreements, documents, instruments, reports, financial
information and statements, and other information regarding the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, the Company Properties, the Company Health Care
Businesses and the other activities of or related to any of the foregoing in
each case as reasonably requested by them, (ii) attempting to respond to
reasonable questions raised by Institutional Lenders and equity participants,
and (iii) permitting reasonable access to the Company Properties during
normal business hours and with reasonable notice; _provided_ , that the
provision of information to Institutional Lenders and equity participants

_provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no officer
or director of the Company shall be required to execute any documents,
including, without limitation, any registration statement to be filed with
the SEC, any pledge or security documents or other definitive financing
documents and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the financing contemplated by the Commitments
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the financing contemplated by the Commitments and any information utilized in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition
set forth in Section 7.2.2 of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys
obligations under this Section 6.15, shall be deemed satisfied unless the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters has not been obtained
as a result of the Companys willful and material breach of its
obligations under this Section 6.15. All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries obtained by
Parent or the Parent Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be
kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

then, in such event, Parent shall pay the Company the Business Interruption
Fee, which amount in any case shall not be subject to offset or deduction of
any kind, except in the event of (iii), if the Company has retained the

    ##### 

  

 

resulting from termination of this Agreement under the circumstances where a
Business Interruption Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5.1 are
reasonable forecasts of the actual damages that may be incurred and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Parent fails to promptly pay the Business Interruption Fee, and, in order to
obtain such payment the company commences a suit which results in a
judgment against Parent for the Business Interruption Fee, Parent shall pay
to the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit.

Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 Section 8.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, after approval of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders.
