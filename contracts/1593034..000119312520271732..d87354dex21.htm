ARTICLE II

_THE OFFER _

2.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been validly terminated pursuant to _ Article_ __ _ IX_, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter), Merger Sub shall (and Parent

 



18

    

 shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and
all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price per Company Share, subject
to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, equal to the Offer Price. The Offer
shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
that is disseminated to all of the Company Stockholders and contains the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in _ Annex_ __ _ A_. The
obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
irrevocably accept for payment and pay for any Company Shares validly tendered
(and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to:

 

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, as of immediately prior
to the Expiration Time, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, and "received" by the "depository" for
the Offer (as such terms are defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL), a number
of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned by
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (if any), represents at
least a majority of all then outstanding Company Shares on a fully diluted
basis; and

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_.

 

(b) _Waiver of Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (but is
not obligated to) at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion to
waive, in whole or in part, any conditions to the Offer and to make any change
or modification to the terms of or conditions to the Offer (including
increasing the Offer Price); _ provided_,  _however,_ __ that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (and
Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to) (i) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, the Termination Condition (as defined in _Annex A_ ), the condition
set forth in clause (A) of _Annex A_ , or the condition set forth in clause
(C)(1) of _ Annex_ __ _ A_, or (ii) make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be paid
in the Offer, (B) decreases the Offer Price (other than as required under
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_) or the number of Company Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer or the Expiration Time, except
as permitted or required by _Section 2.1(d)_, (D) imposes conditions to the
Offer other than those set forth in _ Annex A_ or (E) amends any term or
condition of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect, the Company Stockholders (subject to any
right or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to extend the Offer as permitted
or required by _Section 2.1_(d)).

(c) _Adjustments to the Offer Price_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
the Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
similar change with respect to Company Shares or securities convertible into
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock,
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time, so as
to provide any Company Stockholder the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that in any case, nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 



19

    

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall be scheduled to expire at one minute following
11:59 p.m., New York time, on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) (such date and time, subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, the " _Expiration Time_ "). In the event that the Offer is extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall
expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)(i)_ or anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms:

 

(A) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any
Law or Order, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff or NASDAQ, or as may be necessary to resolve any comments of the
SEC or its staff or NASDAQ, in any such case that is applicable to the Offer;

 

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex_
__ _ A_, other than the Minimum Condition, are not satisfied or waived (if
permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, Merger
Sub may (and, if requested by the Company, shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for one (1) or more successive extension
periods of up to fifteen (15) Business Days each (or any longer period as may
be approved in advance by the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of
all of the conditions to the Offer; and

 

(C) in the event that the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, as of any
then scheduled expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may (and, if requested by
the Company, shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for
one or more successive extensions of ten (10) Business Days each (or any
longer period as may be approved in advance by the Company), it
being understood and agreed that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer pursuant to this clause (C) on more than three (3) occasions, but
may, in its sole discretion, elect to do so;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or
otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Article_ __ _ IX_
and (y) in no event shall Merger Sub be required (and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub) to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date.

(iii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall extend the Offer in any manner
other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.1(d)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _ Article_ __ _ IX_, in which case
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one
(1) Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

 



20

    

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Parent or Merger Sub extend the Offer beyond the Termination
Date without the prior written consent of the Company.

(vi) If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement
is validly terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_ prior to the
Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
promptly return or cause to be returned all tendered Company Shares to the
registered holders thereof in accordance with applicable Law.

(e) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to), at or as promptly as practicable following the
Expiration Time (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.1(d)(ii)_), but in any event within one (1) Business Day thereof,
irrevocably accept for payment, and, promptly following the Acceptance Time,
but in any event within three (3) Business Days, pay for, all Company Shares
that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer;
_provided_ that with respect to Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee, Merger Sub shall be under no obligation to
make any payment for such Company Shares unless and until such Company Shares
are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any
Company Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer and this Agreement. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company
Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid
net to the holder thereof, in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable

Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable

the information regarding Parent and Merger Sub and their respective

14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company Stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws, or by the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ. Unless the Company
Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, and except in
connection with any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
or any committee thereof to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent, Merger Sub and their

writing to Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel any and all written comments

14D-9 promptly after such receipt, and unless the Company Board has effected a
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity (x) to review and comment on
any such responses, which comments the Company shall consider reasonably and
in good faith and (y) to the extent reasonably practicable, participate in any
material discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such comments
and/or responses. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the determinations and approvals of the Company Board set forth in the
final sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ and the Company Board Recommendation.

date of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter as reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub, the Company shall, or shall cause its
transfer agent to, furnish Parent and Merger Sub with a list, as of the most
recent practicable date (which shall not be more than ten (10) Business Days 

 



23

    

 prior to the date the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated), of the Company Stockholders, mailing labels and any available
listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of all record

Company Shares held in stock depositories (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels, listings or files of securities positions) and
such other information and assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the Company Stockholders. Subject to applicable
Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent
and Merger Sub (and their respective agents) shall (A) hold in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in
any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of
securities positions and (B) use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement.

Offer and immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Canceled Company Shares_
") or (B) irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer ("
_Accepted Company Shares_ "), shall, in each case, be canceled and cease to
exist without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor at the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt and without duplication, any consideration that remains payable with
respect to any such Accepted Company Shares pursuant to the Offer).

 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which shall
constitute the only outstanding share of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time.

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration and the RSU
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
similar change with respect to Company Shares or securities convertible into
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock,
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, so as
to provide any Company Stockholder and any holder of Company Options or
Company RSU Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; _provided_ , that in any case, nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 3.7(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who are entitled to demand and
have properly and validly demanded their statutory rights of appraisal in
respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all respects with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ "), shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Company Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist, and the holders of
Dissenting Company Shares shall only be entitled to the

 



26

    

 rights granted to them under the DGCL. Holders of Dissenting Company Shares
will be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost their
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262
of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and
shall thereupon be deemed as of the Effective Time to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and less any applicable
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_, upon surrender of such
Company Shares in the manner provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise, any
such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(d) _Company Options_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
or the Company, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested) shall be
surrendered and canceled and, as of the Effective Time, converted into the
right to receive, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash
(without interest), equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the
aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the amount, if any, by which the Offer
Price exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). No Option Consideration shall be payable with
respect to any Company Option so canceled with a per share exercise price that
equals or exceeds the amount of the Offer Price. Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to,
pay through Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the applicable
Subsidiarys payroll to the former holders of Company Options, the applicable
Option Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (and in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days thereafter).

 

(e) _Company RSU Awards_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof
or the Company, each Company RSU Award (whether vested or unvested) that
remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
fully vested (to the extent unvested) and, as of the Effective Time,
be converted into the right to receive, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_,
an amount in cash (without interest), equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying
such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the
Offer Price (the " _RSU_ __ _ Consideration_"). Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to,
pay through Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the applicable
Subsidiarys payroll to the former holders of Company RSU Awards, the
applicable RSU Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes payable
in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (and in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter).

 



27

    

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any amounts payable
under this  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ relate to a Company RSU Award that is
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or is
subject to any agreement, plan or arrangement that requires any delay in
payment of such amounts beyond the time period provided by this _Section_ __
_ 3.7_, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary shall
pay such amounts at the earliest time, as applicable, permitted under the
terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such
Company RSU Award and that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code (after taking into account actions taken under Treas. Reg.
1-409A-3(j)(4)(ix)), but no earlier than as promptly as is practicable
following such time (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
such time).

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the Company Compensation
Committee, as applicable, shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be necessary to effect the treatment of the Company Options and
Company RSU Awards pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.7_. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to, as of the Effective Time, ensure that from and
after the Effective Time neither Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares to any Person pursuant
to or in settlement of Company Options or Company RSU Awards.

 

3.8 _Payment for Company Securities; Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate and
appoint a nationally recognized, reputable U.S. bank or trust company (the
identity of which shall be subject to the reasonable prior approval of the
Company) to act as depository agent for the Company Stockholders entitled to
receive the Offer Price pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ and as the
paying agent for the Company Stockholders entitled to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_ (the " _Paying Agent_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for payment to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which the
Company Stockholders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as reasonably
directed by Parent (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.8(g)_. No investment or losses thereon shall affect
the consideration to which the Company Stockholders are entitled under this
_Article_ __ _ III_ and to the extent that there are any losses with respect
to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
any reason below the amount required to promptly pay in full the cash amounts
contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ III_, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such payments contemplated by
this _Article_ __ _ III_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than as expressly provided in this Agreement.



 



28

    

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii) non-
certificated Company Shares represented in book-entry form (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, whose Company Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably satisfactory to
the Company and Parent, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_. Upon surrender of Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number
of Company Shares represented by such Certificate that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, 
_by_ (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Tax
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_), and the Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.7_, _by_ (2) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_), and the
Uncertificated Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. The Paying
Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry held
through the Depository Trust Company shall be required to deliver a letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7_. In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated Shares held
through the Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.7_, as applicable, shall automatically upon the Effective Time, be entitled
to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to the
Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event within one (1) Business Day thereof) an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the
aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such Uncertificated Shares
held through the Depository Trust Company that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, _by_
(y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_), and such Uncertificated Shares of such holder shall
be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates and Uncertificated

 



29

    

 Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.8_.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
(other than Certificates and Uncertificated Shares representing any Canceled
Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding Tax
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(e)_, payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of this  _Article_ __ _ III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid any transfer Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for any such Taxes in the
circumstances described in this _Section_ __ _ 3.8(d)_. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Uncertificated Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name the Uncertificated Shares are
registered.

 

(e) _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain any affidavits, certificates
and other documents as may reasonably be expected to afford to the Company
and its stockholders reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld,
each such payor shall take all reasonable action as may be necessary to
ensure any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. Any amounts deducted and withheld under
this Agreement shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid and Parent shall or shall cause its Subsidiary to take all commercially
reasonable efforts to timely and properly remit such amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Authority.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Shares at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the property of
the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



30

    

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto)
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent, upon demand, and any Company Stockholders who have not
theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing such Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger
Consideration, payable in respect of the Company Shares formerly represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_.

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after
the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and (a) each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share representing any Company Shares (other
than Dissenting Company Shares or Canceled Company Shares) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ (or, for the avoidance of doubt and
without duplication, any consideration that remains payable with respect to
any Accepted Company Shares pursuant to the Offer), (b) each holder of any
Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights specified in _Section_ __ _ 3.7(c)_ and (c) each
holder of any Canceled Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto. The Merger Consideration or the consideration specified in
_Section_ __ _ 3.7(c)_, as applicable, paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_.

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of a customary affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, in the form and substance as reasonably
requested by the Paying Agent, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require
the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
customary indemnity (which may include the posting of a bond in a reasonable
amount) against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the
Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under, or duty or
obligation

 



31

    

 with respect to, any of the property, rights, privileges, powers or
franchises, or any of the debts or Liabilities, of the Company as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of
this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assumptions
and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or
desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under, or duty or obligation with
respect to, such property, rights, privileges, powers or franchises, or any
such debts or Liabilities, in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry
out the intent of this Agreement.

Except as disclosed in (i) the letter delivered by the Company to Parent and
Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_
") or (ii) any Company SEC Report filed with or furnished to the SEC since
January 1, 2018 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (excluding any

cautionary or forward-looking in nature)); _provided_ that this clause (ii)
shall not be applicable to  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, _Section_ __ _ 4.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.4_, _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.26_, the

standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization (to the extent such concepts are recognized in the applicable
jurisdiction), with all corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as currently
conducted, except for such failures to be in good standing or have such power
that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other entity authorized to do business in each of the
jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under
lease by it or the nature or conduct of the business transacted by it makes
such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified and
in good standing that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
similar governing documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in

the Capitalization Date in accordance with their terms. All of the outstanding
Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid

the Code) of a Company Share on the date of grant and (ii) each Company Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code so qualifies. Each Company Option and Company RSU Award may by its terms
be treated at the Effective Time as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_.

(d) Except for the Company Options and the Company RSU Awards referenced in
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_ above, there are no outstanding
(i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities or ownership
interests in the Company, (ii) options, warrants, rights or other agreements,
arrangements or commitments requiring the Company to issue, or other
obligations of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or
other ownership interests in, or securities convertible into or exchangeable

33

    

(e) There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities.
There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
capital stock of the Company. All outstanding securities of the Company have
been offered and issued in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable securities Laws, including the Securities Act and "blue sky" Laws.

 

(f) The Company or another of its Subsidiaries is the record and beneficial
owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens), which shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are free of
preemptive rights, and there are no irrevocable proxies with respect to any
such shares. As of the date hereof, with respect to each Subsidiary of the
Company, there are no securities, options, warrants, rights or other
agreements or commitments or obligations, in each case of the type described
in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Company Securities, with
respect to any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests
in any Subsidiary of the Company (together with the shares of capital stock
of the Subsidiaries of the Company, the " _Subsidiary Securities_ ").

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other similar obligations, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the Company Stockholders on any matter.

(h) No Company Shares are held by any Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(i) The Company has taken all actions necessary to (i) render the Company
Stockholders Right Plan inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) ensure that in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (A) neither Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their "Affiliates" or "Associates" (each as defined in the Company
Stockholders Rights Plan) is or will be (1) a "Beneficial Owner" of or deemed
to "beneficially own" and have "Beneficial Ownership" (each as defined in the
Company Stockholders Rights Plan) of any securities of the Company or (2) an
"Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) and
(B) none of a "Shares Acquisition Date," a "Distribution Date" (as such terms
are defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) or a "Triggering Event"
(as defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) occurs or will occur, in
each case of clauses (A) and (B), solely by reason of the execution of this
Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger, the Offer, or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) provide that the "Final
Expiration Date" (as defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) shall
occur immediately prior to the Effective Time, but only if the Effective Time
shall occur. To the Companys Knowledge, no Person is an "Acquiring Person"
and no "Share Acquisition Date," "Distribution Date" (as such terms are
defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) or "Triggering Event" (as
defined in the Company Stockholders Rights Plan) has occurred. The Company
Stockholders Rights Plan has not been amended or modified.

 



34

    

4.3 _Subsidiaries_. _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true, correct and complete list of each Subsidiary of the
Company, including its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and the
percentage of the outstanding equity interests of each such Subsidiary owned
by the Company and each of the other Subsidiaries of the Company. Except for
the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other
equity or voting interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or
exchangeable for any of the foregoing, any Person.

Confidentiality Agreement with such Person, (B) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such

qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9

Proposal or any material modification thereto has been made public, fail to
issue a press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation upon
request of Parent within five (5) Business Days after Parent requests such
reaffirmation (or, if earlier, prior to the anticipated Expiration Time), (v)
following the commencement of any tender or exchange offer relating to the

may (i) in response to the receipt of a written, _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal received after the date hereof that did not result from a
material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or, (ii) in response to the receipt of a written, _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not result from a
material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such applicable Acquisition Proposal and terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_; _provided_ that (A) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after

 



64

    

 consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the
Company provides written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ of its intent to take such
action, specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail (a " _Change of
Recommendation/Termination Notice_ "), including the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including a copy of all definitive
agreements and documentation in respect thereof), (D) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) during such five (5) Business Day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (E) no earlier
than the end of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and
outside legal counsel), after taking into account any revised terms agreed to
in writing by Parent during such five (5) Business Day period, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Following delivery of a Change of
Recommendation/Termination Notice in the event of any change to the financial
terms (including any change to the amount or form of consideration payable) or
other material revision to the terms or conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall provide a new Change of
Recommendation/Termination Notice to Parent, and any Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ following delivery of such new Change
of Recommendation/Termination Notice shall again be subject to clauses (C)
through (E) of the immediately preceding sentence, except that references to
five (5) Business Days shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, upon
the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , __ that (i) the Company provides written notice to Parent at
least five (5) Business Days prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation
Change of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons thereof in
reasonable detail (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ "), including reasonably
detailed information describing the Intervening Event (including all
documentation in respect thereof, if any), (ii) prior to effecting such a
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) during such five (5) Business Day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that a failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event would no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (iii) no earlier than the end of such five (5) Business Day
period, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel), after taking into
account any revised terms agreed to in writing by Parent during such five (5)
Business Day period, that failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event 

 



65

    

 would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Following delivery of an Intervening Event Notice in the event of a material
change in any Effect relating to such Intervening Event, the Company shall
provide a new Intervening Event Notice to Parent, and any Company Board
Recommendation Change following delivery of such new Intervening Event Notice
shall again be subject to clauses (ii) through (iv) of the immediately
preceding sentence, except that references to five (5) Business Days shall be
deemed to be three (3) Business Days.

disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule

promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company
Board Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _
6.3(c)_ or  _Section 6.3(d)_.

Affiliates shall be required to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect any

material to the business, assets or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) be materially detrimental to the
benefits Parent and its Affiliates expect as a result of the Offer or the
Merger, or (II) with respect to the operations, businesses or assets of

and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or shall cause its Affiliates
or Representatives to issue) any public release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such release or announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of NASDAQ or any other applicable stock exchange to which Parent
is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party
or parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing
of any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made
or proposed to be made by any party with respect to a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to any "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board or any committee thereof to the Company Stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, further_ ,
that the parties shall not be required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ to provide

separate approval shall be required in respect of such content to the extent
replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent press release or other public
announcement, and (b) each party may, without complying with the foregoing

press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the
parties or approved by the parties, and otherwise in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

 

7.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,

action as necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

promptly to Parent all information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, including
with respect to the Company Programs, to the extent reasonably available, and
keep Parent reasonably apprised as to any material developments with respect

restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that (A) any applicable Law requires the Company or its Subsidiaries
to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information or
(B) the Company in good faith determines access to such documents or
information would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information, or (C) such documents or
information relate to the evaluation or negotiation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or, subject to _Sections_ _6.2_ and _6.3_ ,
an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal. In the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on clauses (A) or (B) of
the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate any applicable Law or waive such a privilege. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_
shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 7.6_. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries

analyses, appraisals or opinions that are not readily available.

7.7 _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_ __ _ Exemption_. Prior to or as of the
Acceptance Time, the Company and the Company Board shall take all actions

Agreement by any director or executive officer of the Company who is a covered
Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time

and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time that are no less favorable than the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions contained in the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six (6)
year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as required
by applicable Law or as provided below.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section_ __ _
7.8(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any
threatened or actual action, suit, claim, proceeding, investigation,
arbitration or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (each an " _Indemnified Proceeding_ "), to the extent such
Indemnified Proceeding arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains
directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (including as a fiduciary with respect to any employment benefit
plan) or by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was serving
at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as such (including as a
fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit plan) of another Person (in
each case with respect to actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions
that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, during the period

the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final
disposition of any Indemnified Proceeding for which indemnification may be
sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified
Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with any such Indemnified Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided
in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Surviving Corporation shall procure and purchase, as of the Effective Time, a
six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Person during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance policy or, if insurance
coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the DandO Tail Policy is not
available at an aggregate cost not greater than 300% of the aggregate annual
cost most recently paid by the Company prior

 



71

    

 to the date of this Agreement, then, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as can be obtained at an aggregate cost up
to but not exceeding the amount set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.8(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person
notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has been made against
such Indemnified Person, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation until the final disposition thereof.

 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation expressly assume all of the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

(f) This _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons
and their respective heirs and legal representatives, and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Person without the written consent of such affected Indemnified Person. The
rights provided under this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Person is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

7.9 _Company 401(k) Plan(s_ _); Bonus Plan._ __

 

(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate each Company
Plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code and contains a
qualified cash or deferred feature under Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ "), or cause such plan(s) to be terminated, effective
as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "
_401(k) Plan Termination Date_ "), and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing, and provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan(s) shall
become fully vested in any unvested portion of their Company 401(k) Plan
accounts as of the 401(k) Plan Termination Date. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan
has been terminated (effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing
Date and contingent on the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior
review and comment by Parent.

(b) If the Closing occurs before the date on which annual bonuses for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 are to be paid by the Company under any
Plan that is an annual cash incentive compensation plan or arrangement (each,
a " _2020 Bonus Plan_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each

 



72

    

 employee who continues employment with Parent, its Subsidiary or the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Closing (a " _Continuing Employee_
") participating in a 2020 Bonus Plan the annual bonuses under each 2020
Bonus Plan equal to the amount set forth opposite each such Continuing
Employees name on _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the " _2020 Bonuses_ "). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay through
Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the applicable Subsidiarys payroll
to such Continuing Employees, the 2020 Bonuses, less any required withholding
Taxes payable in respect thereof, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter).

 

7.10 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement before and after the Effective Time, as applicable (including, with
respect to Merger Sub, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement). 

7.11 _Company Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any Legal Proceeding commenced after the date hereof against the
Company and/or any of its directors or officers (in each case, in their
capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on
behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed regarding any such Legal Proceeding. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to (a) participate in (but not control) the defense or
settlement of any such Legal Proceeding and (b) review and comment on all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in the defense of
settlement of such Legal Proceeding. The Company may not enter into any
settlement agreement in respect of such Legal Proceeding against the Company
and/or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby without Parents prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

7.12 _Certain_ _Other Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the
Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ , (a) take the actions set forth on _Section 7.12(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure and (b) take the actions set forth on _Section 7.12(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure.

 

7.13 _Delisting_. Parent shall cause (and the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent to cause) the Company Shares to be de-listed from NASDAQ
and de-registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time.

 

7.14 _14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company Compensation
Committee shall have taken all steps as may be necessary to (a) approve as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement any agreement, plan, program, arrangement
or understanding entered into or established by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with or on behalf of its officers, directors or employees, in
each case, at or prior to the Expiration Time, including any amendment or
modification thereto, and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act with respect to such
agreement, plan, program, arrangement or understanding.

 



73

    

7.15 _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, (a) of any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Person alleging that
the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such Consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or (b) if it obtains Knowledge
of any breach by such party of its representations, warranties and covenants
hereunder that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to lead to the failure of any condition to the other partys obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ shall
not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of
such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to any party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions to the Offer (or cause any such conditions to
fail to be satisfied) or give rise to any right of Parent to terminate under
_Article_ __ _ IX_. The Company will also notify and keep Parent reasonably
apprised of communications it receives from, or discussions it has with, any
Company Stockholder, if such communications or discussions are likely to be
material to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time.

under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.8(d)_,

interest on the amount payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date
of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. The payment by the
Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, and, if

and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub in the event of termination of

Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
the termination thereof or any matter forming the basis for such
termination), including the Offer and the Merger; _provided, however_ , that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_ shall limit the rights or remedies of

not be amended in any manner that causes the Merger Consideration to differ
from the Offer Price.

 

9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto (it being agreed that any
extension or waiver by Parent also shall be an effective extension or waiver

otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other party or parties hereto, as
applicable, (b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties made to
such party or parties hereto contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements,
covenants or conditions for the benefit of such party or parties hereto
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties hereto to
any such extension or waiver (it being agreed that any agreement to an
extension or waiver by Parent also shall be an effective extension or waiver
by Merger Sub) shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of

either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties, except that
Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement will be void _ab initio_.

10.4  _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2020 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect

validly terminated by the parties thereto; _provided_ that the Company hereby
waives the obligations of Parent and its Affiliates under any explicit or
implicit "standstill" provisions therein with respect to any actions taken in
furtherance of or to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



79

    

10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any schedules, annexes
and exhibits hereto) and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annexes hereto, and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 

10.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms
and provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ (with respect to which the Indemnified
Persons shall be third party beneficiaries), (b) the right of the Company, on
behalf of the Company Stockholders to pursue damages in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement in the event of Parents, or Merger Subs breach
of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that this clause (b) is not intended, and
under no circumstances shall be deemed to create any right of the
Company Stockholders or the holders of Company Options or Company RSU Awards
to bring an action against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise), (c) from and after the Acceptance Time, the rights of the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the Offer to receive the Offer Price, as provided in
_Article_ __ _ II_ and in accordance with the Offer, and (d) from and after
the Effective Time, the rights of Company Stockholders and the holders of
other Company Securities to receive the Merger Consideration, Option
Consideration or RSU Consideration, as applicable, as provided in _Article_ __
_ III_.

 

10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any term or other provision (or part
thereof) of this Agreement, or the application thereof, is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions (or parts thereof) of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
(or part thereof) is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and in a mutually acceptable
manner in order for the transactions contemplated hereby to be effected as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

10.8 _Remedies_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



80

    

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that no adequate remedy at
Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine. Accordingly, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of
any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
shall be entitled (without proof of actual damages or otherwise or posting or
securing any bond) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under
this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled to at law or in equity. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree not to oppose the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance on the basis that the other party has
an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including any claims or causes of
action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
