<PAGE>


reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in

of the expenses Seller would have otherwise incurred if such separation
activities were not necessary. From time to time, whether before, at or
following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquittances and such other
instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be necessary or
appropriate to assure fully to Buyer and its successors or assigns, all of the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements and to assure fully to Seller and its Affiliates, and
their respective successors and assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and
obligations intended to be assumed by Buyer under this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements, and to otherwise make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including (i)
transferring back to Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary any asset or
liability not contemplated by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an
Assumed Liability, respectively, which asset or liability was transferred to
Buyer at the Closing and (ii) transferring to Buyer any asset or liability
contemplated by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an Assumed
Liability, respectively, which asset or liability was not transferred to Buyer
at the Closing).

               (c) Nothing in this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
construed as an attempt or agreement to assign any Purchased Asset, including
any Contract, Third-Party Lease, License, Business Record, Governmental
Permit, certificate, approval, authorization or other right, that by its terms
or by Law is not capable of being sold, assigned, licensed, sublicensed,
transferred, delivered or subleased without the consent or waiver of a Third
Party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable, in whole or material part, by
such Person in the event of any such sale, assignment, license, sublicense,
transfer, delivery or sublease ("Nonassignable Assets") unless and until such
consent or waiver shall be given. Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents and waivers
promptly and resolve the impediments to the sale, assignment, license,
sublicense, transfer, delivery or sublease required by this Agreement or the
Collateral Agreements and obtain any other consents and waivers necessary or
advisable to convey to Buyer any of the Purchased Assets; provided, however,
that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to make any
payment to obtain any such consent or waiver with respect to any Nonassignable
Asset. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a payment should be made to
obtain a consent or waiver with respect to any Nonassignable Asset, Seller and
Buyer shall bear the expense of such payment equally. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the consents
and waivers referred to in the preceding sentence are not obtained by Seller,
or until the impediments to the sale, assignment, license, sublicense,
transfer, delivery or sublease referred to therein are resolved, Seller shall
(and shall cause its Affiliates to) (i) provide, at the request of Buyer, to
Buyer the benefits of any Nonassignable Asset, (ii) cooperate in any lawful
arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer, without incurring any
additional financial obligation to Buyer and (iii) enforce, at the request of
and for the account of Buyer, any rights of Seller arising from any such
Nonassignable Asset against any Third Party or Governmental Body, including
the right to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof upon the
advice of Buyer. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist and

                                      22


<PAGE>



cooperate with Seller in the fulfillment of Seller's obligations under this
Section 2.6(c), provided that Buyer shall not be required by this Section
2.6(c) to enter into any arrangement that would impose any additional cost,
expense or liability or that would deprive Buyer of any benefits or profits.
To the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits of any Nonassignable Asset
(whether from Seller or otherwise), Buyer shall perform, at the direction of
Seller and for the benefit of any Third Party or Governmental Body, the
obligations of Seller thereunder or in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that any Assumed Liability relates to any
Nonassignable Asset, such Assumed Liability shall be deemed to be an Excluded
Liability until such time as the Nonassignable Asset is assigned to Buyer, or
until Buyer (but solely to the extent that) obtains the benefit of such
Nonassignable Asset under this Section 2.6(c).

               (d) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist and
cooperate with Seller to seek to obtain any consent, substitution, approval or
amendment required to novate or assign all obligations under any and all
Contracts or other obligations or liabilities that constitute Assumed
Liabilities or to seek to obtain in writing the unconditional release of
Seller and its Affiliates so that, in any such case where a novation or
assignment is obtained, Buyer and its Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be
solely responsible for such liabilities and obligations after the Closing
Date.

               (e) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and CommScope and their
respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any
financing needed for Buyer to pay the Purchase Price (in accordance with this
Agreement and the Financing Agreement) and any expenses incurred by Buyer and
CommScope in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Collateral Agreements.

               2.7 NO LICENSES

               Unless expressly set forth in the Collateral Agreements, no
title, right or license of any kind is granted to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to Seller's or any of its Affiliate's Proprietary
Information, either directly or indirectly, by implication, by estoppel or
otherwise. Nothing in this Section 2.7 shall affect any title, right or
license (express or implied) of any kind specific to the Inventory being
transferred to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement.

               2.8 Bulk Sales Law

               In consideration of Seller's agreement to indemnify Buyer and
other Indemnified Parties of Buyer pursuant to Section 9.3(b)(ii), Buyer
hereby waives compliance by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries with the
requirements and provisions of any bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar Laws
of any jurisdiction, including Article 6 of the New York Commercial Code, that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale or transfer of any or all
of the Purchased Assets to Buyer.

               2.9 Transfer Taxes

               Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements, Buyer and Seller shall share equally all sales, transfer, value
added (to the extent not creditable) and

                                      23


<PAGE>

or payable by reason of the sales, transfers, leases, rentals, licenses and

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements.

have the resources and capabilities (financial or otherwise) to perform its
obligations hereunder and under the Collateral Agreements; provided that Buyer
shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Section 4.6 if the failure of

from Seller's breach of its obligations under Section 2.6(e).

               (a) Seller will give, and cause its Affiliates to give, to

be during normal business hours and upon not less than two (2) Business Days'
prior written request and shall be subject to such reasonable limitations as
the party having custody or control thereof may impose to preserve the
confidentiality of information contained therein. Any Confidential Information
provided under this Section 5.1(b) may not be disclosed to any Third Party
without the prior consent of the party initially providing such information.
Subject to Section 6.2, this obligation of confidentiality shall cease to
apply to information that is in, or enters into, the public domain through no
breach hereof by the party receiving such information, or is required to be
disclosed as a matter of Law (provided that the party receiving such
information shall give prior notice to the other party of such requirement and
the right to participate in any Action regarding such disclosure, and
provided, further, that the party receiving such information has sought to
obtain all available confidentiality protection for such information when
disclosed).

best efforts to deliver to Buyer an unaudited balance sheet of the FOC Carve
Out Business as of June 30, 2001 and an unaudited statement of operation and

<PAGE>

                                      46


<PAGE>


Seller shall have consented in writing to such action by Buyer or such action
is required by law or a Final Determination or such action is the sole and
exclusive way under the law to claim the benefit of a loss or other Tax
attribute arising in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall not, (x) with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, take any position with respect to Taxes
of the Business or the Transferred Entities that would have the effect of
shifting income to a Pre- Closing Tax Period (it being agreed and understood,
however, that, subject to clause (y), Buyer shall be entitled to file any
Post-Closing Tax Period Tax Return in any manner it chooses in its sole
discretion, and take any position it chooses with respect to any Post-Closing
Tax Period in its sole discretion) or (y) with respect to any Tax period, take
any position with respect to Taxes of the Business or the Transferred Entities
that is inconsistent with the form of the transaction as provided in Article 2
of this Agreement (except for such inconsistencies as are provided in Schedule
3.22(e)) unless, in each case, required by a Final Determination or Seller
shall have consented in writing to such action by Buyer.

Transferred Subsidiary or (ii) fail to use a substantial portion of the
existing assets of each Designated Transferred Subsidiary in a trade or
business conducted by such Designated Transferred Subsidiary. Seller agrees
that all of the assets of the Designated Transferred Subsidiaries, to the
extent used following the Closing in substantially the same manner as they are
used on the date of this Agreement, are used in a trade or business as such
terms are used in the immediately preceding sentence.

               5.4 Tax Reporting and Allocation of Consideration

               (a) Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller will
be responsible for and will perform all Tax withholding, payment and reporting
duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by Seller or any
Selling Subsidiary to any Business Employee in connection with the operation
or conduct of the Business prior to or on the Closing Date and (ii) Buyer will
be responsible for and will perform all Tax withholding, payment and reporting
duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by Buyer to any
Transferred Employee in connection with the operation or conduct of the
Business after the Closing Date.

               (b) Seller shall not take any position with respect to Taxes of
the Business or the Transferred Entities that would have the effect of
shifting income as compared to Seller's past practice to a Post-Closing Tax
Period, except for a position (generally applicable to a Tax Return filed by
the consolidated or combined group of which Seller is the common parent, the
effect of which position is primarily on entities other than the Transferred
Entities) that conforms Seller's Tax reporting to Seller's accounting
reporting under Staff Accounting Bulletin 101.

               (c) Seller and Buyer recognize their mutual obligations
pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code timely to file (or, in the case of Buyer,
to cause the applicable U.S. Subsidiary of Buyer to timely file) IRS Form 8594
(the "Asset Acquisition Statement") with their respective federal income Tax
Returns. Accordingly, Seller and Buyer shall, no later than 120 days after the
Closing Date, attempt in good faith to (i) enter into a Purchase Price
allocation agreement based on an initial proposal by the Buyer providing for
the allocation of the Purchase Price

                                      47


<PAGE>


among the Purchased Assets consistent with Schedule 5.4(c) and the provisions
of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and (ii)
cooperate in the preparation of the Asset Acquisition Statement in accordance
with clause (i) for timely filing with their respective (or, in the case of
Buyer, the applicable U.S. Subsidiary's) federal income Tax Returns. If Seller
and Buyer shall have agreed on a Purchase Price allocation and an Asset
Acquisition Statement, then Seller and Buyer (or Buyer's U.S. Affiliate or
Subsidiary) shall file the Asset Acquisition Statement in the form so agreed
and neither Seller nor Buyer (nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or successors to or transferees of the Business) shall take a Tax
position for U.S. federal, state or local income Tax purposes which is
inconsistent with such Purchase Price allocation, except as otherwise required
pursuant to a Final Determination. In no event shall Seller or Buyer (or any
of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or successors to or transferees
of the Business) take a position for U.S. federal, state or local income tax
purposes that is inconsistent with Schedule 5.4(c), except as otherwise
required pursuant to a Final Determination.

               5.5 BUSINESS EMPLOYEES

                  (a) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall make offers of
employment to all Business Employees listed on Schedule 3.9(a) (including
those absent due to vacation, holiday or leave of absence, but excluding those
absent due to illness or short-term disability or other approved leave of
absence (including under the Family and Medical Leave Act or workers'
compensation)). Business Employees who accept such offer of employment, as of
the effective date of their employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates,
and Transferred Subsidiary
Employees who remain employed by a Transferred Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of a
Transferred Subsidiary immediately following the Closing Date, shall be
referred to as "Immediately Transferred Employees." In addition, Buyer shall
make offers of employment to any Business Employee who is, as of the Closing
Date, absent due to illness or short-term disability or other approved leave
of absence (including under the Family and Medical Leave Act or workers'
compensation) who is able and willing to return to work within 180 days (or
such longer time as may be required by a Collective Bargaining Agreement)
after the Closing Date (a "Returning Inactive Business Employee"). Each
Returning Inactive Business Employee who accepts such offer and actually
returns to work within 180 days (or such longer time as may be required by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement) after the Closing Date shall be referred to
as a "Subsequently Transferred Employee," and the Immediately Transferred
Employees and the Subsequently Transferred Employees shall be referred to
collectively as the "Transferred Employees." Transferred Employees who are
represented by a union or other collective bargaining group are referred to as
"Represented Transferred Employees"; and Transferred Employees who are not
represented by a union or other collective bargaining group are referred to as
"Nonrepresented Transferred Employees." Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, any Business Employee or Transferred Subsidiary Employee whose
employment with Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries, the Transferred Subsidiaries
and the Subsidiaries of the Transferred Subsidiaries terminates before the
Closing Date or who is considered, for purposes of retirement benefits under
any Benefit Plan as having retired as a result of the termination of his or
her employment with Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall not be a
Transferred Employee, regardless of whether he or she is hired by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, and Buyer shall not be obligated to offer employment to


                                      48
<PAGE>

any such individual. Employment of Transferred Employees with Buyer shall be
effective as of the Business Day following the close of business on the
Closing Date, except that the employment of Business Employees receiving
short-term disability benefits or on approved leave of absence on the Closing
Date will become effective as of the date they present themselves for work
with the Buyer if such date is within 180 days (or such longer time as may be
required by a Collective Bargaining Agreement); provided, that Buyer's
obligation to employ any Returning Inactive Business Employee shall be subject
to the availability of a comparable position at such time, subject to
applicable Law, and if no such comparable position is available, such
Returning Inactive Business Employee shall receive severance benefits from
Buyer in accordance with Section 5.5(b)(ii) as if Buyer had terminated such
Returning Inactive Business Employee's employment on the date he or she
presented himself or herself for work with the Buyer (and Buyer shall assume
all liabilities relating to its failure to employ any such Returning Inactive
Business Employee in the same position or a comparable position upon such
employee's failed attempt to return to work after presenting himself or her
herself for work in accordance with applicable Law). Employment with Buyer of
Business Employees based in the United States who are non-immigrant visa
holders for whom a change in immigration status is required prior to
commencement of employment with Buyer shall be effective, however, as of the
day following the close of business on the date such change becomes effective;
provided, however, that Seller shall offer to continue to employ such Business
Employees until such change becomes effective for the purpose of providing
services for the benefit of Buyer, and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all
compensation, employee benefits and other costs incurred or provided by Seller
in continuing to employ such Business Employees and providing such services to
Buyer during such period on a basis to be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer,
which is not inconsistent with the methodologies used in the Transition
Services Agreement. The date on which an Immediately Transferred Employee's
employment with Buyer becomes effective, is referred to as the "Initial Start
Date," for Subsequently Transferred Employees, such date is referred to as the
"Subsequent Start Date," and each such effective date is a "Start Date."
Except as specifically provided in this Section 5.5, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any and all claims,
causes of actions, charges or suits asserted or brought by any Business
Employee arising out of or in connection with the Buyer's employment of or
failure to offer employment to, or Buyer's termination of employment of, any
Business Employee not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including claims for severance or other separation benefits and employment
discrimination claims.

                  (b) (i) As of the applicable Start Date, and until at least
December 31, 2002, Buyer shall provide Transferred Employees a total
compensation package of salary, bonus opportunity and benefits that, in the
aggregate, is no less favorable than that provided to them by Seller or the
applicable Selling Subsidiary as of the date hereof, including under all
Benefit Plans, or, if less favorable, those provided by Seller or the
applicable Selling Subsidiaries to its similarly situated employees at the
relevant time. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.5, no assets of
any Benefit Plan shall be transferred to Buyer. Each employee benefit plan,
program, policy and arrangement of Buyer, including Pension Plans, Welfare
Plans, vacation plans and severance plans, shall recognize (x) for purposes of
satisfying any deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums during the
coverage period that includes the Closing Date, any payment made by any
Transferred Employee towards deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums
in any health or other insurance plan of Seller or a Selling Subsidiary and
(y) for

                                      49


<PAGE>


purposes of eligibility to participate, early retirement eligibility, early
retirement subsidies, vesting, schedule of benefits and benefit accrual other
than under defined benefit pension plans, all service with Seller or a Selling
Subsidiary, including service with predecessor employers that was recognized
by Seller or a Selling Subsidiary and any prior unbridged service with Seller
or a Selling Subsidiary; provided that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Buyer
will continue to provide relocation assistance to those Transferred Employees
receiving it as of the Initial Start Date and tuition assistance to those
Transferred Employees who are receiving such benefits as of the Initial Start
Date for the current academic session. Buyer shall pay to each Transferred
Employee any fees to which he or she would have been entitled under the Lucent
Work With ME Program; provided, however, he or she and the referred individual
remain employed by Buyer and/or Seller and/or one or more of any of their
respective Affiliates throughout the required period. Buyer will honor the
terms and conditions of Seller's international assignee program, including
repatriation upon completion of assignment, completion bonuses, Tax
equalization and Tax Return preparation, with respect to Transferred Employees
who are on international assignment as of the Closing Date, except that these
costs shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller based on the portion of the
international assignment occurring prior to the Closing Date (which shall be
Seller's obligation) and on or after the Closing Date (which shall be Buyer's
obligation).

                    (ii) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a severance or termination
of employment of any Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and that such employees will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
Closing Date and their respective Start Dates. Except as specified in Section
5.5(q), Seller shall be solely responsible for all liabilities for severance
pay and benefits, redundancy pay and benefits, termination pay and benefits,
payments and benefits in lieu of notice, indemnity or other payments resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising on or prior to
the Closing Date, supplemental pension benefits and similar obligations
(whether arising under applicable Law or a Benefit Plan or otherwise) (x) with
respect to Employees that arise as a result of the actual or constructive
termination of their employment with Seller and its Affiliates, (y) with
respect to Business Employees as to whom Buyer complies with Section 5.5(a)
who do not become Transferred Employees and/or (z) that arise out of or result
from actions of Seller and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, until at least December 31, 2002, Buyer shall
provide severance benefits and/or supplemental pension benefits which are no
less favorable than those provided under Seller's Management Separation Plan
and Retirement Income Plan (each as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
(A) to Nonrepresented Transferred Employees in the United States whose
employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates is terminated after their Start
Dates and on or before December 31, 2002 that are equivalent to the benefits,
if any, that would have been paid to such Transferred Employees had they been
declared "at risk" and terminated employment under the Lucent Management
Separation Plan and the Lucent Retirement Income Plan (the "LRIP"), as in
effect as of the Closing Date and (B) to Nonrepresented Transferred Employees
outside the United States whose employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates
is terminated after their Start Dates that are equivalent to the benefits they
would have received under the applicable severance plans and policies of
Seller or its Affiliate had such plans and policies, as in effect on the
Closing Date,

                                      50


<PAGE>


applied to such termination of employment (but not less than any minimum
statutory severance obligations under local Law).

               (c) Buyer agrees that its health and welfare plans in which
Transferred Employees participate on and after their respective Start Dates
shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusion (to the extent such exclusion
was waived under applicable health and welfare plans offered to the
Transferred Employees by the Seller or any Selling Subsidiary) and any proof
of insurability in respect of Transferred Employees. Seller agrees to transfer
the cafeteria plan accounts and experience of Transferred Employees to
substantially equivalent plans that exist or will be established by Buyer to
the extent permitted by applicable plan terms and applicable Law. Seller shall
remain responsible for any benefits payable under a Benefit Plan with respect
to (i) claims incurred by Business Employees who do not become Transferred
Employees and (ii) claims incurred by Transferred Employees prior to their
respective Start Dates except to the extent that the liability for such
benefits has been transferred to and assumed by Buyer and their benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements in accordance with this Section 5.5. The
medical and dental plans maintained by Buyer shall recognize as dependents of
the Transferred Employees any Class 2 dependents recognized by Seller's
medical and dental plans.

               (d)  (i) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but
in no event later than 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have in
effect one or more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify
under Sections 401(a) and 40l(k) of the Code that provide coverage to
Nonrepresented Transferred Employees, and shall maintain such plan or plans
for three years after the Closing Date.

                    (ii) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
but in no event later than 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have
in effect one or more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify
under Sections 401(a) and 40l(k) of the Code (the "Buyer Represented Savings
Plan") that provides Represented Transferred Employees, for three years after
the Closing Date, with an election to retain Lucent common stock, Avaya Inc.
common stock and, if applicable, Agere Systems Inc. common stock held in the
Lucent Stock Fund, the Avaya Stock Fund, the Agere Stock Fund (if applicable
due to a distribution of Agere common stock by Seller before the Closing Date)
or the Employer Shares Fund within the Lucent Technologies Inc. Long Term
Savings and Security Plan ("LTSSP"); provided that Seller shall not permit,
and shall cause the LTSSP not to permit, Transferred Employees to elect to
acquire any additional shares of such common stock in their accounts in the
LTSSP after the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer and the Buyer Represented
Savings Plan shall not be required (i) to permit Transferred Represented
Savings Plan Participants to acquire additional shares of such common stock in
their accounts under the Buyer Represented Savings Plan, nor (ii) to comply
with the requirements of the preceding sentence to the extent Buyer or any
fiduciary of the Buyer Represented Savings Plan determines that to do so would
be inconsistent with its obligations under ERISA. Upon the receipt by Seller
of written evidence of (i) the adoption of the Buyer Represented Savings Plan
by Buyer, (ii) the creation of the trust thereunder and (iii) an opinion of
Buyer's counsel to the effect that the terms of Buyer Represented Savings Plan
meet the applicable requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code and
the related trust thereunder is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code, Seller shall direct the trustee of

                                      51


<PAGE>


the LTSSP to transfer to the trust under the Buyer Represented Savings Plan
liability for the account balance of each participant in the LTSSP who is both
an Immediately Transferred Employee and a Represented Transferred Employee,
together with cash, cash equivalents or other mutually acceptable property,
the value of which on such transfer date is equal to such liability. A similar
transfer of assets and liabilities from the LTSSP to the Buyer Represented
Savings Plan for Subsequently Transferred Employees who are Represented
Transferred Employees shall be carried out as soon as practicable after the
180th day following the Closing Date. Upon completion of each the transfers
described herein, the LTSSP shall be relieved of, and the Buyer Represented
Savings Plan shall assume liabilities for the payment of the account balances
of the Represented Transferred Employees transferred to the Buyer Represented
Savings Plan in such transfer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in the filing
of any IRS Forms 5310 required by the transfer of assets and liabilities
described herein, and anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the transfer of assets and liabilities described herein shall
not take place until the 31st day following the filing of all required IRS
Forms 5310 with respect to such transfer.

               (e) Buyer's pension plans and their related trusts (and any
successor to such plans and/or trusts) shall provide (i) that with respect to
assets transferred to Buyer's pension plans in accordance with this Section
5.5, such assets shall be held by the trusts which are a part of Buyer's
pension plans for the exclusive benefit of the participants in such plans;
(ii) that the accrued benefits as of the Closing Date of each Transferred
Employee may not be decreased by amendment or otherwise; (iii) that each
Transferred Employee shall have the right to receive his or her benefit
accrued through the Closing Date under the Lucent Occupational Plan or LRIP,
as the case may be, in any optional form provided under such plans; (iv) that
until December 31, 2002, each Transferred Employee shall accrue benefits
thereunder pursuant to benefit formulas that are no less favorable than those
provided in the Lucent Occupational Plan or LRIP, as the case may be, each as
in effect on the Closing Date or, if less favorable, as in effect at the
relevant time thereafter; and (v) that each Transferred Employee, upon his or
her termination of employment on or before December 31, 2002, shall have the
right to receive a benefit that is no less than the sum of (1) his or her
accrued benefit under Buyer's pension plans as of the expiration of such
period, determined after taking into account any increase in the Transferred
Employee's compensation following the expiration of such period and (2) any
additional benefit accrued following the expiration of such period.

               (f) In connection with the performance of its obligations under
Section 5.5(e), Buyer shall, on or prior to a date (the "First Transfer Date")
to be mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller but in no event more than 180 days
after the Closing Date, establish or amend two or more defined benefit pension
plans (the "Buyer Represented Pension Plan" and the "Buyer Nonrepresented
Pension Plan", collectively referred to as the "Buyer Pension Plans"), with
trusts thereunder (the "Represented Pension Trust" and the "Nonrepresented
Pension Trust"), for the purpose of accepting a transfer of the pension plan
liabilities and assets attributable to Represented Transferred Employees and
Nonrepresented Transferred Employees, respectively, as described herein. On
the First Transfer Date, Seller will transfer or cause to be transferred from
the trust under the Lucent Technologies Inc. Pension Plan (the "Lucent
Occupational Plan") to the Represented Pension Trust, and from the trust under
the LRIP to the Nonrepresented Pension Trust, cash or, to the extent agreed by
the parties, marketable securities in an amount

                                      52


<PAGE>


(the "First Pension Transfer Amount") equal to 90% of the estimated Pension
Transfer Amount for the Represented Transferred Employees and Nonrepresented
Transferred Employees, respectively, plus earnings on the amounts transferred
from the Closing Date through the First Transfer Date at the Discount Rate
(used for purposes of Section 5.5(g)). As of the first administratively
practicable date at least 180 days after the First Transfer Date or such later
date as may be agreed to by the parties (the "Second Transfer Date"), Seller
shall transfer or cause to be transferred from the trust under the Lucent
Occupational Plan to the Represented Pension Trust, and from the trust under
the LRIP to the Nonrepresented Pension Trust, respectively, cash or, to the
extent agreed by the parties, marketable securities in an amount (the "Second
Pension Transfer Amount") equal to (A) the sum of (i) the Pension Transfer
Amount updated to reflect benefit obligations relating to any Subsequently
Transferred Employees, minus the First Pension Transfer Amount, plus (ii)
earnings on the amount described in clause (i) from the Closing Date through
the Second Transfer Date at a rate equal to the Discount Rate, reduced by (B)
the sum of (iii) the aggregate amount of any pension benefit payments made by
the Lucent Occupational Plan on behalf of the Buyer's Represented Pension
Plan, and the LRIP on behalf of the Buyer's Nonrepresented Pension Plan, as
the case may be, from the Closing Date through the Second Transfer Date, plus
(iv) earnings on the amount described in clause (iii) from the Closing Date
through the Second Transfer Date at a rate equal to one-half the Discount
Rate. In the event the Second Pension Transfer Amount is less than zero, then
Buyer shall transfer or cause to be transferred such amount in cash or, to the
extent agreed by the parties, marketable securities, from the Represented
Pension Trust back to the trust under the Lucent Occupational Plan, or from
the Nonrepresented Pension Trust back to the trust under the LRIP, as the case
may be. Subject to the completion of the asset transfers described in this
Section 5.5(f), all of the obligations and associated liabilities of the
Lucent Occupational Plan relating to the Represented Transferred Employees as
of the Closing Date shall be assumed in full by the Represented Pension Trust
and the Buyer Represented Pension Plan, and all the obligations and associated
liabilities of the LRIP relating to the Nonrepresented Transferred Employees
shall be assumed in full by the Nonrepresented Pension Trust and the Buyer
Nonrepresented Pension Plan.

               (g) For purposes of this Section 5.5, the "Pension Transfer
Amount" shall be determined separately for the Lucent Occupational Plan and
the LRIP, and shall mean the greater of (A) and (B), where (A) shall be the
minimum required transfer amount determined in accordance with the terms of
the applicable plan and the requirements of Section 414(1) of the Code,
utilizing the "safe harbor" rates and assumptions set forth in the regulations
promulgated under Section 4044 of ERISA as of the Closing Date, except that
the termination and retirement rate assumptions utilized for purposes of this
Section 5.5(g) shall be the assumptions used by Seller to determine the
funding requirements for the 2000 plan year and no expense load, including any
loading charge determined under the Loading Assumptions set forth in Appendix
C to Part 4044 of the PBGC Regulations, shall be charged, and (B) shall be the
sum of (I) and (II) less (III), where (I) is the projected benefit obligation
under FAS 87 as of the Closing Date with respect to Represented Transferred
Employees (for the Lucent Occupational Plan transfer) and with respect to
Nonrepresented Transferred Employees (for the LRIP transfer), (II) is the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for postretirement medical and
dental plans under FAS 106 as of the Closing Date with respect to Represented
Transferred Employees (for the Occupational Plan transfer), and with respect
to Nonrepresented Transferred Employees (for the LRIP transfer) and (III) is
the amount transferred under Section 5.5(h)(i) with respect to the

                                      53


<PAGE>


postretirement medical and dental plans for Represented Transferred Employees
(for the Lucent Occupational Pension Plan transfer), and zero (for the LRIP
transfer). For purposes of the preceding sentence, such projected benefit
obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation shall be
determined on the basis of the plan provisions in effect on the Closing Date
and the actuarial methods and assumptions used by Seller for purposes of
Seller's financial disclosures under FAS 87 and FAS 106 for such plans as of
September 30, 2000, except that the discount rate used shall be 7.25%
compounded annually (the "Discount Rate").

               (h) Assets of certain of Seller's Voluntary Employees' Benefits
Associations ("VEBAs") will be transferred to Buyer's VEBAs as described in
this Section 5.5(h).

                    (i) This Section 5.5(h)(i) shall govern the transfer of
assets from the Lucent Postretirement Health VEBA for occupational employees
to one or more corresponding Buyer Postretirement Health VEBAs, which Buyer
shall establish and submit to the IRS for a favorable ruling as to its
tax-exempt status prior to the Second Transfer Date. If Seller is reasonably
satisfied that the corresponding Buyer Postretirement Health VEBA is tax-
exempt under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, then on or prior to the Second
Transfer Date, Seller shall determine the aggregate value, as of the Closing
Date, of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of each Lucent plan
funded by such Lucent Postretirement Health VEBA, with respect to all
Represented Transferred Employees, and shall transfer or cause to be
transferred cash or, to the extent agreed by the parties, marketable
securities in an amount determined as set forth below. Such amount shall be
equal to the fair market value as of the Closing Date of the assets of the
plan funded by such Lucent Postretirement Health VEBA multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the accumulated postretirement
health benefit obligation under FAS 106 for Represented Transferred Employees
whose postretirement health benefit is funded by such Lucent Postretirement
Health VEBA and their dependents, and the denominator of which shall be the
accumulated postretirement health benefit obligation under FAS 106 for all
participants and dependents whose postretirement health benefit is funded by
such Lucent Postretirement Health VEBA.

                    (ii) This Section 5.5(h)(ii) shall govern the transfer of
assets from the Lucent Postretirement Life VEBA to a corresponding Buyer
Postretirement Life VEBA, which Buyer shall establish and submit to the IRS
for a favorable ruling as to its tax-exempt status prior to the Second
Transfer Date. If Seller is reasonably satisfied that the corresponding Buyer
Postretirement Life VEBA is tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,
then on or prior to the Second Transfer Date, Seller shall determine the
aggregate value, as of the Closing Date, of the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation of the Lucent plan funded by such Lucent Postretirement
Life VEBA, with respect to all Represented Transferred Employees, and shall
transfer or cause to be transferred cash in an amount determined as set forth
below. Such amount shall be equal to the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation under FAS 106 for Represented Transferred Employees whose
postretirement life benefit is funded by such Lucent Postretirement Life VEBA.
Buyer and Seller shall adopt, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their insurers to adopt, procedures to implement such asset transfers in
a reasonable and expeditious manner that is consistent with the underlying
group life insurance contracts and applicable legal requirements.


                                      54


<PAGE>

               For purposes of computing the denominator used in the VEBA
asset transfer calculations set forth in the last sentence of Section
5.5(h)(i), all determinations shall be made as of the Closing Date, based on
the active and inactive census data as of the Closing Date. For purposes of
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, assumptions and
methods used by Lucent in determining the disclosure of accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation under FAS106 as of September 30, 2000,
except that the discount rate used shall be the Discount Rate. The amounts to
be transferred as described above shall be adjusted by the aggregate amount of
any payments made by a Lucent VEBA in respect of Represented Transferred
Employees and their dependents (and by the aggregate amount of any payments
made by a Buyer VEBA on behalf of the Lucent VEBA) prior to such transfer, and
increased by interest at the Discount Rate on such amounts from the Closing
Date through the date of such transfer. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted to provide that any assets so transferred have reverted to Seller
or Buyer.

               (i) Seller, on or prior to the Second Transfer Date, shall
notify Buyer in writing of Seller's determination of the amounts of assets
required to be transferred in accordance with the provisions of Sections
5.5(f), (g), and (h), shall provide Buyer with a copy of the actuarial reports
relating to the determination of such amounts, together with such related
materials as Buyer may reasonably request (including all census information
required to perform an appropriate review), and shall provide Buyer with a
written determination by Seller's actuary that the amounts of assets proposed
to be transferred are not less than the required amounts determined in
accordance with this Agreement.

               (j) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of Buyer's
disagreement with any determination made by Seller pursuant to Section 5.5(i)
as soon as practicable and in any event within 60 days after the date as of
which all information specified in Section 5.5(i) has been provided to Buyer.
If no such notice is given by Buyer prior to the expiration of the foregoing
period, the determinations contained in Seller's notice to Buyer shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. If Buyer gives written notice to
Seller prior to the expiration of the foregoing period setting forth any
objections to the determinations made by Seller, the parties shall attempt in
good faith to reach an agreement as to all matters in dispute. Buyer shall not
be entitled to object to the determinations of Seller based on any
disagreement as to the rates or assumptions used by Seller so long as such
rates and assumptions are those specified in this Section 5.5. The
determinations of Seller's actuary under Sections 5.5(f), (g), and (h) shall
be conclusive unless Buyer's actuary claims that the proper total of such
amounts differs from Seller's determination by more than 1%. If the parties,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve all matters in dispute
within 30 days after Buyer advises Seller of its objections, and the amount in
dispute is greater than 1% of the total amount determined by Seller's actuary
under Sections 5.5(f), (g), and (h), then any remaining disputed matters shall
be finally and conclusively determined by a qualified independent actuary
selected by Seller and Buyer, which actuary shall not be the regular actuary
of either party. Promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after its
acceptance of its appointment, the actuary shall determine (based solely on
presentations by Seller and Buyer and not by independent review) only those
matters in dispute and shall render a written report as to the disputed
matters and the resulting calculation of the pension or other assets required
to be transferred by Seller in accordance with the provisions of Sections
5.5(f), (g), or

                                      55


<PAGE>


(h), which report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The parties
shall share the fees and expenses of the independent actuary equally.


               (k) Seller hereby acknowledges that for FICA and FUTA Tax
purposes, Buyer qualifies as a successor employer with respect to the
Transferred Employees. In connection with the foregoing, at Buyer's option,
Seller agrees to follow the "Alternative Procedures" set forth in Section 5 of
Revenue Procedure 96-60. Buyer shall notify Seller of its intention to follow
the "Alternative Procedures" on or immediately after the Closing Date. If the
"Alternative Procedures" are followed, Seller and Buyer understand that Buyer
shall assume Seller's entire obligation to furnish a Form W-2, Wage and Tax
Statement, to the Transferred Employees. In addition to all personnel files
and records relating to the Transferred Employees that Seller shall deliver to
Buyer as of the Closing Date or as otherwise required by this Agreement,
Seller shall timely provide Buyer with any and all other information (and in
such format and media) as it shall reasonably request to properly comply with
the requirements in the preceding sentence, which in no event shall be more
than 10 Business Days from the date of a written request for such information.

               (l)  (i) Buyer shall assume the Collective Bargaining Agreements
identified in Schedule 5.5(l)(i) effective as of the Initial Start Date,
subject to certain modifications (a) reflecting the identity of Buyer as the
new employer, (b) reflecting the inapplicability of certain provisions of the
Collective Bargaining Agreements to the Transferred Employees resulting from
the Buyer's purchase of only a portion of the Seller's operation, and (c) to
the provisions of the Neutrality Agreement such that the Neutrality Agreement
shall be limited in its scope to only those corporate entities and facilities
listed on Schedule 5.5(l)(i), and shall not apply to any other corporate
entities or facilities even if by its terms it would so apply as a result of
changed circumstances. In the event that any modification set forth in clauses
(a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.5(l)(i) is not made to the Collective
Bargaining Agreements, Buyer shall not be obligated to assume the Collective
Bargaining Agreements, and the Collective Bargaining Agreements shall be
deemed Excluded Assets.

                    (ii) Buyer shall assume each Employment Agreement with a
Business Employee that is either required by applicable law or identified in
Schedule 5.5(l)(ii), in each case effective as of the Start Date for the
Business Employee who is party thereto, and provided that such Business
Employee has become a Transferred Employee.

               (m) Seller shall make and be responsible for incentive
compensation payments to Nonrepresented Transferred Employees for the period
from October 1, 2000, through the Closing Date in accordance with its
short-term incentive plan in effect for such period.

              (n) Seller shall be responsible for and shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer for any failure to provide health
continuation coverage (including any penalties, excise taxes or interest
resulting from the failure to provide continuation coverage) required by
Section 4980B of the Code due to any qualifying event with respect to any
Transferred Employee or any dependent thereof that occurs on or before the
Transferred Employee's Start Date. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any failure to provide health
continuation coverage (including any penalties, excise taxes or interest
resulting from the failure to provide continuation coverage) required by
Section 4980B

                                      56


<PAGE>


of the Code due to any qualifying event with respect to any
Transferred Employee or any dependent thereof that occurs after the
Transferred Employee's Start Date.


               (o)  (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall adopt, or
cause to be adopted, plans for the benefit of Transferred Employees employed
outside the United States ("Non-U.S. Plans"). Where applicable Law or rules of
any non-U.S. jurisdiction provide for the transfer of employment of the
Business Employees upon a sale of the Business, (x) Buyer shall assume and
honor all terms and conditions of employment in respect of the Business
Employees to the extent required to accomplish such transfer of employment and
(y) Buyer and Seller agree to take such actions as are reasonably practicable
(including the assumption, if necessary, of potential or actual liabilities
relating to the employment of Business Employees) such that the employment of
the Business Employees will transfer to the Buyer and/or one or more of its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries as a matter of Law on the Initial Start Date.
Buyer shall offer to employ each Business Employee at the same salary or wages
payable by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries to such Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall maintain terms and conditions
of employment which replicate those provided by Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date as and to the extent
required by applicable Law (including the E.U. Acquired Rights Directive) or
as a result of negotiation with applicable works councils and/or unions. All
offers of employment made by Buyer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall
be sufficient to avoid statutory severance obligations, other than where such
severance is automatic, in which event such severance shall be borne by
Seller. Buyer shall bear all expenses of any compensation resulting from
negotiations with works councils and/or unions and agreed to by Buyer for
which Seller is not specifically liable under this Agreement. Nothing herein
shall be construed as a representation or guarantee by Seller that Business
Employees will accept Buyer's or its Affiliate's or Subsidiary's offer of
employment or will continue in employment following the Closing Date. Buyer
and Seller agree to comply with all applicable local Laws and collective
agreements pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement.

                    (ii) As of the Closing Date, to the extent Legally
Permitted: (A) liabilities of the Non-U.S. Plans of Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller relating to Transferred Employees or Denmark Transferred Employees, as
applicable, shall be assumed by the appropriate Non-U.S. Plans of Buyer (or,
in the case of a Benefit Plan maintained by the Denmark Transferred Subsidiary
(a "Denmark Plan"), by the appropriate Non-U.S. Plans of Seller); and (B) a
portion of any assets of the Non-U.S. Plans of Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller or the Denmark Plan, as applicable, shall be transferred to the
appropriate Non-U.S. Plans of Buyer or Seller, as applicable, in accordance
with this Section 5.5(o)(ii). If a Non-U.S. Plan specifies a transfer basis,
that basis shall be used to compute the asset transfer amount. Otherwise, the
asset transfer amount shall be the amount for each Transferred Employee or
Transferred Denmark Employee, as applicable, that has been individually
funded/insured for that employee if funding/insuring is performed on an
individual-by-individual basis. If neither of the two immediately preceding
sentences apply, the asset transfer amount for each Transferred Employee or
Transferred Denmark Employee, as applicable, shall be the accumulated benefit
obligation multiplied by the present benefit obligation funded percentage,
both determined on the basis of the actuarial methods and assumptions that are
consistent with applicable local convention and custom. Where required, the
parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to obtain any

                                      57


<PAGE>

necessary consents to such transfer of assets and liabilities. If such a
transfer is made by Seller or Buyer, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, expressly
agrees that it will not take any direct or indirect action to revert pension
assets for a period of five years following the applicable Closing.

                    (iii) For purposes of this Section 5.5(o), "Legally
Permitted" means permitted under the laws of the country, the labor union,
works council or collective agreement, including after expiration of any
mandated waiting periods before which expiration working conditions (including
benefits) cannot be changed, and including actions allowed after receiving
consent from individual employees and/or plan trustees, foundation boards and
members and any other organizations having a recognized right to determine or
affect benefits and/or funding of a plan.

               (p) Seller shall periodically deliver to Buyer an updated
Schedule 3.9(a), with the last such update being provided within five Business
Days after the Closing Date with information accurate as of the Closing Date.
From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer, upon
Buyer's request, with copies of all such Benefit Plans, Employment Agreements
and Collective Bargaining Agreements and amendments thereto that it has not
provided to Buyer before the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall not be obligated to comply with any
requirement of Section 5.5(a), (b), (c) or (e) with respect to a Transferred
Employee to the extent Seller has failed to provide, on Schedule 3.9(a) as so
updated, the information necessary for it to do so with respect to such
Transferred Employee. In addition, Seller shall provide to Buyer, upon Buyer's
request, a breakdown of the information provided pursuant to Section 5.5(i)
showing such information on an employee-by-employee basis in such a manner

compensation and benefits (in the aggregate or in particular) shall apply to
Represented Transferred Employees to the extent permitted as a result of any
changes pursuant to collective bargaining. No provision of this Section 5.5

Transferred Employees following termination of their employment with Buyer,
other than compensation and benefits that are by their nature provided after
termination of employment (such as severance pay and retirement benefits).

               (t) To the extent the Denmark Transferred Subsidiary: (i)
employs any individual who is not a Transferred Subsidiary Employee, the
employment of such individual (a "Transferred Denmark Employee") shall be

Entity prior to the Closing Date, in a manner that would satisfy the
requirements of Section 5.5(o)(i), if such Transferred Denmark Employee had

Benefit Plan and any related funding information shall be provided to Buyer as
soon as practicable following the date hereof, and any individuals specified
in clause (i) hereof shall cease participation in such Benefit Plan as of the
Closing Date.

               (u) The Transition Services Agreement shall include schedules
relating to human resources services substantially in the form attached hereto
in Schedule 5.5(u), with such changes as Seller and Buyer may hereafter agree.
Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to finalize such schedules,
together with additional schedules providing for human resources services
(including payroll and benefits where necessary) for Transferred Employees
outside the United States, in order to fulfill their obligations under clauses
(vi) and (vii) of Section 5.7.

               5.6 LEASED EQUIPMENT

Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary transferring and assigning and
Buyer assuming the leases for such equipment (the "Assumed Leased Equipment"),

the costs of purchasing such equipment pursuant to the leases (the "Purchased
Leased Equipment") or (iii) remain the property of Seller or a Subsidiary as
of the Closing Date (the "Excluded Leased Equipment").

               5.7 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS

                  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Collateral

                                      59


<PAGE>


Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Bodies, if any) and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body, (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the

portion of the Business that would not constitute a material portion of the
assets and businesses of Buyer, its Subsidiaries and the Cable JV, taken as a
whole, immediately following the Closing.

               5.8 PERMIT TRANSFER

               (a) Except for those Governmental Permits that are not
transferable by Law, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the issuance or transfer of the Governmental Permits to
Buyer (or Affiliates, Subsidiaries, assignees, designees or nominees of Buyer)
upon the Closing Date in form and substance the same as the Governmental
Permits that were held by Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, provided that
Buyer may in its discretion elect for any of the Governmental Permits not to
be issued or transferred to Buyer but to be retained or surrendered by Seller
or the Selling Subsidiaries. Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling
Subsidiaries to, give and make all required notices and reports to the
appropriate Governmental Bodies and Persons with respect to the Governmental
Permits that may be necessary for the sale and purchase of the Business and
the ownership, operation and use of the Purchased Assets by Buyer (or its
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, assignees, designees or nominees) after the Closing
Date.

               (b) Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to,
assist and cooperate with Buyer in obtaining the issuance in the name of Buyer
(or any Affiliate, Subsidiary, assignee, designee or nominee of Buyer) of any
Governmental Permits that is not transferable, and Seller shall, and shall
cause the Selling Subsidiaries to, take all actions reasonably requested by
Buyer to facilitate that issuance, including the preparation of any
Governmental Permit applications or necessary documents, whether for signature
by Seller or by Buyer.

               (c) If any Governmental Permits to be transferred or issued to
Buyer hereunder is not transferred or issued to Buyer (or any designated
Affiliate, Subsidiary, assignee,

                                      60


<PAGE>


designee or nominee of Buyer) on or before
the Closing Date in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to implement such
transfer or issuance as promptly as practicable. Pending any delayed transfer
or issuance, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries undertake to maintain in
force, and authorize Buyer to operate under and utilize, the Governmental
Permits in question, to the extent permitted by Law, for the period from and
after the Closing Date until such Governmental Permits are issued or
transferred to Buyer.

               (d) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist and
cooperate with Seller in the fulfillment of Seller's obligations under this
Section 5.8.

               5.9 ADVICE OF CHANGES

               Seller will promptly advise Buyer in writing of (i) any event
known to Seller that would render any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement, if made on or as of
the date of such event or the Closing Date, untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) any change, condition or event that has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any failure
of Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied hereunder.

               5.10 THIRD PARTY CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS

               On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer
with originals or true and complete copies of all agreements, contracts and
instruments pursuant to which, since January 1, 2000, in connection with the
proposed sale of the Business or any material portion thereof, Seller or any
of its Affiliates has disclosed on a confidential basis any Confidential
Information of, or relating to, the Business to any Third Party (collectively,
"Third Party Confidentiality Agreements"). Within (2) two Business Days after
the date hereof, Seller shall request that all parties (other than any party
with whom Seller is actively engaged in negotiations with respect to a
potential business combination or other similar transaction) who received
Confidential Information of or relating to the Business return such
Confidential Information in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
Third Party Confidentiality Agreement.

               5.11 USE OF LUCENT'S NAME

               Buyer agrees that (i) as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing, it shall mark products and other property, both internally and
externally, with Buyer's name and mark and shall remove and cease to mark
products and other property with the names, marks or other indicia of
"Lucent," "Lucent Technologies," "Bell Labs," the Lucent Innovation Ring logo
or other similar mark; provided, however, that for a period of six (6) months
following the Closing Date, Buyer may continue to use or dispose of any
Inventory product specifications, manuals and other accompanying materials,
and packaging and shipping materials that bear the mark "Lucent," "Lucent
Technologies" or other similar mark, in a manner consistent with that employed
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) it shall not advertise or hold
itself out as Lucent or an Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date. Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the names of all applicable
Transferred Entities to be changed to delete any references to "Lucent" from
such names as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.

               5.12 NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES

               (a) None of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives will at any time prior to two (2) years from the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of any
Transferred Employee or Transferred Subsidiary Employee or induce or
encourage, or assist others to induce or encourage, any Employee to decline an
employment arrangement with Buyer, in each case without Buyer's prior written
consent. For purposes of this Section 5.12(a), the term "solicit the
employment" shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees
through media advertisements, employment firms or otherwise that are not
focused on Persons employed by Buyer and its Affiliates or any successor. This
restriction shall not apply to any Employee whose employment with Buyer or its
successor is involuntarily terminated by Buyer or its successor after the
Closing or who has retired in good standing from Buyer or its successor.
Solicitation of employment shall be deemed to occur if the Persons who perform
such solicitation have knowledge of this Agreement or if such Persons have no
knowledge of this Agreement but Seller's employees with knowledge of this
Agreement have advance knowledge of any such solicitation. Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to communicate the restrictions imposed by this
Section 5.12(a) to all Persons who would reasonably be expected to engage in
such solicitations and instruct such Persons to comply with such restrictions.

               (b) None of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives will at any time prior to two (2) years from the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of any employee
of Seller without Seller's prior written consent. For purposes of this Section
5.12(b), the term "solicit the employment" shall not be deemed to include
generalized searches for employees through media advertisements, employment
firms or otherwise that are not focused on Persons employed by Seller and its
Affiliates or any successor. This restriction shall not apply to any employee
whose employment with Seller is involuntarily terminated by Seller or its
successor after the Closing or who has retired in good standing from Seller or
its successor. Solicitation of employment shall be deemed to occur if the
Persons who perform such solicitation have knowledge of this Agreement or if
such Persons have no knowledge of this Agreement but Buyer's employees with
knowledge of this Agreement have advance knowledge of any such solicitation.
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the restrictions
imposed by this Section 5.12(b) to all Persons who would reasonably be
expected to engage in such solicitations and instruct such Persons to comply
with such restrictions.

               5.13 NO NEGOTIATION OR SOLICITATION

               Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates will not
(and Seller will cause each of its employees, officers, directors,
representatives and agents not to) (a) solicit, initiate, consider, entertain,
encourage or accept the submission of any proposal or offer from any Third
Party relating to the direct or indirect acquisition of the Business or
(except to the extent permitted by Section 5.2) any portion of the Purchased
Assets, or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations (and Seller
shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are ongoing)
regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in,
or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Third Party to
do or seek any of the

                                      62


<PAGE>


foregoing. Seller will notify Buyer promptly (but in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) if any Third Party makes any proposal, offer, inquiry
or contact with respect to any of the foregoing (including the terms thereof
and the identity of such Third Party).

               5.14 NON-COMPETITION

               (a) Seller agrees that, for five (5) years after the Closing
Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, engage in any business or other
endeavor of a kind being conducted by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries as
of and prior to the Closing Date through their ownership of OFS, the Business
or the Purchased Assets, in any area of the world; provided, however, that
neither Seller nor any Selling Subsidiary shall be prevented from:

                    (i) maintaining and continuing in accordance with current
and past practices the operations of Seller and any Selling Subsidiary that
are not being sold hereunder; provided that such practices do not relate to
the Business;

                    (ii) continuing to own the shares of capital stock,
partnership or other equity interests in any Person owned by Seller or any
Selling Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement (subject to Section 8.5,
other than the Transferred Entities) and set forth on Schedule 5.14;

                    (iii) acquiring shares of capital stock, partnership or
other equity interests in any Person as investments of Seller's pension funds

engaged in the same business as the Business;

                    (iv) subject to Section 5.14(b), acquiring ownership of or
any equity interest in any Person, provided that (i) the annual revenues of
such Person from any business that competes with the Business are not more
than 25% of such Person's total annual revenues and (ii) such equity
investment is made by Seller's venture capital business group in the ordinary
course of business and (x) represents less than 20% of the securities entitled

aggregate;

                    (v) selling or reselling fiber optic cable or optical
fiber to satisfy its contractual obligation under a Retained Contract (without
giving effect to any amendments, modifications or waivers made after the date
hereof) and, in the case of an Accepted Retained Contract, only in accordance
with the supply arrangement with Buyer to be entered into pursuant to Section
5.17(b);

                    (vi) selling or reselling products (A) through
incorporation into finished products other than those manufactured or sold by
the Business, "turnkey" projects or Seller-installed systems or (B) to dispose

procedures established in the Supply Agreement; or

                    (vii) performing any act or conducting any business

                                      63


<PAGE>


               (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.14(a), in the event that during the five (5) year non-competition
period Seller completes a business combination transaction with a Person that
is engaged in any business or other endeavor of a kind currently being
conducted by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries through their ownership of
OFS, the Business or the Purchased Assets, which transaction results in the
holders of voting securities of Seller outstanding immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction owning less than 50% of the voting power of
the voting securities of Seller or the surviving entity in the transaction or
any parent thereof (any such entity, an "Acquiror") outstanding immediately
after the consummation of such business combination transaction, nothing
contained in this Section 5.14 shall prevent Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates from competing with the Business or engaging in any
other activity prohibited or restricted by Section 5.14(a). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.14(b), nothing in this
Section 5.14(b) shall affect any restrictions contained in the Intellectual
Property Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Seller to give notice
to or obtain the consent of Buyer in order to engage in any business
combination transaction of the type described in the preceding sentence or
otherwise. In the event that Seller acquires ownership of or any equity
interest in any Person as described under Section 5.14(a)(iv) or in the event
that Seller is part of a business combination transaction as described in this
Section 5.14(b), Seller and the Acquiror will refrain from using or employing
in any way any of Seller's names, trade names, trademarks, service names,
service marks, brands or any mark or name or reference associated with
"Lucent," "Lucent Technologies," "Bell Labs," the Lucent Innovation Ring logo
or other similar mark in connection with any business or other endeavor of a
kind currently being conducted by Seller or its Subsidiaries through their
ownership of OFS, the Business or the Purchased Assets for two (2) years after
the Closing Date.

<PAGE>


               (b) Buyer shall form foreign Subsidiaries (as required by the
applicable Third Party Lease or applicable law) to enter into Lease
Assignments with respect to foreign Assumed Leases, guaranty the performance
of the Assumed Liabilities under the Assumed Leases and provide any financial
or other information reasonably required by the landlords under the Assumed
Leases. Seller shall request estoppel certificates from landlords in
connection with its requests for consent to the assignment of material Assumed
Leases and shall provide any estoppel certificates it receives to Buyer upon
receipt and in any event at or prior to Closing.

               (c) Between the date hereof and the Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate the Lease Agreements contemplated by Schedule 3.7(b) in good
faith based on the form of Lease Agreement annexed hereto as Exhibit F and the
following principles:

                    (i) the "basic rent" payable under each Lease Agreement
shall be the "Net Rent" set forth for such Lease Agreement on Schedule 3.7(b);

                    (ii) the sum of (A) the "Total" of the charges for Core
Property Management and Core Administrative Services, including all charges
for parking, and (B) the "Other Sq. Ft. Charges", including all charges for
furniture, fixtures and/or equipment ("FFE") not carried on the Balance Sheet
(it being understood that any FFE carried on the Balance Sheet is included in
the Purchased Assets and shall be conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this
transaction), in each case to be set forth on Exhibit D to each Lease shall be
equal to the "Oper. Rent" set forth for such Lease Agreement on Schedule
3.7(b), and there will be no other charges for parking or the rental of FFE,
and Buyer will have the right to remove all FFE which is carried on the
Balance Sheet in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreements and the
Sublease;

                    (iii) the "Usage Rates" to be set forth on Exhibit D to
each Lease Agreement shall be equal to the Usage Rates established by Seller
or the applicable Subsidiary at the Owned Real Property to which such Lease
Agreement relates and charged to other tenants, if any, and backcharged to the
divisions of Seller or the applicable Subsidiary at such Owned Real Property
as of the date of Closing;

                    (iv) the term of each Lease Agreement shall be the term
for such Lease Agreement set forth on Schedule 3.7(b);

                    (v) the premises to be demised by each Lease Agreement
shall be the premises actually occupied by OFS during the three month period
immediately prior to the date hereof, Buyer and Seller acknowledging that the
square footage of the premises to be demised by the Lease Agreements set forth
on Schedule 3.7(b) may have to be adjusted based on an audit of the space
actually occupied by OFS which is currently underway;

                    (vi) notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement, (A) the forms of the Lease Agreements for the Owned Real Property
located in Murray Hill and Whippany, New Jersey shall (1) be converted into
sublease agreements upon the terms set forth in this Section 5.15 and (2)
shall provide for the Lease Agreements to be subject and subordinate to the
existing mortgages and underlying leases encumbering such Owned Real Property
and (B) any modifications requested by Buyer to the form of Lease Agreement
for such Owned Real Property, other than the modifications provided for in
this Section 5.15(c), shall be subject to the

                                      65


<PAGE>


approval of the holder of such existing mortgages and the landlord under such
underlying leases (collectively, the "Mortgage Lender") to the extent that
such approval is required under such mortgages, leases and related documents
(the "Financing Documents"), and neither Seller nor any Subsidiary shall be
obligated to approve or consent to any modifications to such form of Lease
Agreement for either such Owned Real Property that have not been approved by
the Mortgage Lender to the extent so required, it being the intention of the
parties that any Subsidiary which is the landlord under such an underlying
lease shall not have an independent right to approve or consent to any such
modifications if the Financing Documents permit Seller or such Subsidiary to
approve or consent to such modifications without the consent of the holder of
the mortgage or an "independent" manager or director required by the terms of
the Financing Documents;

                    (vii) subject to the receipt of the consent of the
Mortgage Lender as to the Lease Agreements with respect to the Owned Real
Property located in Murray Hill and Whippany, New Jersey, (A) the Lease
Agreements will provide that to the extent that the landlord under a Lease
Agreement exercises any rights it may have to curtail or limit the services
provided to the tenant under such Lease Agreement, the form of Lease Agreement
will require it to curtail or limit the services it provides to Seller and/or
divisions of Seller located from time to time and to the other tenants
currently located at the Owned Real Property to which the Lease Agreement
relates in the same manner, (B) the Lease Agreements will provide that the
landlord may not refuse to approve subleases to CommScope, the Fiber JV and
the Cable JV which are consistent with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (C) the Lease Agreements will not require the tenant to restore
the premises demised thereunder to a condition which existed prior to the
commencement of the Lease Agreement, provided that the Lease Agreements may
require the tenant to assume restoration obligations with respect to tenant
improvements or alterations made during the term of the Lease Agreements and
to repair damage arising from the removal of trade fixtures by the tenant,
including any trade fixtures which were located within the premises demised by
the Lease Agreement prior to the commencement of the Lease Agreement,
provided, however, that if the Mortgage Lender does not consent to the
modification described in clause (C) above for the Lease Agreements relating
to Murray Hill and Whippany, New Jersey, then Seller shall indemnify, defend
and hold Buyer harmless from and against all costs, expenses and other Losses
that Buyer would have avoided if the Mortgage Lender had granted such consent,
provided further that the foregoing indemnification obligation of Seller shall
(1) survive the Closing hereunder, and (2) not be subject to the limitations
or restrictions on Seller's indemnification obligations set forth in Section
9.3 of this Agreement, including those set forth in Section 9.3(g) hereof.

                    (viii) the form of Lease Agreement annexed hereto as
Exhibit F will be modified as may reasonably be required for the Owned Real
Property located in Campinas, Brazil in order to conform it to the law of and
real estate custom and practice in Brazil in a manner which places Buyer and
Seller in a position as close as is practicable to the economic and legal
position Buyer and Seller would be in if such Owned Real Property were located
in the United States;

                    (ix) the parties will also negotiate environmental health
and safety agreements for each Lease Agreement, the parties agreeing that it
is important to establish

                                      66


<PAGE>


procedures and protocols which will ensure compliance with all applicable
environmental, health and safety laws, orders, rules and regulations
applicable to the premises to be demised by the Lease Agreements; and

                    (x) the form of Lease Agreement annexed hereto as Exhibit
F and the form of Sublease annexed hereto as Exhibit E will be modified for
any applicable Owned Real Property or the Applicable Third Party Lease to be
subject to such Lease Agreement or Sublease, to contain any other
modifications or revisions as may be requested by Buyer or Seller if such
modifications or revisions are reasonable and customary in arm's length leases
or subleases in the applicable geographical region for similar properties
subject to leases or subleases of similar duration and under which similar
rents are payable.

               (d) Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that:

                    (i) the "Oper. Rents" set forth on Schedule 3.7(b) are
based on 100% of the actual and/or reasonably budgeted costs of providing the
services described on Exhibit D to the form of Lease Agreement annexed hereto
as Exhibit F as determined and developed by Seller in accordance with Seller's
historical accounting practices and procedures and the "Proportionate Shares"
set forth or to be set forth in the Lease Agreements;

                    (ii) such Proportionate Shares are and/or will be
determined in accordance with a consistent standard of measurement such that
the sum of the Proportionate Shares applicable to each Owned Real Property is
substantially equivalent to 100%; and

                    (iii) the Mortgage Lender has approved existing leases in
substantially the form annexed hereto as Exhibit F in connection with the
underwriting of the financing/synthetic lease transaction involving the Owned
Real Property located in Murray Hill and/or Whippany, New Jersey.

               (e) Seller, with respect to the Owned Real Property located in
Murray Hill and Whippany, New Jersey, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to secure the approval and/or consent of the Mortgage Lender (to the
extent such approval or consent is required under the applicable Financing
Documents) to any changes to the form of Lease Agreement annexed hereto as
Exhibit F which are agreed upon by Buyer and Seller in accordance with this
Section 5.15 promptly after Buyer and Seller finalize Lease Agreements with
respect to such Owned Real Properties;

               (f) In the event that, prior to Closing, in the good faith
judgment of either party, Buyer and Seller have reached an impasse with
respect to any term(s) of the Lease Agreements, the environmental health and
safety agreement referenced above or the Sublease (the "Real Estate
Agreements") except for the premises, term, basic rent, operating rent
(including the CPI escalation provision contained in the form of Lease
Agreement) and any other term required to be included in the Real Estate
Agreements in accordance with this Section 5.15, such party may require such
term(s) to be determined by arbitration as hereinafter provided. The party
desiring arbitration shall give notice to that effect to the other party. The
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). The parties hereto shall
attempt to agree on a single arbitrator (the

                                      67


<PAGE>


"Referee"). The Referee must be an individual with at least ten years
experience as an executive with real estate responsibility for research and
development/manufacturing facilities at a manufacturing company comparable in
size to or larger than OFS (if it were a separate company). If the parties
cannot agree on the appointment of the Referee within 5 Business Days after
the giving of the notice requesting arbitration, either party may request the
AAA to appoint a Referee meeting the foregoing requirements. If the AAA shall
refuse to appoint such Referee or fail to do so within 5 Business Days of the
request, or if the AAA shall then no longer be in existence, either party
hereto, on behalf of both, may apply to the Supreme Court in the County of New
York for the appointment of such Referee, and the other party shall not raise
any objection as to the Court's full power and jurisdiction to entertain the
application and make such appointment. Within 7 Business Days after the
selection of the Referee, (1) the parties shall submit to the Referee their
respective resolutions of the dispute in question in the form of a written
provision or provisions to be added to or to replace an existing provision in
the applicable Real Estate Agreement, and (2) the parties may submit to the
Referee such evidence as they may deem relevant. Within 5 Business Days
following such 7 Business Day period, the Referee shall select either the
Buyer's or the Seller's resolution and give notice thereof to the Buyer and
the Seller. Under no circumstances may the Referee modify or disregard any
provision of this Section 5.15 and the jurisdiction of the Referee is
restricted accordingly. The Referee's decision shall be final, conclusive on
the parties and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the
applicable Real Estate Agreement shall reflect such decision and shall be
executed and delivered by Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary and
Buyer at the Closing. Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of such
party's attorneys and witnesses. The fees and expenses of the Referee and all
other expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the parties equally.

               5.16 WARRANTY CLAIMS AND RECALLS

               Buyer shall process and approve product warranty claims and
product recalls and perform warranty and recall work required after the
Closing for products sold or consigned by the Business on or prior to the
Closing Date in substantially the same manner as the Business did on or prior
to the Closing Date. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer for product warranty claims made against, or
recalls effected by, Seller or any Selling Subsidiary prior to the Closing
Date, and for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in respect
of product warranty claims, product recalls and warranty and recall work, in
each case with respect to products sold or consigned by the Business on or
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall submit a quarterly request to Seller
for reimbursement of such warranty and recall costs and expenses, together
with documentation evidencing the same, and Seller shall pay the amount due to
Buyer as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days after receipt of Buyer's request.

               5.17 CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS

               (a) Schedule 5.17(a) sets forth all Contracts, if any, that are
to be transferred and assigned to Buyer relating to contracts, purchase
orders, sales orders and arrangements, commitments, understandings and other
instruments relating to customers of the Business and which will require
performance, delivery or any further actions on the part of Seller or its
Affiliates on or after the Closing ("Continuing Contracts"). Buyer shall
administer all work

                                      68


<PAGE>


Related to the Business under such Continuing Contracts and Seller shall
perform all work required under such Continuing Contracts for all matters not
Related to the Business (including the manufacture and delivery of products
and goods and performance of services after the Closing Date) in substantially
the same manner as Seller and/or its Affiliates did prior to the Closing Date
or as may be required by the Continuing Contract; provided that Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with the foregoing. Seller shall submit a quarterly request to
Buyer for reimbursement of such costs and expenses, together with
documentation evidencing the same, in connection with such work and Buyer
shall pay the amount due to Seller as promptly as reasonably practicable, but
in no event later than ninety (90) days after receipt of Seller's request. If
any Continuing Contracts are identified by Seller after the date hereof,
Seller will promptly notify Buyer and will provide Buyer with a copy thereof.
Regardless of when, whether before or after the Closing, any Continuing
Contract is identified, Seller will comply with its obligations under this
Section 5.17(a) with respect thereto.

               (b) Not less than 20 Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of each Excluded Contract in which
Seller has agreed to sell, resell, procure or distribute fiber optic cable
and/or optical fiber (the "Retained Contracts"). Prior to Closing Date Buyer
may elect, in a written notification to Seller, that it intends to accept
certain responsibilities with respect to one or more Retained Contracts (each
of such Retained Contracts, an "Accepted Retained Contract"). With respect to
each Accepted Retained Contract, Seller shall administer all work not Related
to the Business under such Accepted Retained Contract and Buyer shall perform
all work required under such Accepted Retained Contract for all matters
Related to the Business (including the manufacture and delivery of products
and goods and performance of services after the Closing Date) in substantially
the same manner as Seller and/or its Affiliates did prior to the Closing Date
or as may be required by, and in accordance with the terms of, the Retained
Accepted Contract; provided that Seller shall, without further consideration,
pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to Buyer promptly all money,
rights and other consideration received by it in respect of such performance,
provided further, however, that whether before or after the Closing, in the
event an Accepted Retained Contract is amended (or any party thereunder waives
any rights thereunder), Buyer shall have the right to elect to receive the
money, rights and other consideration that would have been due under such
Accepted Retained Contact without regard to such amendment or waiver.

               5.18 COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS; SELLING SUBSIDIARIES

               (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith the schedules for the services to be attached to the Transition
Services Agreement to ensure that Buyer receives all services necessary to
operate the Business as currently conducted and as contemplated to be
conducted on an at cost basis for a reasonable transition period (not less
than six months following the Closing Date but not beyond December 31, 2002),
and shall negotiate in good faith the definitive agreements relating to the
other Collateral Agreements contemplated by the term sheets attached as
Exhibits hereto.

                                      69


<PAGE>

               (b) Seller shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries and the
Transferred Entities to perform their respective obligations under this
agreement, including executing and delivering the Collateral Agreements.

               5.19 RECORDING OF PATENTS

               Not later than August 15, 2001, Seller will record in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office, at its own expense, any assignment,
grant or conveyance, not previously recorded therein, by which it acquired
ownership or any right to convey from a Third Party any of the Assigned
Patents or the Jointly Owned Patents, as each such term is defined in the
Intellectual Property Agreement.

          6.   CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF INFORMATION

               6.1 CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

               Buyer agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
(a) all documents, materials and other information that it shall have obtained
regarding Seller or its Affiliates during the course of the negotiations
leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), any investigations made
in connection therewith and the preparation of this Agreement and related
documents and (b) all analyses, reports, compilations, evaluations and other
materials prepared by Buyer or its counsel, accountants or financial advisors
that contain or otherwise reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, such
information; provided, however, that subject to Section 6.2(a), the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of the Closing and shall be of no
further force and effect thereafter with respect to any such information that
is Related to the Business.

               6.2 SELLER'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

               (a) Except as provided in Section 6.2(b), 6.2(c) or 6.2(d),
after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall treat as the property of Seller
and shall not disclose to any Third Parties (other than Buyer's advisors and
agents who receive the information in confidence) all Confidential Information
with respect to Seller's and its Affiliates' respective businesses (other than
the Business) that is received from, or made available by, Seller or an
Affiliate or employee or representative of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in
the course of the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, for purposes of this Section 6.2, Confidential Information
about Seller's and its Affiliates' business plans and strategies, marketing
ideas and concepts (other than as Related to the Business), especially with
respect to unannounced products and services, present and future product
plans, pricing, volume estimates, financial data, product enhancement
information, business plans, marketing plans, sales strategies, customer
information (including customers' applications and environments), market
testing information, development plans, specifications, customer requirements,
configurations, designs, plans, drawings, apparatus, sketches, software,
hardware, data, prototypes, connecting requirements or other technical and
business information, except for such Confidential Information as is assigned
or transferred to Buyer as part of the Purchased Assets, or otherwise in
accordance with this Agreement or the IP Agreements. Buyer shall not use the
foregoing Confidential Information of Seller for any purposes other than those
expressly authorized under

                                      70


<PAGE>

this Agreement nor disclose such information to any
other Persons except where reasonably required for the uses for which rights
are granted hereunder or as expressly permitted by this Agreement.

               (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Confidential
Information shall not be deemed confidential, and Buyer shall have no
obligation with respect to any such Confidential Information that:

                    (i) at the time of disclosure was already known to Buyer,
other than through the negotiation or consummation of this transaction, free
of restriction;

                    (ii) is or becomes publicly known, or is readily
ascertainable, through publication, inspection of a product, or otherwise, and
through no negligence or other unlawful act of Buyer;

                    (iii) is received by Buyer from a Third Party without
similar restriction or breach of any agreement actually known to Buyer;

                    (iv) to the extent it is independently developed by Buyer
or a Third Party; or

                    (v) is, subject to Section 6.2(c), required to be
disclosed under applicable Law or judicial process.

               (c) If Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is requested or
required in connection with any judicial or administrative proceedings (by
oral question, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information of Seller or its Affiliates, Buyer will promptly notify Seller of
such request or requirement and will cooperate with Seller, to the extent
legally permissible, such that Seller may seek an appropriate protective order
or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is on the
advice of counsel legally compelled to disclose the Confidential Information
or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Buyer
(or its Affiliate) may, without liability hereunder, disclose only so much of
the Confidential Information to the party compelling disclosure as is required
by Law. Buyer will exercise its (and will cause its Affiliates to exercise
their) reasonable best efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential
Information.

               (d) Except to the extent that disclosure thereof is required
under accounting, stock exchange or applicable Law (including the U.S. federal
securities laws), the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and all
attachments and amendments hereto and thereto shall be considered Confidential
Information protected under this Article 6. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article 6 to the contrary, in the event that any such Confidential Information
is also subject to a limitation on disclosure or use contained in another
written agreement between Buyer and Seller or a Selling Subsidiary (including
the IP Agreements) that is more restrictive than the limitation contained in
this Article 6, then the limitation in such agreement shall supersede this
Article 6.

                                      71


<PAGE>


               6.3 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION RELATED TO THE BUSINESS

               From the date of this Agreement until and after the Closing,
Seller agrees that it shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) keep
confidential any Confidential Information Related to the Business, and other
information that may be assigned or transferred to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, including information of the type
referred to in Section 6.2(a) but Related to the Business, subject mutatis
mutandis to the same terms and conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(b) through
6.2(d) with respect to the confidentiality obligations of Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of Section 6.2(b), Seller shall be
deemed not to have had knowledge or possession of any Confidential Information
referred to in the preceding sentence prior to the Closing.

agency shall be in effect that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes illegal
or otherwise prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, and there shall not be pending any
suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Body seeking to enjoin,
restrain, condition, make illegal or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements.

               (b) Antitrust Laws. Any applicable waiting period under the HSR

transactions contemplated hereby and in the Collateral Agreements shall have
been obtained or shall have occurred, other than such authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals the failure of which to have been obtained, and
such waiting periods the failure of which to have occurred, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial
or other) or results of operations of the Business, taken as a whole. With
respect to each Subsequent Closing, if any, all material authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals of, or material declarations or filings with, or

               8.2 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO BUYER'S OBLIGATIONS

at the Closing, of each of the following conditions, any of which conditions
may be waived in writing by Buyer in its sole discretion:

               (a) Representations and Warranties of Seller. The
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement or any
Collateral Agreement or in any schedule, exhibit, certificate or document
delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof or thereof or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be true and correct in
all respects (without regard to any qualifications therein as to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect) both when made and at and as of the Closing Date,
as though such representations and warranties were made at and as of the
Closing Date, except to the extent that such

                                      74


<PAGE>


representations and warranties are made as of a specified date, in which case
such representations and warranties shall be true and correct (to the extent
set forth above) as of such specified date, unless the failure of any such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, at and as of the dates set forth above, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) Performance by Seller. Seller and/or the applicable Selling
Subsidiary and/or Transferred Entity shall have performed in all material
respects all obligations and agreements and complied in all material respects
with all covenants and conditions required by this Agreement or any Collateral
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to or at the Closing,
including executing the Collateral Agreements.

               (c) Downgrade. There shall not have occurred a downgrade in the
credit rating of Seller (i) to any category or gradation below "B-" in the
case of a credit rating by Standard & Poor's Corporation, or (ii) to any
category or gradation below B3 in the case of a credit rating by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc.

               8.3 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SELLER'S OBLIGATIONS

               The obligations of Seller to effect the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the fulfillment, prior to or
at the Closing, of each of the following conditions, any of which conditions
may be waived in writing by Seller in its sole discretion:

               (a) Representations and Warranties of Buyer. The
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any
Collateral Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered pursuant to
the provisions hereof or thereof in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be true and correct in all respects
(without regard to any qualifications therein as to materiality or any similar
standard) both when made and at and as of the Closing Date as though such
representations and warranties were made at and as of the Closing Date, except
to the extent that such representations and warranties are made as of a
specified date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct (to the extent set forth above) as of such specified date,
unless the failure of any such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct, individually or in the aggregate, at and as of the dates set
forth above could not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

               (b) Performance by Buyer. Buyer or its assignees, designees or
nominees shall have performed in all material respects all obligations and
agreements and complied in all material respects with all covenants and
conditions required by this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it or them prior to or at the Closing, including
executing the Collateral Agreements.

               8.4 EFFECT OF CERTAIN WAIVERS OF CLOSING CONDITIONS

               If prior to the Closing any party (the "waiving party")
receives written notice from the other party of any breach or breaches by such
other party of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement and such other party acknowledges in writing

                                      75


<PAGE>


that the effect of such breach or breaches, individually or in the aggregate,
is a failure of any condition to the waiving party's obligations set forth in
this Article 8 and the waiving party proceeds with the Closing, the waiving
party shall be deemed to have waived such breach with respect to the matters
specifically identified in such written acknowledgement, and the waiving party
and its successors, assigns and Affiliates shall not be entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to Article 9, to sue for damages or to assert any other
right or remedy for any Losses arising from such condition or breach,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement on in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

               8.5 TRANSFERRED JV INTERESTS

               (a) Schedule 8.5 sets forth, with respect to each Business
Joint Venture, the parties' mutually agreed valuation of the Transferred JV
Interests with respect to such Business Joint Venture. The parties acknowledge
and agree that Seller may not be able to transfer and assign the Transferred
JV Interests or some portion thereof to Buyer at the Closing because of
existing contractual obligations of Seller or the applicable Selling
Subsidiary (or the applicable provisions of the joint venture agreement,
limited liability company agreement or other constitutive document of a
Business Joint Venture). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 2.3, if Seller is unable to transfer and assign the Transferred JV
Interests relating to any Business Joint Venture at the Closing, Buyer shall
be entitled to hold back a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the value of
such Transferred JV Interests as set forth on Schedule 8.5. If and when any
Transferred JV Interests with respect to which a portion of the Purchase Price
is held back by Buyer in accordance with the preceding sentence are
transferred and assigned to Buyer, Buyer shall pay Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. Dollars the amount held back with respect to such
Transferred JV Interests within five (5) Business Days after the date on which
such Transferred JV Interests were transferred and assigned to Buyer (each
such event, a "Subsequent Closing"); provided, however, that any Transferred
JV Interests that have not been transferred and assigned to Buyer by the first
anniversary of the Closing Date shall no longer be considered a Purchased
Asset for purposes of this Agreement and, as of such date, the Purchase Price
shall be deemed to be reduced by the value of such Transferred JV Interests as
set forth on Schedule 8.5.

                  (b) If any Transferred JV Interests are transferred to any
Third Party in accordance with the applicable provisions of any existing
contractual obligations of Seller or any Selling Subsidiary (or the applicable
provisions of the joint venture agreement, limited liability company agreement
or other constitutive document of any Business Joint Venture), then (i) if the
purchase price received by Seller is greater than the value of such
Transferred JV Interests as set forth on Schedule 8.5, Seller shall pay to
Buyer 50% of the amount by which such purchase price exceeds such value and
(ii) if the purchase price received by Seller is less than the value of such
Transferred JV Interests as set forth on Schedule 8.5, Buyer shall pay to
Seller 50% of the amount by which such value exceeds such purchase price. Any
payments required by the preceding sentence shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. Dollars within five (5) Business Days after written
notice from Seller is received by Buyer (with such written notice detailing
the material terms and purchase price with respect to any such Transferred JV
Interests); provided that such notice will be sent by Seller as soon as
practicable after the receipt by Seller of the purchase price with respect to
such Transferred JV Interests. Buyer shall be

                                      76


<PAGE>


entitled to participate in discussions between Seller and any Third Party with
respect to the transfer of any Transferred JV Interests from Seller to such
Third Party as contemplated by this Section 8.5(b). Any Transferred JV
Interests so transferred to any Third Party shall no longer be considered a
Purchased Asset for purposes of this Agreement and, as of the date of such
transfer, the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by the value of
such Transferred JV Interests as set forth on Schedule 8.5.

               (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
parties agree that, with respect to any Transferred JV Interests that are
transferred and assigned to Buyer at a Subsequent Closing, all of the terms
this Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to such Transferred JV Interests
from the date hereof through such Subsequent Closing as if such Subsequent
Closing were the "Closing" (as defined in Article 7) (including the covenants
contained in Section 5.2, the survival periods of representations and
warranties contained in Section 9.1 and all matters relating to Taxes,
provided that with respect to Interim JV Taxes, (i) Seller shall not be
responsible for Interim JV Taxes arising in the ordinary course of business
(but Seller shall be responsible for audit adjustments for Interim JV Taxes
and for any Interim JV Taxes resulting from any contest or other proceeding
and for any Interim JV Taxes for which Seller would have been responsible had
the Closing for such Business Joint Venture actually occurred on the Closing
Date), (ii) Buyer shall have the right to review and approve (or disapprove)
all Tax Returns relating to Interim JV Taxes, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and in no event shall be withheld to the extent the Tax
Return is in accordance with past practice, (iii) to the extent set forth
herein, Seller shall have the right to control audits and other contests for
Interim JV Taxes (for the avoidance of doubt, treating such Interim JV Taxes
as paid in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, which may be included in a Straddle
Period) and (iv) Seller shall not be entitled to any refund or credit of or
with respect to Interim JV Taxes (other than Interim JV Taxes paid by Seller
pursuant to this proviso).

          9.   Status of Agreements

               The rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller under this
Agreement shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

               9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties

                 The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and such representations
and warranties shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is
two (2) years after the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 shall terminate at
the close of business on the date that is three (3) years after the Closing
Date, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.9, 3.11,
3.22 and 3.23 shall terminate upon the date that is thirty days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (iii) the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5(a)
shall survive indefinitely. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability
whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties unless a
claim is made hereunder or an action of law or in equity is commenced prior to
expiration of the survival period for such representation or warranty.

               9.2 TAX INDEMNIFICATION

               (a) Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) and its assignees, designees and nominees, and each
of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents,
direct or indirect members, direct or indirect partners and representatives
and hold them harmless from all liability for (i) Excluded Taxes, (ii) Taxes
that would not have arisen but for a breach by Seller of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and then only to the extent appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, and (iii) the portion of Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 2.9 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller shall not indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities) or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, from any liability for Taxes to the extent
attributable (under a relative fault standard) to a breach by Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement.

               (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Transferred Entities to,
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents, direct or indirect members, direct
or indirect partners and representatives and hold them harmless from (i) all
liability for Taxes of the Transferred Entities or relating to the Purchased
Assets for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (except to the
extent such taxable period is a Straddle Period, in which case Buyer's
indemnity will cover only that portion of any such Taxes that are for the
Post-Closing Tax Period), (ii) the portion of Transfer Taxes for which Buyer
is responsible pursuant to Section 2.9 of this Agreement and (iii) all
liability for Taxes that would not have arisen but for a breach by Buyer of
its obligations under this Agreement and then only to the extent appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, from any liability for Taxes to the extent
attributable (under a relative fault standard) to a breach by Seller or its
Affiliates under this Agreement.

               (c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

                    (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes
("Property Taxes") of the Transferred Entities and relating to the Purchased
Assets allocable to the Pre- Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount
of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period;

                    (ii) the Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the
Transferred Entities and relating to Purchased Assets allocable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date; and

                    (iii) each Transferred Entity that is classified as a
partnership or "flowthrough" entity for (U.S. or non-U.S.) Tax purposes shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as if its taxable year ended at the
close of business on the Closing Date and Taxes attributable to the income and
gain of each such entity through the close of business on the

                                      78


<PAGE>


Closing Date (as determined in a reasonably practicable manner) shall be
considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

               (d) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the
rights and obligations provided for in this Section 9.2 shall survive until 60
days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation.

               9.3 GENERAL AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY

               (a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the other party hereto and any employee, representative, agent, director,
direct or indirect member, direct or indirect partner, officer or Affiliate of
such party and such party's named assignees, designees and nominees (each an
"Indemnified Party") from and against any and all Actions, liabilities,
obligations, losses, and damages, amounts paid in settlement, interest, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the
foregoing) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Party arising out of, resulting from or relating to (i) the failure of any
representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party contained in this
Agreement or any Collateral Agreement to have been true and correct when made
or as of the Closing Date as though such representation or warranty were made
at and as of the Closing Date, or at such different date or period specified
for such representation or warranty or (ii) the breach by the Indemnifying
Party of any covenant or agreement of such Indemnifying Party (including, in
the case of Seller, as a result of the action or failure to act of the Selling
Subsidiaries) contained in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement to the
extent not waived by the other party hereto.

               (b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and any other Indemnified Party of Buyer from and against any Losses incurred
or suffered by such Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or
relating to: (i) any of the Excluded Liabilities (other than Taxes indemnified
under Section 9.2); (ii) Seller's failure to comply with the terms and
conditions of any applicable bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar Laws of
any jurisdiction that may be applicable to the sale or transfer of any or all
of the Purchased Assets to Buyer (or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries),
notwithstanding the waiver contained in Section 2.8; and (iii) any liabilities
and obligations that are made the responsibility of Seller and/or any of its
Affiliates under Section 5.5.

               (c) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates from and against any liability which may arise as a result
of Buyer, any Transferred ubsidiary or Subsidiary of a Transferred Subsidiary
or any of their respective Affiliates or the Business being jointly and/or
severally liable on, before or after the Closing, under Code Sections 412,
4971 or 4980B, or ERISA Section 302, Title IV of ERISA or Sections 601 through
609 of Title I of ERISA solely by reason of being considered to have been an
ERISA Affiliate with Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates
or ERISA Affiliates.

               (d) Buyer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and any other Indemnified Party of Seller from and against any Losses incurred
or suffered by such Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or
relating to: (i) any of the Assumed

                                      79


<PAGE>


Liabilities; and (ii) any medical, health or disability claims of any
Transferred Employee relating to services rendered or benefits earned after
the Closing Date.

               (e) Amounts payable in respect of the parties' indemnification
obligations shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Buyer and
Seller agree to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts in
connection with the preparation of a supplemental Asset Acquisition Statement
as required by Section 5.4 and Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1060-1(e) as a result
of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the preceding sentence.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third-Party Claim, both parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony,
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and
appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith or as provided
in Section 5.1.

               (f) In the case of a specific Loss giving rise to
indemnification hereunder (other than any Loss which is itself a Tax or a Loss
in respect of a Tax), if an Indemnified Party shall receive any amount of
Insurance Proceeds or any other amount from a Third Party in compensation for
such Loss, or shall actually (and irreversibly) realize in cash any Tax
savings that would not have been so realized but for such Loss ("Tax Savings
Actually Realized") that reduce the overall impact of the Loss upon the
Indemnified Party (i) at any time subsequent to the actual receipt of a
payment in full of indemnification of such Loss hereunder, then such
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any such
indemnification payment made up to the amount of such Insurance Proceeds or
other amounts actually received or Tax Savings Actually Realized or (ii) at
any time prior to the receipt of any indemnification payment in respect of
such Loss hereunder, then the indemnification to be paid shall be paid net of
the amount of any such Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually received
or Tax Savings Actually Realized. The amount of any indemnification payment
shall be increased by any Tax cost actually incurred in cash by the
Indemnified party that would not have been incurred but for an indemnification
payment hereunder. In computing the amount of any such Tax savings or Tax
cost, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising
from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence of any
payment of any indemnified Loss. Notwithstanding this Section 9.3(f), (x) in
no event shall any Indemnified Party be required (i) to take any action, or
forebear from exercising any right, under this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements or (ii) to take any action with respect to, make any demand under
or claim any coverage in connection with, any Policy, and (y) nothing herein
shall permit any Indemnifying Party to delay or refrain from making any
payment to any Indemnified Party because of the availability or alleged
availability of any Policy or Insurance Proceeds or Tax savings. The
indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Article 9 shall
inure to the benefit of the employees, representatives, agents, directors,
officers and Affiliates of the other party hereto on the same terms as are
applicable to such other party.

      (g) The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made
under Section 9.3(a) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims until the aggregate
amount of the Losses incurred shall exceed 0.5% of the Purchase Price,
provided that if such threshold is exceeded, the Indemnifying Party shall be

                                      80


<PAGE>


liable for all Losses starting from the first dollar of such Losses (without
giving effect to such threshold) and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's aggregate
liability for all such claims shall not exceed 50% of the Purchase Price. The
Indemnified Party may not make a claim for indemnification under Section
9.3(a) for breach by the Indemnifying Party of a particular representation or
warranty after the expiration of the survival period specified in Section 9.1.
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 9.3(g), the limitations
provided in this Section 9.3(g) shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or
covenant contained herein (iii) any claim for breach of those representations
and warranties set forth in the third, fourth and fifth sentences of Section
3.2 or (iv) any claim for breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in Section 3.22 or Section 3.23.

               (h) The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for monetary damages
available to the parties to this Agreement for breach of any of the terms,
conditions, representations or warranties contained herein; provided, however,
this exclusive remedy for damages does not preclude a party from (i) bringing
an action for specific performance or other available equitable remedy for a
breach of a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any
Collateral Agreement or (ii) pursuing remedies under applicable Law for fraud
or intentional misrepresentation.

               (i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for special,
consequential, punitive or exemplary losses or damages; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party
in respect of all Losses (x) directly incurred or suffered from Third Party
Claims or (y) for lost profits, incidental or indirect losses or damages.

               (j) The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party
interest, calculated at the interest rate from time to time announced by
Citibank, N.A. as its prime rate, on any expenses or other amounts reasonably
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim or Third-Party
Claim made under this Article 9, starting from the later of (i) thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the Indemnified Party's notice
given pursuant to Section 9.5 and (ii) the date such expenses or other amounts
were incurred by the Indemnified Party and ending on the date on which the
Indemnified Party receives indemnity for such losses.

               (k) The rights to indemnification under this Section 9.3 shall
not be subject to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to
such Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification.

               9.4 PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS

               (a) Notices. If one party is responsible for the payment of
Taxes pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 (the "Tax Indemnifying Party"), and the
other party (the "Tax Indemnified Party") or its Affiliate receives notice of
any deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit,
dispute or other claim with respect to such Taxes (a "Tax Claim"), the Tax
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing
of such Tax Claim. If notice of a Tax Claim is received by the Tax Indemnified
Party but not given to the Tax Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period
of time to allow such party effectively to

                                      81


<PAGE>


contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable detail to apprize such party of the
nature of the Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Tax Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives) to
the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result
thereof.

               (b) Pre-Closing Taxable Periods. The Seller shall assume and
control (including as to settlements) all proceedings taken in connection with
a Tax Claim for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date
(including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in
its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative proceedings
with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole
discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the Tax
Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that to the extent the Tax
Claim relates to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Transferred
Entities or is a Tax Claim for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) may be liable, (i) Buyer shall be entitled to
participate fully (at Buyer's expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim, (ii)
the Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account
of each stage of such Tax Claim and a copy of all documents (or portions
thereof) relating to such Tax Claim which are relevant to any Tax for which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) may be
liable, (iii) the Seller shall consult with Buyer before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Claim that might adversely
affect Buyer and shall consult with Buyer with respect to any written
submissions in connection with such Tax Claim which are relevant to any Tax
for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
may be liable, (iv) the Seller shall defend such Tax Proceeding in good faith
and diligently as if the taxpayer whose Tax Return is at issue were the only
party in interest in connection with such Tax Claim, and (v) Buyer shall have
the right to participate in any conference with any Tax authority which is
relevant to any Tax for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) may be liable.

                  (c) Straddle Periods. In the case of a Tax Claim for a
Straddle Period of a Transferred Entity or for Straddle Period Taxes
attributable to the Purchased Assets, Buyer (if the claim for Taxes that are
not Excluded Taxes ("Assumed Taxes") exceeds or reasonably could be expected
to exceed in amount the claim for Excluded Taxes) or otherwise the Seller
(Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, the "Controlling Party") shall be
entitled to control (including as to settlement) all proceedings taken in
connection with the defense of such Tax Claim. In such case, (i) the other
party (the "Non-Controlling Party") shall be entitled to participate fully (at
the Non-Controlling Party's expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim, (ii)
the Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Claim and a copy of
all documents (or portions thereof) relating to such Tax Claim which are
relevant to any Tax for which the Non-Controlling Party (or any of its
Affiliates) may be required to indemnify the Controlling Party or any
Affiliate of the Controlling Party or may otherwise be liable, (iii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Claim that might adversely
affect the Non-Controlling Party and shall consult with the Non-Controlling
Party with respect to any written submissions in connection with such Tax
Claim which are relevant to any Tax for which the Non-Controlling Party (or
any of its Affiliates) may be

                                      82


<PAGE>


required to indemnify the Controlling Party or any Affiliate of the
Controlling Party or may otherwise be liable, (iv) the Controlling Party shall
defend such Tax Proceeding in good faith and diligently as if the taxpayer
whose Tax Return is at issue were the only party in interest in connection
with such Tax Claim, and (v) the Non-Controlling Party shall have the right to
participate in any conference with any Tax authority which is relevant to any
Tax for which the Non-Controlling Party (or any of its Affiliates) may be
required to indemnify the Controlling Party or any Affiliate of the
Controlling Party or may otherwise be liable. The costs and expenses of
conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned based
on the relative amounts of the claim for Excluded Taxes and the claim for
Assumed Taxes.

               (d) Post-Closing Taxable Periods. Buyer shall assume and
control (including as to settlement) all proceedings taken in connection with
Tax Claims for any taxable period other than any Tax Claim which the Seller is
entitled to control under Section 9.3(b) or (c); provided, however, that the
Seller shall be entitled to control (including as to settlement) except as
provided below that portion of any such Tax Claim for which it is reasonably
expected that the Seller will be required to indemnify Buyer hereunder. If the
Seller is entitled to control a portion of a Tax Claim pursuant to the
preceding sentence, then with respect to the portion of the Tax Claim under
the Seller's control (i) Buyer shall be entitled to participate fully (at
Buyer's expense) in the conduct of such portion of the Tax Claim, (ii) the
Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of
each stage of such portion of the Tax Claim and a copy of all documents (or
portions thereof) relating to such Tax Claim, (iii) the Seller shall consult
with Buyer before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Claim that might adversely affect Buyer and shall consult with Buyer with
respect to any written submissions in connection with such Tax Claim, (iv) the
Seller shall defend such Tax Proceeding in good faith and diligently as if the
taxpayer whose Tax Return is at issue were the only party in interest in
connection with such Tax Claim, (v) Buyer shall have the right to participate
in any conference with any Tax authority, (vi) the Seller shall not enter into
any settlement or compromise without Buyer's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be withheld unless the settlement or compromise could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer that is material and
(vii) Buyer shall be entitled to compel Seller to settle the issue or issues
under the Seller's control if Buyer believes in good faith (upon written
advise of outside counsel) that Seller has less than a 25% likelihood of
prevailing with respect to such issue (provided, however, that Buyer's right
to compel settlement with respect to any issue shall not be effective if the
Seller delivers to Buyer a written opinion from a neutral nationally
recognized law firm which concludes that Seller has at least a 25% likelihood
of prevailing with respect to that issue).

               (e) The Tax Indemnifying Party, the Tax Indemnified Party and
each of their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in contesting any Tax
Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon a reasonable
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any
material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax
Claim.

               (f) If the Tax Indemnifying Party has not assumed or maintained
the defense of a Tax Claim, or has failed to meet material deadlines imposed
by, or failed to attend material meetings with, the applicable Governmental
Body (and the Tax Indemnified Party could

                                      83


<PAGE>


reasonably be expected to be adversely affected), the Tax Indemnified Party
may (after reasonable notice to the Tax Indemnifying Party and the failure of
the Tax Indemnifying Party thereafter to properly pursue the Tax Claim) settle
such Tax Claim at the Tax Indemnified Party's sole discretion. Neither party
shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of a Transferred Entity for
a Straddle Period or Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets for a Straddle
Period without the other party's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld).

               9.5 GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR INDEMNIFICATION

               (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification (other than
for claims under Section 9.2 or 9.3 relating to Taxes, as to which Section
9.4, and not the remainder of this Section 9.5, shall govern) under this
Agreement shall promptly notify in writing the party against whom
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion (and
basis) of any claim, or the commencement (and basis) of any Action by any
Third Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a
"Third-Party Claim"), and will give the Indemnifying Party such information
with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability hereunder (unless and to the extent the Indemnifying Party has
suffered prejudice by such failure). The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party of the commencement of a Third-Party Claim, to assume the
defense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.
Furthermore, the Indemnifying Party shall have sole control of the settlement
of any such Third-Party Claim that (i) involves (and continues to involve)
solely money damages or (ii) involves (and continues to involve) claims for
both money damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that
cannot be severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims
asserted by the Third Party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental
to the claims for money damages. Failure by the Indemnifying Party to so
notify the Indemnified Party shall be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying
Party of its right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

               (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the
case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its
own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending,
as provided in this Agreement.

               (c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of
any Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to, or
enter into, any compromise or settlement of (which settlement (i) commits the
Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action or (ii) does not
provide for a full and complete written release by such Third Party of the
Indemnified Party), or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not
relate solely to monetary damages arising from, any such Third-Party Claim
without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

               (d) The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate fully in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial
activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect
of which indemnity is sought pursuant to this Article IX,

                                      84


<PAGE>


including, but not limited to, by providing the other party with reasonable
access to employees and officers (including as witnesses) and other
information.

          10.  Tax Matters

               10.1 Responsibility for Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns
and Amendments

               (a) For any Straddle Period of the Transferred Entities or
relating to the Purchased Assets, Buyer shall timely prepare and file with the
appropriate authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing
Date and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; provided
that Seller shall pay to Buyer, at least two Business Days prior to the date
any such Tax is due to the applicable Governmental Body, the amount owed by
Seller pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 with respect to the taxable period
covered by any such Tax Return. To the extent such Tax Returns relate to the
Transferred Entities or the Purchased Assets, they shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practice, shall not include any change in any
method of accounting, and shall not include any Tax election that is
inconsistent with past practice, in each case, except for a Permitted Tax
Action. Buyer shall (i) furnish each such Tax Return to Seller for its
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) at
least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return and (ii) shall
revise such Tax Return prior to filing (and file the Tax Return as so revised)
to reflect any good faith comments of Seller given to Buyer within 15 days of
Seller's receipt of the draft Tax Return (provided, however, that to the
extent that Buyer does not agree with Seller's comments, the parties shall
endeavor in good faith to resolve such disagreement and, failing that, the
Independent Accountant shall resolve the disagreement prior to the due date,
including extensions, and the Tax Return shall be filed in the manner
determined by the Independent Accountant).

               (b) For any taxable period of the Transferred Entities or
relating to the Purchased Assets that ends on or before the Closing Date,
Seller shall timely prepare and Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall timely
file with the appropriate authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed.
Seller shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent
that they relate to the Transferred Entities, all such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practice, shall not include any
change in any method of accounting, and shall not include any Tax election
that is inconsistent with past practice, in each case except for a Permitted
Tax Action. Any Tax Returns required by law to be filed by Buyer or a
Transferred Entity shall be furnished by Seller to the Buyer or the
appropriate Transferred Entity, as the case may be, for signature and filing
at least five days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns and the
Buyer or applicable Transferred Entity, as the case may be, shall promptly
sign and timely file any such Tax Return (provided, however, that neither
Buyer nor any Transferred Entity shall be required to file any Tax Return not
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, and provided further that signing
and filing a Tax Return in accordance with this Section shall not be
considered to be an acknowledgement that such Tax Return complies with the
requirements of this Agreement). Buyer and Seller agree to cause the
Transferred Entities to file all Straddle Period Tax Returns on the basis that
the Straddle Period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
unless the relevant taxing authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on
that basis.

               (c) Seller shall be responsible for filing any amended
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns of or with respect to the
Transferred Entities or the Purchased Assets for taxable years ending on or
prior to the Closing Date. To the extent such Tax Returns are of or with
respect to the Transferred Entities and could affect Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities), such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with past practice, shall not include any change in
method of accounting and shall not include any Tax election that is
inconsistent with past practice, in each case except for a Permitted Tax
Action. For those jurisdictions in which separate Tax Returns are filed by the
Transferred Entities, any required amended Tax Returns for such taxable years
shall be prepared by Seller in accordance with past practice, shall not
include any change in any method of accounting and shall not include any Tax
election that is inconsistent with past practice, in each case except for a
Permitted Tax Action, and shall be furnished to the Buyer or the Transferred
Entities, as the case may be, for signature and filing at least 30 days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, and the Buyer or applicable
Transferred Entity, as the case may be, shall promptly sign and timely file
any such amended Tax Return (provided, however, that neither Buyer nor any
Transferred Entity shall be required to file any Tax Return not prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, and provided further that signing and filing a
Tax Return in accordance with this Section shall not be considered to be an
acknowledgement that such Tax Return complies with the requirements of this
Agreement).

               (d) Seller shall procure that neither the affiliated group for
federal income Tax purposes of which Seller is the common parent, nor any
other combined, consolidated or unitary group of which any of the Transferred
Entities was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, shall, for the Tax
period ending on September 30, 2001 of the taxable year of Seller (for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes) file an election to amortize research or
experimental expenditures under Code Section 174(b) or Treasury Regulation
ss.1.174-4(b). Further, Seller shall procure that the affiliated group for
federal income Tax purposes of which Seller is the common parent shall not
file any election to relinquish the carryback period under Code Section
172(b)(3) or Treasury Regulation ss.1.1502-21(b)(3)(i), and shall carry back
any net operating loss for any Tax period ending on or before September 30 of
the taxable year of Seller (for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) that
includes the Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted under Code Section
172 and Treasury Regulations thereunder.

              (e) Seller shall not make an election pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-20(g) (or any comparable provision of state or local
Tax law) to reattribute to the consolidated group of which Seller is a member
all or any portion of any net operating loss carryover or net capital loss
carryover attributable to any of the Transferred Entities that is a domestic
corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

               10.2 COOPERATION

               Each of Seller, the Transferred Entities and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making
available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods.

               10.3 REFUNDS AND CREDITS

               Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred Entities or
relating to the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for
the account of Seller (except for any refund or credit resulting from a
carryback that is permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(ii)), provided that
Buyer shall be entitled to retain any such refunds that would otherwise be for
the account of Seller to the extent of the Tax cost to Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) of receiving such refunds. Any
refunds or credits of the Transferred Entities or relating to the Purchased
Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period, and any refund or credit resulting
from a carryback that is permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(ii), shall be
for the account of the Buyer. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Transferred Entities or relating to the Purchased Assets for any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer pursuant to Section
9.2(c) of this Agreement. Any non-U.S. Tax that is deemed paid in a taxable
period pursuant to Section 902 of the Code (or similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. law) or that is credited in a taxable period pursuant to
Section 901 of the Code (or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law)
shall be considered to be for such taxable period, regardless of when the
underlying non-U.S. Tax was actually paid or accrued. Buyer shall, if Seller
reasonably requests and at Seller's expense, file for and obtain any refunds
or credits, or cause the Transferred Entities to file for and obtain any
refunds or credits, to which Seller is entitled under this Section 10.3.
Seller shall procure that any request for any refund or credit for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period of or with respect to the Transferred Entities shall be
prepared in accordance with the past practice for the underlying Tax Return,
shall not include any change in any method of accounting and shall not include
any Tax election that is inconsistent with past practice, in each case except
for a Permitted Tax Action.

               10.4 SECTION 338 ELECTIONS

                Buyer shall not make an election under Section 338(g) of the
Code (or any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax law) with respect
to any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Subsidiaries
which, in each case, is not a U.S. corporation.

               10.5 TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS

                 Any Tax-sharing agreement or similar arrangement between
Seller, on the one hand, and any Transferred Entity, on the other hand, shall
be terminated with respect to the Transferred Entity prior to the Closing.

          11.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

               11.1 NOTICES

               11.2 EXPENSES

               Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party to
this Agreement will bear all the fees, costs and expenses that are incurred by
it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not
such transactions are consummated.

               11.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; MODIFICATION

               (a) The agreement of Seller and Buyer, which consists of the
Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement, the Collateral Agreements, the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto and the documents referred to herein
and therein, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the
parties and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, written or oral,
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

               (b) No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound
thereby, and in accordance with Section 12.3 or 12.4, as the case may be.

               11.4 ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT; SEVERABILITY

               This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without
the other party's written consent; provided, however, that Buyer may assign
(i) its right to acquire the Purchased Assets and obligation to assume the
Assumed Liabilities to one or more of its Affiliates, Subsidiaries, assignees,
designees or nominees, as contemplated by and subject to the restrictions set
forth in, Section 1.3, and (ii) this Agreement and any Collateral Agreement to
a purchaser or acquirer of substantially all of the Business or the Purchased
Assets, but any such assignment will not relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the successors and permitted assigns of each
party hereto. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and, in the
event that any one or more provisions are deemed illegal or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect unless the deletion
of such provision shall cause this Agreement to become materially adverse to
either party, in which event the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
arrive at an accommodation that best preserves for the parties the benefits
and obligations of the offending provision.

               11.5 GOVERNING LAW

               THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IRRESPECTIVE
OF THE CHOICE OF LAWS PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE OF NEW


                                      89

YORK, AS TO ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING MATTERS OF VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT,
ENFORCEABILITY, PERFORMANCE AND REMEDIES.

               11.6 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

               Buyer irrevocably submits, and Seller irrevocably submits, and
agrees to cause the Selling Subsidiaries to irrevocably submit to, the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and each
agrees that no such action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought by it or any of its
Affiliates except in such court). Buyer further agrees, and Seller further
agrees, and agrees to cause the Selling Subsidiaries to agree, that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such
person's respective address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding in New York with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Buyer irrevocably and unconditionally waives
(and agrees not to plead or claim), and Seller irrevocably and unconditionally
waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), and agrees to cause the Selling
Subsidiaries to irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and not to plead or
claim), any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or that any
such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

               11.7 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

               Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its
Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party (i) certifies that no representative of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it
and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
11.7.

               11.8 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS

               This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.


               11.9 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

               Upon signing of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall prepare
a mutually agreeable press release announcing the transaction contemplated
hereby. Except for such press release, neither Seller nor Buyer shall, without
the approval of the other, make any press release or other public announcement
(including statements to Business Employees) concerning the

                                      90


<PAGE>


existence of this Agreement or the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so
obligated by Law or stock exchange disclosure requirements (subject to Section
6.2), in which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or
announcement to be issued.

               11.10 NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

               Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall (a) confer on any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors, designees or assigns any rights (including Third-Party
beneficiary rights), remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement (except for Indemnified Parties as provided in Article 9),
or (b) constitute the parties hereto as partners or as participants in a joint
venture. This Agreement shall not provide Third Parties with any remedy,
claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of
those existing without reference to the terms of this Agreement (except for
Indemnified Parties as provided in Article 9). Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed as giving to any Business Employee, or any other individual, any
right or entitlement under any Benefit Plan, policy or procedure maintained by
Seller or Buyer. No Third Party shall have any rights under Section 502, 503
or 504 of ERISA or any regulations thereunder because of this Agreement that
would not otherwise exist without reference to this Agreement. No Third Party
shall have any right, independent of any right that exists irrespective of
this Agreement, under or granted by this Agreement, to bring any suit at law
or equity for any matter governed by or subject to the provisions of this
Agreement (except for Indemnified Parties as provided in Article 9).

          12.  TERMINATION AND WAIVER

               12.1 TERMINATION

               This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date by:

               (a) Mutual Consent. The mutual written consent of Buyer and
Seller;

               (b) Failure of Buyer Condition. Buyer upon written notice to
Seller if any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.2 shall
have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived in writing
by Buyer;

               (c) Failure of Seller Condition. Seller upon written notice to
Buyer if any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.3 shall
have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived in writing
by Seller;

               (d) Court or Administrative Order. Buyer or Seller, if there
shall be in effect a final, non-appealable injunction or order of a court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

               (e) Delay. Buyer or Seller, if the Closing shall not have
occurred by January 24, 2002; provided, however, that the party seeking
termination pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (e)

                                      91


<PAGE>


is not then in breach in any material respect of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

               12.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION

               (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 12.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no
effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its directors,
officers or stockholders, except for the obligations of the parties hereto as
provided in Article 6 and Sections 11.2, 11.9 and this Section 12.2, and
except that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Seller nor Buyer shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

               (b) Furthermore, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
as provided herein:

                    (i) Buyer shall return all documents and other material
received from Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or any representative of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller relating to the Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether obtained before or after the execution
of this Agreement, to Seller; and

                    (ii) Seller shall return all documents and other material
received from Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer or any representative of Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer relating to Buyer or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement, to Buyer.

               12.3 WAIVER OF AGREEMENT

               Any term or condition hereof may be waived at any time prior to
the Closing Date by the party hereto which is entitled to the benefits thereof
by action taken by its Board of Directors or its duly authorized officer or
employee; provided, however, that such action shall not be effective unless it
shall be evidenced by a written instrument duly executed on behalf of such
party by its duly authorized officer or employee. The failure of either party
to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed
to be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity
of this Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any right in or breach of this Agreement
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other right or subsequent breach.

               12.4 AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT

               This Agreement may be amended with respect to any provision
contained herein at any time prior to the Closing Date by action of the
parties hereto taken by their Boards of Directors or by their duly authorized
officers or employees; provided, however, that such amendment shall not be
effective unless it shall be evidenced by a written instrument duly executed
on behalf of each party by its duly authorized officer or employee.
