Liabilities of the Acquired Companies.

  

1.6 _Expense Payments by the Sellers_.  Section 1.6 of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter sets for certain items, services and other related matters
for which the Sellers hereby assume financial responsibility (the " _Section
1.6 Items_"). On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer the
Sellers good faith calculation of the cost of the Section 1.6 Items that the
Sellers have not already paid (the sum of such calculation being the "
_Expense Payments Amount_ "). This Section 1.6 shall not limit any obligation

divided by 365.

  

(d) The term " _Net Payment Amount_ " means a working capital assets and pro
ration net payment amount corresponding to the "Net Payment Amount" set forth
on Annex A, with such amount to be computed as of the close of business on
the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, in a manner
consistent as to line items, accounting principles, methods of allocation and
pro ration, and in all other significant respects, with the computation of
Net Payment Amount set forth in Annex A. Such amount shall be expressed as a
negative number if in favor of the Buyer or as a positive number if in favor
of the Sellers.

  

(e) The term " _Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount equal to the Tenant Note
Amount  _increased by_ the New Home Amount _reduced by_ the
Capital Expenditure Shortfall (if any) _reduced by_ the Stay Bonus Amount
_reduced by_ the aggregate amount of Assumed Indebtedness at the Closing and

1.8 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by the Buyer in

1.9 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

(a) The Sellers shall, no later than 20 Business Days prior to the expected
Closing Date begin preparing, and shall deliver to the Buyer no later than
ten Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, a statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth ARCs good faith estimate of
the Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ ") and each of the
components thereof. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in
consultation with the Buyer and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer.
Promptly upon the Buyers request, ARC shall make available to the Buyer and
its Representatives copies of any back-up materials used by ARC in
preparing the Estimated Closing Statement and such other materials as the
Buyer may reasonably request in connection with its review of the Estimated
Closing Statement.

  

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to ARC a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Buyers good faith determination the Adjustment Amount and
each of the components thereof. Promptly upon ARCs request, the Buyer shall
make available to ARC and its Representatives copies of any back-up materials
used by the Buyer in preparing the Closing Statement and such other materials
as ARC may reasonably request in connection with their review of the Closing
Statement.

  

(c) Within 30 days after ARCs receipt of the Closing Statement, ARC shall
deliver to the Buyer a written statement either accepting the Closing
Statement or specifying any objections thereto. If ARC does not deliver any
such objections within such 30 day period, the Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon all parties. If ARC does deliver such objections
within such period, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith for a
period of 15 days following the Buyers receipt of such objections to resolve
any such objections. If the parties are able to resolve ARCs objections
during such 15 day period, then the Closing Statement, as revised in
accordance with such resolution, shall become final and binding upon all
parties. If the parties are not able to resolve such objections during such
period, then any remaining disputes shall be resolved by a nationally
recognized accounting firm upon which ARC and the Buyer shall reasonably
agree (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to resolve any such disputes within 30 days after its appointment. The
resolution of such disputes by the Accounting Firm shall be set forth in
writing and binding, shall be within the range of dispute between the Buyer
and ARC and shall be conclusive upon all parties. Upon delivery of
such resolution, the Closing Statement, as modified in accordance with
such resolution, and the Adjustment Amount as modified in accordance with
such resolution and set forth therein (the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "),
shall become final and binding upon all Parties.  The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by the Buyer and the Sellers.

        

(d) Within three Business Days after the date on which the Closing Statement
becomes final and binding in accordance with Section 1.9(b), (i) if the Final
Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, ARC shall pay
cash in the amount of such shortfall to the Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Buyer at least
two Business Days prior to such payment; and (ii) if the Final Adjustment
Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Buyer shall pay
cash in the amount of such shortfall to ARC by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the ARC at least two Business
Days prior to such payment. Any such payment shall be made with interest at
the Prime Rate from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

  

1.10 _Calculation of Final Purchase Price_. The " _Final Purchase Price_ "
shall be the amount equal to the Initial Purchase Price _reduced by_ the
Expense Payments Amount, if any, and _reduced by_ the absolute value of
the Adjustment Amount, if the Adjustment Amount is a negative number.

  

1.11 _Closing_. The parties agree that the closing of the Transaction (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time, at the offices of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas,
New York, New York 10019-6064, as soon as practicable, but in any event not
later than the fourth Business Day immediately following the date on which
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature have to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied or
waived, or at such other date, time and place as the Parties may agree. The
date on which the Closing will occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ ," and the time at which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_." If the Sellers determine that such delay is
necessary to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in either Section
7.1(e) or 7.1(f), the Sellers shall have a one time option, by delivering
written notice to Buyer no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing

(a) The Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers the amount in cash equal to the
Closing Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank
account or accounts designated by the Sellers prior at least one Business Day
to the Closing;

  

(b) Each Seller shall deliver an Assignment Agreement to the Buyer
transferring all Acquired Company Interests held by such Seller to the Buyer,
in form and substance attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, an " _Interest
Assignment Agreement_ "), and duly executed by such Seller;

   

10  

   

(c) Each Seller shall deliver an Assignment Agreement to the Buyer
transferring all of such partys Acquired Assets to the Buyer, in form and
substance attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, an " _Asset Assignment
Agreement_ "), and duly executed by such Party;

  

(d) Each Seller, and the Buyer shall deliver a Trademark Assignment

_Trademark Assignment Agreement_ "), and duly executed by such Parties;

purpose of which is to, among other things, designate the services, support
and facilities use relating to the operation of the Retained Business that
the Buyer will provide to ARC and its Affiliates after the Closing Date, in
form and substance attached hereto as Exhibit D (the " _Transition Services
Agreement_ "), and duly executed by such Parties; and

determines, not less than 10 days prior to the Closing, that it would be
beneficial to transfer one or more of the Acquired Properties from its
current owner at the Closing to an entity designated by the Buyer, then
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in effecting such transfer;
_provided_ , however, that no such transfer shall (i) have the effect of
increasing the obligations or reducing the rights of the Sellers hereunder in
any respect greater than de minimis or increasing the costs or expenses of
the Sellers hereunder, including increasing the amount of any Taxes due by
the Sellers (unless Buyer pays such increased cost or expense including
attorneys fees, title fees and transfer taxes associated with such
transfers), (ii) reasonably be expected to impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms contemplated herein
or (iii) constitute a waiver of any condition to the transactions
provided herein.

  

1.14 _Delayed Acquisition Assets_.

  

(a) Subject to Section 7.2(g), if and to the extent that the transfer or
assignment from any Seller to Buyer of any Acquired Asset or any Acquired
Company Interest would be a violation of applicable Law with respect to such
Acquired Asset or Acquired Company Interest or otherwise adversely affect the
rights of the transferee thereunder as a result of the failure to obtain or
make any consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or filing required
to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than any consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or
filing in respect of Assumed Indebtedness (to which this Section 1.14 shall
not

        

apply), then the transfer or assignment to Buyer of such Acquired Asset or
Acquired Company Interest (each, a " _Delayed Acquired Asset_ ") shall
be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or
assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments
are removed and/or any required authorizations have been made or obtained,
but the Closing shall otherwise take place in all respects as provided for in
this Agreement and the Initial Purchase Price shall not be reduced.

  

(b) If the transfer or assignment of any Acquired Asset or Acquired Company
Interest intended to be transferred or assigned hereunder is not consummated
at the Closing as a result of such Acquired Asset or Acquired Company
Interest being a Delayed Acquired Asset, then the applicable Seller shall
thereafter, directly or indirectly, hold such Delayed Acquired Asset for the
use and benefit of Buyer (at the expense of Buyer), insofar as reasonably
possible.  In addition, to the extent not prohibited by Law, such Seller
shall take or cause to be taken such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer in order to place Buyer, insofar as reasonably possible,
in the same position as if such Delayed Acquired Asset had been transferred
as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to
such Delayed Acquired Asset, including possession, use, risk of loss,
potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed
Acquired Asset, are to inure from and after the Closing to Buyer. To the
extent permitted by Law and to the extent otherwise permissible in light
of any required consent or authorization, Buyer shall be entitled to, and
shall be responsible for, the management of any Delayed Acquired Assets not
yet transferred to it as a result of this Section 1.14 and the parties
hereto agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and
coordinate with respect thereto.

  

(c) If and when the consent or authorization, the absence of which caused the
deferral of transfer of any Acquired Asset or Acquired Company Interest
pursuant to this Section 1.14 is obtained, the transfer of the applicable
Acquired Asset or Acquired Company Interest to Buyer shall automatically and
without further action be effected in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the applicable Transaction Documents.

  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a list
identifying, in reasonable detail, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, the
Delayed Acquired Assets and the authorizations required therefore (
_provided_ that this provision shall be disregarded for purposes of Section
7.2(a) and Article IX).

  

(e) The parties hereto further agree that, assuming as set forth in Section
1.14(b) that all or substantially all of the benefits and burdens relating to
the Acquired Assets inure to Buyer, (i) any Delayed Acquired Assets referred
to in this Section 1.14(e) shall be treated for all income Tax purposes as
Assets of Buyer and (ii) neither Buyer nor Seller shall take, and each of
Buyer and Seller shall prevent any of their respective Affiliates from
taking, any position inconsistent with such treatment for any income Tax
purposes (unless required by a change in applicable income Tax Law or a good
faith resolution of a contest).

the Acquired Business with the Buyer as of the Closing.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Seller shall be required to

disclosure would, in such Sellers good faith determination, reasonably be
expected to, (1) waive any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (2)
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , that the Sellers shall inform the
Buyer when information is withheld pursuant to this sentence and the Parties

Section 5.5(a). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any

Section 5.5 and which the Board of Directors of ARC determines, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, make a Change in Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) (and subject to the terms
thereof); _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of ARC shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) unless ARC has: (A)
complied in all respects with this Section 5.5, (B) provided to the Buyer
four Business Days prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") advising the Buyer that the Board of Directors of ARC
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including
the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and
agreed that any material amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of any such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Superior Proposal and an additional three Business Day period), (C) provided
to the Buyer all materials and information delivered or made available to the
Person or group of Persons making any Superior Proposal in connection with
such Superior Proposal, (D) during such four Business Day period (or three
Business Day period in the case of an amendment), if requested by the Buyer,
engaged in good faith negotiations with the Buyer to propose amendments to
this Agreement such that any Alternative Proposal which was determined to
constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal, and (E) at
the end of such four Business Day period (or three Business Day period in the
case of an amendment), such Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to any
amendments to this Agreement that may be

        

proposed by the Buyer following a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of
the negotiations required by clause (D) or otherwise).

  

(e) ARC promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise the Buyer

inquiry and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or indication
or inquiry (including copies of any document or correspondence evidencing
such Alternative Proposal or inquiry). ARC shall keep the Buyer reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status (including any material
change to the terms thereof) of any such Alternative Proposal or indication
or inquiry.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit ARC or its Board of
Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
however, that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify
the effect that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this
Agreement and (ii) in no event shall ARC or its Board of Directors take, or
agree or resolve to take, any action that would constitute a Change in
Recommendation other than in compliance with this Section 5.5.

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than the
Buyer or one of its Affiliates for (i) a merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, asset sale or purchase, dissolution or similar transaction
involving ARC (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of ARC whose businesses or
assets account for 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of
ARC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (iii) any proposal for the
issuance by ARC of 20% or more of any class of its Equity Interests or (iv)
any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20%
or more of any class of Equity Interests of ARC or of the consolidated total
assets of ARC and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such
person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of
the common stock of ARC then outstanding (or of the Equity Interests of the
surviving entity in a merger or the ultimate parent of the surviving entity
in a merger), or all or substantially all of the Acquired Assets, which the
Board of Directors of ARC reasonably determines (after consultation with its
legal advisors and its financial advisors), taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and

        

other aspects of such proposal and the Person making the proposal, (i) to be
(A) more favorable to the stockholders of ARC than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement after taking into account the then outstanding
proposal of the Buyer (including any amendments to this Agreement proposed by
the Buyer pursuant to Section 5.5(d) or otherwise) and (B) reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms set forth in the proposal and (ii) for which
financing, to the extent required, is then committed or reasonably likely to
be obtained.

  

5.6 _Filings; Other Actions_.

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereto, ARC
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement.  ARC and the Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. ARC will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing.
ARC will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to ARCs stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC. ARC shall as promptly as practicable
notify the Buyer of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC
relating to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information should be discovered by any Party hereto which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties hereto and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by ARC with the SEC and disseminated by
ARC to the stockholders of ARC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement will be made by ARC (including documents incorporated by
reference therein) without providing the Buyer a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon; _provided_  that with respect to documents that
are incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement, this right to review
and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or to Buyer or its
Affiliates.

  

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, ARC shall (i) take all
action necessary in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law, its
charter and bylaws and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for
the purpose of obtaining the ARC Stockholder Approval (such meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _ARC Stockholder Meeting_ "),
and (ii) subject to Section 5.5(d), recommend to its stockholders approval
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Recommendation_
") and include such Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and subject to compliance with
Section 8.2, ARC, regardless of whether the

        

Board of Directors has approved, endorsed or recommended an Alternative
Proposal or has made a Change in Recommendation, will submit the Transactions
for approval by the stockholders of ARC at the ARC Stockholder Meeting.

  

5.7 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) (i) Not later than 10 days prior to the expected Closing Date, the Buyer
shall offer employment to each Company Employee, which offer of employment
shall be subject to the Closing occurring and shall include (A) a rate of
base salary or wages equal to 100% of the rate of base salary or wages in
effect with respect to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (B) amounts of cash incentive opportunities that are no less
favorable than those in effect with respect to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_  that with respect to each
such Company Employee who is an Inactive Employee as of the 10th day prior to
the expected Closing Date, such offer shall be made by the Buyer only if such
Seller Employee actually reports to employment with the Sellers on or prior
to the date that is 90 days following the Closing Date (or such later period
if required by Law) and is capable of performing his or her job duties as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with all accommodations, in
which case such offer shall be made within one Business Day following the
date on which such Company Employee so reports to employment. Each such
Company Employee who accepts such offer of employment shall commence
employment with the Buyer immediately following the Closing (or, in the case
of such Inactive Employees, as of the date immediately following the date on
which such employee accepts employment with the Buyer, if later) (as
applicable, the " _Employment Date_ ," and those Seller Employees who accept
employment with the Buyer are referred to as " _Continuing Employees_ ") and
for all purposes consistent with Law and except as otherwise expressly
provided herein such employment from and after the Employment Date, as
applicable shall be deemed to have occurred with no interruption or break in
service and no termination of employment. The Buyer shall not fire or
otherwise discharge any Continuing Employees other than for cause until 45
days after the Closing Date.

  

(ii) On and as of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide such additional
personnel information with respect to each Company Employee as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers
shall not be required to provide any information to the Buyer, the
transmission of which would violate any Law regarding the transmission of
personnel data, including the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability Accountability Act of 1996, the Personal Information Protection
and Electronic Documents Act and other legislation regulating the collection,
use and disclosure of personal information, each as amended and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

(iii) The Sellers shall remain solely liable (including with respect to any
severance costs and related liabilities) for any Company Employee who does
not become a Continuing Employee and shall be solely liable with respect to
an Inactive Employee for the period until such employee becomes a Continuing
Employee, and the Buyer shall

        

have no liability with respect to any such employee. The Sellers shall use
their reasonable efforts to encourage the Company Employees to accept the
Buyers offers of employment.

benefits (including without limitation health and welfare, severance and
retirement benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
provided to the Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (excluding for this purpose equity-based incentive programs).  Each
Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all purposes (other than for
benefit accrual for any defined benefit pension plan) for such
persons service with ARC and its Subsidiaries (or any other employer to the
extent credited by ARC) to the same extent recognized by ARC under the Seller
Plans prior to the Closing Date for all purposes under any analogous employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by the Buyer or
its affiliates (" _Buyer Plans_ ") in which Continuing Employees
participate following the Closing Date, except to the extent that giving such
service credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same
period of service, and except under any defined benefit pension plan. The
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive (or, in the case of
Insured Buyer Plans, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
third party insurance carriers to waive) all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and service requirements with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees under any Buyer Plan, other than limitations,
exclusions, waiting periods or service requirements that are already in
effect with respect to such persons and that have not been satisfied as of
the Closing under any Seller Plan immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
provide (or, in the case of Insured Buyer Plans, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its third party insurance carriers
to provide) each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year in which the Closing occurs
under any analogous Buyer Plan.

  

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Continuing Employees shall no
longer actively participate in the ARC Management Services, Inc. 401(k) Plan
(the " _Sellers Savings Plan_ "). The Buyer shall designate a tax-qualified

distributions" (as such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code). As
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, (x) the Buyer shall provide
ARC with such documents and other information as ARC shall reasonably request
to assure itself that the Buyers Savings Plan is tax-qualified and provides
for the receipt of eligible rollover

        

distributions and (y) ARC shall provide the Buyer with such documents and
other information as the Buyer shall reasonably request to assure itself that
the accounts of the Continuing Employees would qualify as eligible rollover
distributions. Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Sellers
Savings Plan shall be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his
or her account balance and shall be given the opportunity to elect a "direct
rollover" in accordance with Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of the
participants such account balance to the Buyers Savings Plan, subject to
and in accordance with the provisions of such plan and applicable Law.  ARC
shall provide the Buyer with copies of such personnel and other records
pertaining to the Continuing Employees and such records of any agent
or representative of ARC pertaining to the Continuing Employees and such
records of any agent or representative of ARC, in each case pertaining to the
Sellers Savings Plan and as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to
administer and manage the accounts and assets rolled over to the Buyers
Savings Plan.

  

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but not later
than ten Business Days following the date hereof, the Sellers shall deliver
to the Buyer a true and complete list of all Company Employees and shall
allow the Buyer to inspect the personnel files and other documentation
relating to the Company Employees only to the extent legally permissible by
applicable Law.

  

(e) No provision of this Section 5.7 shall be construed as (i)
prohibiting Buyer and its Affiliates from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee for any reason following the Closing Date, (ii)
prohibiting the Buyer and its Affiliates from modifying or terminating any
employee benefit plan, program agreement or arrangement in accordance with
its terms and applicable Law or (iii) creating any third party beneficiary
rights in any Continuing Employee.

  

(f) The Parties agree that the Sellers may award "Stay Bonuses" of up to $4
million to Company Employees between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
_provided_ that the identity of the recipients and the amount payable to each
recipient shall be subject to the consent of the Buyer (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld).  Any such Stay Bonus shall be payable by the Buyer
upon the completion of 90 days following the Closing and shall not be paid to
any Company Employee who does not accept an offer of employment by the Buyer
or who terminates such Company Employees employment with the Buyer prior to
90 days following the Closing. The term " _Stay Bonus Amount_ " means the
amount by which the aggregate amount of Stay Bonuses paid to
Company Employees exceeds the sum of (a) 50% of the aggregate amount of Stay
Bonuses paid to Company Employees other than Company Employees that are
employed at properties that are marketed by the Buyer pursuant to Section 5.4
_plus_  (b) 100% of the aggregate amount of Stay Bonuses paid to Company
Employees that are employed at properties that are marketed by the Buyer

Taxes and the indemnification with respect to Taxes (and not be subject
to Article IX). The representations and warranties contained in Section 3.8

willful breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants in this
Agreement or as provided for in the Farallon Guarantee, in which case the
aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law
or in equity.

  

8.2 _Termination Fees_.

  

(a) (i) If this Agreement is terminated (x) by ARC pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(iii) or (y) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) or, following
a Change in Recommendation, pursuant to any other provision of Section 8.1,
then in any such event

        

described in clause (x) or (y), ARC shall pay to the Buyer a termination fee
of $20 million in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus an amount equal to
all of the fees and expenses of the Buyer, its contemplated transaction
partners and its and their Representatives, including fees and expenses of
financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts and
consultants, incurred by the Buyer, its contemplated transaction partners and
its and their Representatives in connection with the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, up to a maximum of $5 million (the " _Buyer
Expenses_ ").

  

(ii) If (A) an Alternative Proposal that reasonably appears to be bona fide
shall have been made known to ARC or shall have been made directly to its
stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) to make an Alternative
Proposal that reasonably appears to be bona fide and thereafter and (B) this
Agreement is terminated (x) by ARC or the Buyer pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) (so long as the Alternative Proposal was publicly disclosed and
not withdrawn at the time of ARC Stockholder Meeting) or (y) by ARC pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i) (in each case, other than a termination giving rise to a
right of Buyer to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)),
then ARC shall pay to the Buyer the Buyer Expenses.

  

(iii) If, following a termination of this Agreement giving rise to an
obligation of ARC to pay the Buyer Expenses pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii),
ARC enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a
transaction contemplated by any Alternative Proposal (provided that for
purposes of this Section 8.2(a)(iii), the references to "20%" in the
definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%")
within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated, then ARC
will pay to the Buyer the Termination Fee.

  

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall ARC be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by ARC pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i),
Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(ii) and, at the time of termination, all
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (other
than any condition the failure of which to be satisfied has been proximately
caused by the breach of this Agreement by the Buyer and conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at Closing and which were, at the time of
termination, capable of being satisfied), then:

  

(i) if, at the time of such termination, the lender under the Debt Financing
Commitment has failed to fund the Debt Financing contemplated thereby, the
Buyer shall pay to ARC a termination fee of $37.5 million (the " _Debt Event
Buyer Termination Fee_ "); or

        

(ii) if, at the time of such termination, the financing party under the Third
Party Equity Commitment has failed to fund the Equity Financing contemplated
thereby, the Buyer shall pay to ARC a termination fee of $50 million (the "
_Equity Event Buyer Termination Fee_ " and each of the Equity Event Buyer
Termination Fee and the Debt Event Buyer Termination Fee being referred to as
the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ ").

  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Buyer be required to
pay both the Equity Event Buyer Termination Fee and the Debt Event Buyer
Termination Fee or to pay a Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
but if both the Equity Event Buyer Termination Fee and the Debt Event Buyer
Termination Fee are due, then only the Equity Event Buyer Termination Fee
shall be due.

  

(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iii) shall be
made to the Buyer promptly following the earlier of the execution of a
definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any transaction
contemplated by an Alternative Proposal (and in any event not later than two
Business Days after delivery to ARC of notice of demand for payment); any
payment required to be made pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(a)(ii) shall
be made to the Buyer promptly following the termination of this Agreement
giving rise to such right to payment (and in any event not later than two
Business Days after delivery to ARC of notice of demand for payment), and
such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account to be designated by the Buyer. In circumstances in which
Buyer Expenses are payable, such payment shall be made to the Buyer not later
than two Business Days after delivery to ARC of an itemization setting forth
in reasonable detail all Buyer Expenses (which itemization may be
supplemented and updated from time to time by the Buyer until the 60th day
after the Buyer delivers such notice of demand for payment), and all such
payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account to be designated by the Buyer. Any payment required to be
made pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall be made to ARC promptly following
the termination of this Agreement by ARC giving rise to such right to payment
(and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the
Buyer of notice of demand for payment), and such payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated
by ARC.

  

(d) In the event that ARC shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or Buyer
Expenses, or the Buyer shall fail to pay the Buyer Termination Fee, required
pursuant to this Section 8.2 when due, such fee and/or Buyer Expenses, as the
case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such
fee and/or Buyer Expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate
equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of
New York from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending
Rate (the " _Prime Rate_ "). In addition, if either Party shall fail to pay
such fee and/or Buyer Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the such owing
Party shall also pay to the owed Party all of the owed Partys costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee and/or Buyer Expenses, as the case may be, the Buyer and
ARC acknowledges that the fees, Buyer Expense reimbursement and the
other provisions of this

        

Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transaction and that, without these
agreements, the Buyer and the Sellers would not enter into this Agreement.

  

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that none of the Termination Fee, the Buyer Termination
Fee or the Buyer Expenses is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate the Buyer or ARC, as the case may
be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the last sentence of this Section 8.2(e): (i) ARCs right to receive payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2 or the guarantee
thereof pursuant to the Farallon Guarantee shall be the exclusive remedy of
ARC against the Buyer, the Farallon Guarantor or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, directors, Affiliates, officers or agents
for (x) the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transaction to be
consummated and (y) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities
suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and except with respect to payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 8.2, except as set forth in
Section 8.2(d), neither the Buyer nor its stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officers or agents, as the case may be, shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by hereby (except that the Buyer also shall be
obligated with respect to the provisions of this Section 8.2, it being
understood that no other Person shall have any liability or obligation under
or with respect to such provisions); and (ii) Buyers right to receive
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Buyer against the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or
any of their respective stockholders, partners, members, directors,
Affiliates, officers or agents for (x) the loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transaction to be consummated and (y) any other losses,
damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and except with respect
to payment of he Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 8.2, except
as set forth in Section 8.2(d), neither the Sellers, the Acquired Companies
nor any of their Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, directors,
officers or agents, as the case may be, shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except that the Sellers also shall be obligated with
respect to the provisions of this Section 8.2, it being understood that no
other Person shall have any liability or obligation under or with respect to
such provisions).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as provided in,
and subject to the limitations of, the Farallon Guarantee, the payment of the
Termination Fee, the Buyer Termination Fee or the Buyer Expenses will not
relieve any party hereto of liability for willful breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement.

Party_ " and a party against whom such claims are asserted under this Article
IX shall be, for the purposes of this Agreement, referred to as an "
_Indemnifying Party_." All claims by any Indemnified Party under this
Article IX shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

        

(b) In the event that (i) any action, application, suit, demand, claim or
legal, administrative, arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
proceeding, hearing or investigation (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") is asserted
or instituted by any Person other than the Parties or their Affiliates which
could give rise to Damages for which an Indemnifying Party could be liable to
an Indemnified Party under this Agreement (such Proceeding, a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall
have a claim to be indemnified by any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement
which does not involve a Third Party Claim (such claim, a " _Direct Claim_ "
and, together with Third Party Claims, " _Claims_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall, promptly after it becomes aware of a Third Party Claim, or
determines that there exists a reasonable basis for a Direct Claim, send to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such Claim
and the amount or estimated amount thereof (which amount or estimated amount
shall be made without prejudice to the parties rights and shall not be
conclusive of the final amount, if any, of such Claim) (a " _Claim Notice_
"), together with copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) served on or received by the Indemnified Party in the case of a Third
Party Claim, _provided_  that a delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Article IX except to the extent of any incremental damage or liability the
Indemnifying Party shall have incurred as a result of such failure to give
such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
obligations under this Article IX to the extent of such incremental damage or
liability.

  

(c) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim and
be entitled to appoint counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice (but
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party in connection with such
Proceeding; _provided_  that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) the
Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any Indemnified
Party, (iii) the Third Party Claim, if determined in favor of the claimant,
would result in Damages in excess of the amounts available for
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX or (iv) the Indemnified Party has
not, prior to the assumption of such defense, acknowledged that such Third
Party Claim is subject to indemnification under this Article IX.  If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel in connection with such
Third Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel only if (i) the use of
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party
would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not have engaged counsel to represent the
Indemnified Party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of
such Third Party Claim. Nothing in this Section 9.3(c) shall require the
Indemnifying Party to be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) at any time in connection with
the defense against a Third Party Claim. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in defending and contesting any
Proceeding which the Indemnifying Party defends, or, if appropriate and
related to the Proceeding in question, in making any counterclaim against the
person asserting 

        

the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person. No Third
Party Claim may be settled or compromised (i) by the Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or (ii) by the Indemnifying
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless, in the case
of this clause (ii), the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement provides for a
full release of all Liability of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
Third Party Claim; _provided_  that, in no event will the Indemnifying Party
be permitted to settle any Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party
would not be entitled to assume the defense hereunder, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party
settles or compromises or consents to the entry of any judgment with respect
to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (except in the event the Indemnifying Party
unreasonably withheld or delayed its consent), such Indemnified Party shall
be deemed to have waived all rights against the Indemnifying Party for
indemnification under this Article IX with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

9.4 _Limitations on Claims_.

  

(a) _Liability Threshold for Buyer Indemnified Parties_.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Article IX to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a), unless and until
the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by such party for which
indemnification is available under Section 9.1(a), exceeds an amount equal to
$10,000,000 (the " _Liability Threshold_ "), and then, subject to Section
9.4(b), the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to the benefit of the
indemnity under Section 9.1(a) only for the portion of any and all Damages
that exceed the Liability Threshold.

  

(b) _Maximum Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the
contrary, the aggregate amount of the Sellers liability pursuant to Section
9.1(a) shall not exceed $100,000,000.

  

(c) _Additional Limitations_.

  

(i) The amount of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party shall be
reduced by the net amount the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
recovers (after deducting all attorneys fees, expenses and other costs of
recovery) from any insurer or other party liable for such Damages (other than
any Seller). The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to effect any such recovery.

  

(ii) Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

   

66  

   

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except to the extent provided in Article VI, from
and after the Closing, the indemnities provided for in this Article IX shall
be the exclusive remedies of the Parties and their respective officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns for money damages in respect of any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty or breach of or noncompliance with any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and the Parties shall not be entitled
to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification or other
rights or claims for money damages in respect thereof, all of which the
Parties hereto hereby waive; _provided_ , however, that the foregoing shall
not limit the right of any party to assert a claim based on fraud.

  

9.5 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. The Buyer and the Sellers
agree to treat any indemnification payment made under this Agreement, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, as an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price.

  

9.6 _Limitation on Damages_. No Party shall, under any circumstance, except
to the extent imposed by any Third Party Claim, have any liability to any
other Party for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages claimed by such other Party under the terms of or due to any breach
or non-performance of this Agreement, including lost profits, loss of revenue
or income, cost of capital, or loss of business reputation or opportunity.

  

9.7 _No Other Indemnification_. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party
shall have any indemnification obligations to any other party in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby except as set for in
Section 6.1, Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of this Agreement.

hereunder shall be joint and several obligations among the Sellers.

  

11.5 _Amendment; Waivers; Etc_. No amendment, modification or discharge

waiver will be effective against each Seller if executed by ARC.  Any such
waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter

granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. No waiver by
any of the Parties of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or
construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this
Agreement on any future occasion. No failure or delay to exercise any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver
thereof.

  

11.6 _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement (including the Buyer Disclosure
Letter and Sellers Disclosure Letter and Exhibits referred to in or delivered
under this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to their subject matters.

  

11.7 _Interpretation_.  Items disclosed on one particular section of the
Sellers Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter relating to one
section of this Agreement shall be deemed to be constructively disclosed or
listed in other sections of the Sellers Disclosure Letter or the Buyer
Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, relating to other sections of this
Agreement only to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
other sections of the Sellers Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure
Letter that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections of the
Sellers Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as the case may be.
The fact that

        

any item of information is contained in any disclosure letter shall not be
construed as an admission of liability under any applicable Law, or to mean
that such information is required to be disclosed in or by this Agreement, or
to mean that such information is Material. Such information shall not be
used as a basis for interpreting the term "Material,"
"material," "materially," "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect,"
or any similar qualification in this Agreement.

  

11.8 _Severability_.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the Parties agree that
the court making such determination, to the greatest extent
legally permissible, shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area
or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

  

11.9 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
via facsimile) in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument.

arises out of this Agreement, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to
this Agreement in any court other than the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or the courts of the State of New York, in
the City of New York. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the

shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial; Waiver of Immunity_.

  

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.

        

(b) Each Party agrees that in any legal action or proceeding against it or
its assets in connection with this Agreement, no immunity from such legal
action or proceedings (which shall include suit, attachment prior to
judgment, other attachment, the obtaining of judgment, execution or other
enforcement) shall be claimed by or on behalf of it or with respect to its
assets, irrevocably waives any such right of immunity which it or its assets
now have or may hereafter acquire or which may be attributed to it or its
assets and consents generally in respect of such legal action or proceedings
to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process in connection with
such action or proceedings including the making, enforcement or execution
against any property whatsoever (irrespective of its use or intended use) of
any order of judgment which may be made or given in such action
or proceedings.

  

11.13 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur to
Buyer in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not to
be performed by the Sellers in accordance with the specific terms hereof or
was otherwise breached and that Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
performance the terms hereof in addition to any other remedies at law or in
equity. The Parties acknowledge that the Sellers shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that
the Sellers sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall
be the remedy set forth in Section 8.2. The Sellers agrees that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and except as explicitly
provided in the Farallon Guarantee,(i) to the extent it has incurred losses
or damages arising out of the breach of this Agreement by the Buyer, (A) the
maximum aggregate liability for such losses or damages shall be limited to
the sum of the Buyer Termination Fee and the amount of interest accrued
thereon, if any, pursuant to Section 8.2(d), (B) in no event shall the
Sellers seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from Buyer
and the Farallon Guarantor, and (C) the maximum liability of the Farallon
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the express
obligations of the Farallon Guarantor under the Farallon Guarantee, and (ii)
in no event shall any Non-Recourse Party (as defined in the Farallon
Guarantee) have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

11.14 _No Right of Set-Off_.  The Buyer, for itself and its successors and
permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights
of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that the Buyer or
any of its successors and permitted assigns has or may have with respect to
the payment of the Final Purchase Price or any other payments to be made by
the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument
delivered by the Buyer in connection herewith.
