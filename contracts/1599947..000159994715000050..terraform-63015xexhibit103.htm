SALE OF ACQUIRED ASSETS AND CLOSING

2.01 Purchase and Sale.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Seller Parent agrees to cause the Seller to sell, transfer and
assign to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, all of
Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Assets free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

2.02 Payment of Purchase Price.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, in
consideration of the sale, transfer and assignment by Seller of the Acquired
Assets to Purchaser, the purchase price for the Acquired Assets shall be an
amount equal to the Cash Purchase Price and the amount of the outstanding
Credit Facility Obligations as of the Closing Date (which, for greater
certainty, shall be deemed to exclude any portion thereof that is discharged
using cash in the Reserve Accounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)) as confirmed
in the Payout Letter (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be
satisfied by the payment by Purchaser of the Cash Purchase Price and the
Credit Facility Obligations in accordance with Sections 2.03(b) and 2.04. 2.03 Closing.

(a) The closing of the transactions described in Sections 2.01 (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of McCarthy Tetrault LLP, counsel to Seller
Parent and Seller, at 1000 de la Gauchetiere Street West, Suite 2500,
Montreal, Quebec, H3B 0A2, or at such other place as the Parties mutually
agree, at 10:00 A.M. local time three (3) Business Days after the fulfillment
or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 and ARTICLE 9 (other than
conditions which, by their nature, may only be fulfilled on the Closing Date
or at Closing), or any other date mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the
Seller Parent. The effective time of Closing shall be at 11:59:59 P.M. EST on
the Closing Date.

(b) At the Closing, the following shall occur:

(i) Purchaser shall pay to (A) the Secured Creditors, on behalf of Seller, the
amount of the outstanding Credit Facility Obligations as of the Closing Date
as confirmed in the Payout Letter by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the payment direction set forth in the Payout Letter;
and (B) to the Seller an amount equal to the Cash Purchase Price payable at
Closing pursuant to Section 2.04(d) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Seller's account designated in writing by Seller Parent to Purchaser;
and

(ii) each Party shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other Party
the certificates and other deliverables pursuant to ARTICLE 8 and ARTICLE 9.

(c) In connection with the Closing, if the Debt Assumption Obligation is not
exercised, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
amounts in the Reserve Accounts to be applied to payment of the Credit
Facility Obligations and to reflect such application in the Payout Letter. The
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the Reserve
Accounts (including all cash therein) (if the amounts in the Reserve Accounts
are not applied to reduce the Credit Facility Obligations) and other Bank
Accounts to the Purchaser at Closing or as soon as possible thereafter or, if
it is determined at or prior to Closing that such transfer is not possible at
Closing or within a reasonable period of time thereafter, shall cause the
amounts in the Reserve Accounts and other Bank Accounts to be released to the
Purchaser at Closing or as soon as possible thereafter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Seller is unable to transfer the Reserve Accounts and other
Bank Accounts (including all cash therein) or release the amounts therein to
Purchaser by the date that is ninety (90) days following Closing, then Seller
shall pay to Purchaser, within five (5) Business Days thereafter, an amount
equal to the amounts in the Reserve Accounts and other Bank Accounts and upon
such payment Purchaser shall have no further right to the Reserve Accounts and
the other Bank Accounts or the cash therein and as and when such funds are
released, Purchaser shall direct such funds to be paid to Seller.

2.04 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Within forty-five (45) days following the Calculation Date, and in any
event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller Parent
shall deliver or cause to be delivered a balance sheet of the Seller as of the
Calculation Date prepared consistently with the Accounting Principles (the
"Calculation Date Balance Sheet") and a good faith calculation of the Purchase
Price Adjustment as of the Calculation Date (the "Calculation" and, collectively
with the Calculation Date Balance Sheet, the "Calculation Date Statement")
with all supporting work papers and other documents as are reasonably required
for an understanding of the Purchase Price Adjustment. The Calculation Date
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(b) Purchaser will be entitled to object to the content of the Calculation
Date Statement by delivering a written notice of objection to Seller Parent on
or before the 15th day following the date on which Purchaser will have
received the Calculation Date Statement. Any such objections by Purchaser will
be settled as follows: (i) Purchaser and Seller Parent will meet to try to
resolve Purchaser's objections by mutual written agreement; and (ii) if they
are unable to resolve Purchaser's objections by mutual written agreement
within a period of 15 days following Purchaser's written notice of objection,
then each of Purchaser and Seller Parent will be entitled to submit matters
that remain in dispute to the Independent Accounting Expert, who shall resolve
these disagreements in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the
provisions of this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall, and shall
cause their respective financial advisors to make available to the Independent
Accounting Expert all relevant information as may be necessary for the
purposes of resolving such disagreements provided that each Party and its
advisors (including accountants) shall have executed all release letters
reasonably requested in connection with the provision of any such information.
Each of Purchaser and Seller Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present its position to the Independent Accounting Expert.

(c) The Independent Accounting Expert shall be required to render its decision
in writing as expeditiously as possible and shall be requested, in any event,
to render its decision within sixty (60) calendar days from the date on which
the disagreements are submitted to the Independent Accounting Expert. The
Independent Accounting Expert shall consider only those items that were
identified by Purchaser and Seller Parent as being in dispute and shall, in
each case, assign a value to each such item that is equal to or in the range
between (but not above or below) the values asserted by Purchaser and Seller
Parent. The Parties will cooperate with each other and the Independent
Accounting Expert regarding the resolution of disputed items, such cooperation
to include reasonable access to books, records, facilities and personnel. Each
of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller Indemnitors in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share, on the other hand, shall be responsible for the
payment of one half of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Expert. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Accounting Expert
shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable
and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction
thereover. This provision shall constitute the exclusive remedy of the Parties
with respect to determination of the Calculation Date Statement, including the
Purchase Price Adjustment.

(d) The Parties agree that the Calculation Date Statement (as it may be
modified, as applicable, by the mutual written agreement of Purchaser and
Seller Parent or by any final decision rendered by the Independent Accounting
Expert under this Section 2.04) will become final and binding upon the Parties
on the first of the following dates to occur (the "Final Determination Date"):
(A) on the 15th day following the date of Purchaser's receipt of the
Calculation Date Statement, if Purchaser does not deliver a written notice of
objection to Seller Parent on or before such date; (B) on the date of the
settlement of all of Purchaser's objections by mutual written agreement of Purchaser and Seller Parent; or (C) on the date on which Purchaser and Seller
Parent receive a written copy of the final decision rendered by the
Independent Accounting Expert under Section 2.04(c). The Parties agree that:

(i) if the Final Determination Date occurs prior to the Closing Date, the Cash
Purchase Price payable by Purchaser at Closing pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i)
shall be the amount equal to the Base Purchase Price increased or decreased by
the Purchase Price Adjustment (depending on whether such Purchase Price
Adjustment is a positive or negative number) confirmed in the final and
binding Calculation Date Statement, and

(ii) if the Final Determination Date does not occur before the Closing Date,
(1) the Cash Purchase Price payable by Purchaser at Closing pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(i) shall be the amount equal to the Base Purchase Price
increased or decreased by the portion, if any, of the Purchase Price
Adjustment (depending on whether such Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive
or negative number) that is not subject to an objection of Purchaser in
accordance with Section 2.04(b) (the "Undisputed Portion of the Purchase Price
Adjustment"), and (2) (x) if the difference between the total Purchase Price
Adjustment confirmed in the final and binding Calculation Date Statement and
the Undisputed Portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive number,
Purchaser shall pay such difference to Seller within ten Business Days from
the Final Determination Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to Seller's account designated in writing by Seller Parent to Purchaser, or
(y) if the difference between the total Purchase Price Adjustment confirmed in
the final and binding Calculation Date Statement and the Undisputed Portion of
the Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, Seller shall pay such
difference to Purchaser within ten Business Days from the Final Determination
Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Purchaser's account
confirmed in writing to Seller. For greater certainty, any payment made under
Section 2.04(d)(ii)(2)(x) will be deemed to be an increase to the Cash
Purchase Price, and thus, will be deemed to be an increase to the Purchase
Price for Tax and all other purposes, and any payment made under Section
2.04(d)(ii)(2)(y) will be deemed to be a decrease to the Cash Purchase Price,
and thus, will be deemed to be a decrease to the Purchase Price for Tax and
all other purposes.

2.05 Obligation to pay Credit Facility Obligations. If, at any time prior to Closing, any Party has reason to believe (such belief
to be reasonable and in good faith) that it is likely that Purchaser will not
be able to perform its covenant pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i)(A), any Party
shall have the option (the "Debt Assumption Option"), by written notice to the
other Party, to elect that Seller shall sell, assign and transfer to Purchaser
at Closing all of Seller's rights pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and that Purchaser shall at Closing assume and agree to
timely perform and fulfill, from and after Closing, any and all Liabilities of
the Seller and its General Partner in connection with or pursuant to the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the Credit Facility
Obligations, in which case all such Liabilities shall be Assumed Liabilities
for all purposes of this Agreement. If any Party exercises the Debt Assumption
Option pursuant to this Section 2.05, the Parties agree as follows:

(a) the Purchaser shall not be obligated to make the payment pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(i)(A);

(b) the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 8.15 and 9.12 shall be
deemed deleted in their entirety and replaced by the following:

"(i) Purchaser shall have assumed and agreed to timely perform and fulfill,
from and after Closing, any and all Liabilities of Seller and its General
Partner in connection with or pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, including the Credit Facility Obligations, (ii) the Secured
Creditors shall have consented to the assignment to and assumption by the
Purchaser of all rights and Liabilities of Seller and its General Partner in
connection with or pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, including the Credit Facility Obligations, and (iii) Seller, its
partners (including its General Partner) and their Affiliates shall have been
released from any and all Liabilities in connection with or pursuant to the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the Credit Facility
Obligations and all related Support and Affiliate Obligations, and any and all
Liens charging their property in connection with the Credit Facility
Obligations (it being understood, however, that such Liens will be discharged
as soon as possible after Closing), on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Seller Parent;"

(c) the fees and expenses of the Secured Creditors to be paid and assumed by
the Purchaser pursuant to Section 15.06(b)(i) shall also include the fees and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses) of the Secured Creditors incurred
in connection with the negotiation of the assignment and assumption, the
consent and the release of any and all Liabilities in connection with or
pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the
Credit Facility Obligations, and of the Secured Creditors' Liens (and matters
incidental thereto) described in Section 2.05(b);

(d) the Permitted Liens described in clause (viii) of the definition of
Permitted Liens shall include any Liens created by the Financing Documents, it
being understood, however, that such Liens will remain registered at the
registration system of the Personal Property Security Act (Ontario) and the
applicable land registry at Closing only until the appropriate discharges have
been registered and processed in accordance with the instructions of and as
authorized by the Secured Creditors in connection with the assignment and assumption described in
Section 2.05(b)(i), and will be Permitted Liens only to the extent they are
released promptly following Closing in accordance with the instructions of and
as authorized by the Secured Creditors; and

(e) the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the
Reserve Accounts (including all cash therein) and other Bank Accounts to the
Purchaser at Closing or as soon as possible thereafter or, if it is determined
at or prior to Closing that such transfer is not possible at Closing or within
a reasonable period of time thereafter, shall cause the amounts in the Reserve
Accounts and other Bank Accounts to be released to the Purchaser at Closing or
as soon as possible thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Seller
is unable to transfer the Reserve Accounts and other Bank Accounts (including
all cash therein) or release the amounts therein to Purchaser by the date that
is ninety (90) days following Closing, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser,
within five (5) Business Days thereafter, an amount equal to the amounts in
the Reserve Accounts and other Bank Accounts and upon such payment Purchaser
shall have no further right to the Reserve Accounts and the other Bank
Accounts or the cash therein and as and when such funds are released,
Purchaser shall direct such funds to be paid to Seller.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchaser establishes to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Seller Parent, as confirmed by the Seller Parent in
writing, that the Purchaser will be able to perform its covenant pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(i)(A), then both Parties shall be deemed to have waived their
option to exercise the Debt Assumption Option, and the Debt Assumption Option
shall thereafter be of no further force and effect.

The Debt Assumption Option is a remedy of the Seller Parent in addition to all
other remedies available to the Seller Parent at law or under this Agreement
and the exercise or non-exercise of the Debt Assumption Option shall not
preclude Seller Parent from exercising any other remedies available at law or
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the aforementioned and anything to the
contrary, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make
the payment pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i)(A) is absolute and is not subject
to or contingent upon any condition relating to the financing of or financial
capacity of the Purchaser.

Except as set forth in Schedule 4.03 (the "Seller Consents"), for the

Except for the Purchaser Approvals, Purchaser Consents, the Competition Act
Approval and Investment Canada Act Clearance, the execution, delivery and

Assuming the Purchaser Consents, Purchaser Approvals, the Competition Act
Approval and Investment Canada Act Clearance are obtained, the execution,

operating agreement, or to the actual knowledge of Purchaser Parent, any
Contract to which Purchaser Parent is a party which would prevent, delay, or
materially burden the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the
Transaction Documents to which Purchaser Parent is a party; (b) conflict with
or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Law applicable to
Purchaser Parent which would prevent, delay or materially burden the
consummation by Purchaser Parent of the transactions contemplated herein; or

of its assets which would prevent, delay or materially burden the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein.

Except for the Purchaser Approvals, the Competition Act Approval and
Investment Canada Act Clearance, no Governmental Approval on the part of
Purchaser Parent is required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including with respect
to any Permit.

There is no Action or Proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of Purchaser
Parent, threatened, against Purchaser Parent in law or in equity or before any

prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which Purchaser Parent is a
party.

ARTICLE 12 
INDEMNIFICATION

12.01 Indemnification by Seller Indemnitors.

(e) From and after the Closing, the Seller Indemnitors, severally (each Seller
Indemnitor for its Pro Rata Share as provided in Section 12.04(c)) and not
jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all
Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting from, arising out of or related to (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty (other than any representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04) or covenant made by
Seller Parent in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the
extent such Losses are caused solely by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Purchaser or its Representatives, and (ii) any of the Excluded
Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where (A) the breach of a
representation or warranty made by Seller Parent in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto (other than any representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04) occurs as a result of
an intentional or fraudulent misrepresentation of the Seller Parent, or (B)
the breach of a covenant made by Seller Parent in this Agreement occurs as a
result of fraud, gross negligence or the willful misconduct of the Seller
Parent (each, a "Willful Breach"), the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will have
no recourse to or remedy against the Marubeni Indemnitor and the CDPQ
Indemnitor in respect of such Willful Breach, and the Invenergy Indemnitor
will be liable under this Section 12.01(a) for its Pro Rata Share and the
Marubeni Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share and the CDPQ Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share
of the Losses directly resulting from such Willful Breach, but, in each case,
only if and to the extent such Willful Breach does not result from any action
or inaction of the Marubeni Indemnitor or the CDPQ Indemnitor, as applicable,
or any of their respective Affiliates.

(f) From and after the Closing, Invenergy Indemnitor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of
them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting
from, arising out of or related to any breach of any representation or
warranty of Invenergy Indemnitor set forth in Section 3.01 or 3.02, provided,
however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the extent such
Losses are caused solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Purchaser or its Representatives.

(g) From and after the Closing, Marubeni Indemnitor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of
them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting
from, arising out of or related to any breach of any representation or
warranty of Marubeni Indemnitor set forth in Section 3.03, provided, however,
that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the extent such Losses are
caused solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser or
its Representatives.

(h) From and after the Closing, CDPQ Indemnitor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of
them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or
sustained by any of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting
from, arising out of or related to any breach of any representation or
warranty of CDPQ Indemnitor set forth in Section 3.04, provided, however, that
the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the extent such Losses are caused
solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser or its
Representatives.

(i) The amount of any indemnity payable by a Seller Indemnitor pursuant to
this Section 12.01 shall be reduced by an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share
of all insurance proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (net of all expenses of
recovery) as of the time such indemnification payment is required to be paid
in respect of the Losses arising out of the occurrence of the event giving
rise to the indemnification obligation hereunder. If the amount of any
Indemnified Party's Loss, at any time subsequent to any Indemnifying Party
making a payment under this Article 12, is reduced by recovery, settlement or
otherwise under or pursuant to any applicable insurance coverage, or pursuant
to any applicable claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any
other Person (for the purposes of this Section 12.01(e) only, collectively,
"Third Party Recoveries"), the amount of such Third Party Recoveries, net of
any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking such Third
Party Recoveries, shall be repaid by such Indemnified Party to such
Indemnifying Party within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof (or credit
therefor) by such Indemnified Party up to the amount of the payments made by
such Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party and among the Seller
Indemnitor(s) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. If any
portion of Losses to be reimbursed by any Indemnifying Party may be covered,
in whole or in part, by Third-Party Recoveries, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (for the purposes of
this Section 12.01(e) only, a "Notice of Third Party Recovery"). If any
Indemnifying Party so requests within one hundred and eighty (180) days after
receipt of a Notice of Third Party Recovery, the Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum amount of Third
Party Recoveries.

(j) From and after the Closing Date, each Seller Indemnitor shall be entitled
to discharge its obligation to indemnify and save the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties harmless pursuant to this Section 12.01 by contributing indirectly in
Seller a cash amount equal to the full amount of indemnification the
indemnified party of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties is entitled to pursuant
to this Section 12.01 and by causing Seller to pay immediately the proceeds of
such contribution to such indemnified party of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties. The Parties agree that any such payment shall constitute a refund of
the Purchase Price by Seller, including for Tax purposes. Each Seller
Indemnitor's obligation to indemnify and save the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties harmless for and from any Loss pursuant to this Section 12.01 shall be
considered to have been complied with and shall be extinguished only upon the
indemnified member of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties receiving the full
amount of indemnification it is entitled to pursuant to this Section 12.01.

12.02 Indemnification by Purchaser.

From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them
harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained
by any of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting from, arising
out of or relating to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty or
covenant made by Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not
apply to the extent such Losses are caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller Parent, Seller, Seller Indemnitors or any of their
Representatives, (ii) any of the Assumed Liabilities or any failure of
Purchaser to timely fulfill or perform the Assumed Liabilities or any of them
(excluding any Assumed Liabilities in respect of which, and to the extent
that, Purchaser is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this ARTICLE 12
(without giving effect to the Deductible)); and (iii) any Action or Proceeding
commenced by or on behalf of any Project Personnel, including an Action or Proceeding
commenced by or on behalf of any Project Personnel which relate to termination
or severance related liability, arising from or relating to any breach by
Purchaser of its obligation to offer employment to such Project Personnel in
compliance with Section 7.06(b). The amount of any such indemnity payable by
Purchaser to a Seller Parent Indemnified Party shall be reduced by the amount
of all insurance proceeds actually received by such Seller Parent Indemnified
Party (net of all expenses of recovery) as of the time such indemnification
payment is required to be paid in respect of the Losses arising out of the
occurrence of the event which gave rise to the indemnification obligation
hereunder.

12.03 Period for Making Claims.

No claim under this Agreement may be made unless the Indemnified Party shall
have delivered to the Indemnifying Party, with respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(i), 12.01(b), 12.01(c), 12.01(d)

(the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive the Closing for thirty-six
(36) months, and (d) a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
12.01(a)(ii), 12.02(ii), or 12.02(iii), as applicable, shall survive the
Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extensions thereto to the extent that such statute of
limitations may be tolled); provided, further, that if written notice for a
claim of indemnification has been provided by the Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 12.05(a) on or prior to the last day of the applicable foregoing
survival period, then the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this ARTICLE 12 shall survive with respect
to such claim until such claim is finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, all of the Parties' and the Seller
Indemnitors' post-Closing covenants shall survive until performed.

12.04 Limitations on Claims.

(c) Subject to Sections 12.04(b) and 12.04(c), the Indemnifying Party shall
not have any obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party until the aggregate
of all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the Cash
Purchase Price actually paid by Purchaser as of the relevant date (the
"Deductible), at which time the Indemnifying Party shall be required to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for all amount in excess of the Deductible.

(d) Subject to Section 12.04(c), the aggregate liability of the Seller
Indemnitors, collectively, and the aggregate liability of Purchaser under this
ARTICLE 12 shall be limited to an amount equal to fifteen (15%) of the Cash
Purchase Price actually paid by Purchaser as of the relevant date (the "Cap")
unless arising from breach of any Fundamental Representation or any covenant,
in which case the aggregate liability of the Seller Indemnitors, collectively
and the Purchaser shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the Cash Purchase
Price; provided, however, that the Deductible, and the Cap shall not apply to
any claim for indemnification pursuant to (i) Section 12.01 or Section 12.02
in respect of any claim involving fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or
willful misconduct or any breach of any representation or warranty contained
in Section 4.08 or (ii) Sections 12.01(a)(ii), 12.02(ii) or 12.02(iii).

(e) Without limiting Section 12.04(b), the liability of each Seller Indemnitor
(individually) in respect of each claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE
12 shall not exceed an amount equal to such Seller Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share
of the Recoverable Amount in respect of such claim for indemnification;
provided that (i) the aggregate liability of each Seller Indemnitor
(individually) under this ARTICLE 12 shall not exceed an amount equal to such
Seller Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share of the Cap, and (ii) the aggregate
liability of each Seller Indemnitor (individually) under this ARTICLE 12
resulting from breaches of Fundamental Representations or covenants shall not

Cash Purchase Price.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, all claims for
indemnification under this ARTICLE 12 and other recourses in respect of
breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
undertakings of Seller Parent or Seller in this Agreement and in any
certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall be made solely and exclusively
against the Seller Indemnitors in accordance with this ARTICLE 12 and the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not, in that regard, have any claim or
recourse whatsoever against Seller Parent or Seller.

12.05 Procedure for Indemnification.

(a) Notice. Whenever any claim shall arise for indemnification under this
ARTICLE 12, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
of the claim and, when known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim.
In the event of any such claim for indemnification hereunder resulting from or
in connection with any claim or legal proceedings by a third party, the notice
shall specify, if known, the amount or an estimate of the amount of the
liability arising therefrom.

(b) Settlement of Losses. The Indemnified Party shall not settle, consent to
the entry of a judgment of or compromise any claim by a third party for which
it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
Indemnifying Party.

(c) Control and Management of Claims. The Seller Indemnitors hereby
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any agreement between any of the
Seller Indemnitors or their respective Affiliates, the Invenergy Indemnitor
will control and manage any and all claims for indemnification arising under
Section 12.01(a), including the control and management of any claim or legal
proceeding in respect of which the Seller Indemnitors, as Indemnifying
Parties, may assume the defense and control pursuant to Section 12.06. Any
action taken by the Invenergy Indemnitor shall be binding on all Seller
Indemnitors; provided that the Invenergy Indemnitor shall not settle, consent
to the entry of a judgment of or compromise any such claim without the prior
written consent of the other Seller Indemnitors (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each of the Seller Indemnitors agrees to reimburse the Invenergy
Indemnitor for the out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including legal
expenses) incurred in connection with the control and management of any such
claim. The Invenergy Indemnitor shall keep the Seller Indemnitors informed of
the development and process of any such claim and shall consult with the
Seller Indemnitors on any significant decision to be made in connection with
any such claim. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the Seller Indemnitors
agree that if any defense to a claim for indemnification is available to a
Seller Indemnitor and is not available to all Seller Indemnitors, such Seller
Indemnitor shall be entitled to pursue that part of the defense by retaining
its own legal counsel at its own costs and will coordinate its efforts with
those of the Invenergy Indemnitor except to the extent that the defense
presents a conflict of legal interests amongst the Seller Indemnitors in which
case the applicable Seller Indemnitor shall have sole control of its defense
at its own costs. For greater certainty, each Seller Indemnitor will be
responsible for the control and management of any and all claims for
indemnification made against such Seller Indemnitor pursuant to Section
12.01(b), 12.01(c) or 12.01(d), as applicable. Whenever a Seller Indemnitor
receives any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 12.01(b), 12.01(c)
or 12.01(d), as applicable, such Seller Indemnitor shall promptly notify the
other Seller Indemnitors of the claim and, when known, the facts constituting
the basis for such claim. Purchaser may rely and shall be protected in acting
or refraining from acting upon any written notice (including, but not limited
to, electronically confirmed facsimiles of such notice) believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the Invenergy Indemnitor (or a
Person believed by it to be the Invenergy Indemnitor) and Purchaser shall have
not have any obligation to review or confirm that actions taken pursuant to
such notice in accordance with this Agreement comply with any other agreement
or document.

12.06 Rights of Indemnifying Party.

(a) Right to Assume the Defense. In connection with any claim which may give
rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any claim or
legal proceeding by a Person other than the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party, may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume
and control the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, which defense
shall be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or
settlement in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, however, the
Indemnifying Party may not assume and control such defense if it would be a
material conflict of interest or materially adverse to the interests of the
Indemnified Party.

(b) Procedure. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such claim
or legal proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such
claims or legal proceedings, and (ii) take all steps necessary in the defense
or settlement thereof, at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, the Indemnified
Party shall provide any information or authorization as may be reasonably
necessary to allow the Indemnifying Party to defend such claim or legal
proceeding. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such action, with its own counsel and at its sole
cost and expense, or take any other actions it reasonably believes to be
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests. (c) Settlement of Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) Decline to Assume the Defense. If (a) the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom within
thirty (30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of such
claim by the Indemnified Party, (b) the claim for indemnification relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (c) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party, or (d) the Indemnifying Party is failing
to prosecute or defend such claim in good faith, then: (i) the Indemnified
Party may defend against such claim or litigation, at the sole cost and
expense (which cost and expense shall be reasonable) of the Indemnifying
Party, in such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, including
settling such claim or litigation, subject to the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
(but not control) the defense of such action, with its counsel and at its sole
cost and expense.

12.07 Exclusive Remedy.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which may be contained herein, (i)
the indemnities set forth in this ARTICLE 12 shall become effective as of the
Closing and (ii) except as set forth in Section 7.04, ARTICLE 10 or Section
15.04, if the Closing shall occur the indemnities set forth in this ARTICLE 12
shall be the exclusive remedies of the Seller Parent Indemnified Parties and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties due to breach or misrepresentation of, or
inaccuracy in, a representation or warranty, nonfulfillment or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and the Parties
shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further
indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof,
all of which the Parties hereto hereby waive.

12.08 Treatment of Payment.

All amounts payable by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 12.02 will be
deemed to be an increase to the Purchase Price for Tax and all other
applicable purposes.

(20) day period. If an Indemnifying Party so disputes any such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall make payment of any amount of such claim which is not
disputed by not later than the Indemnity Payment Date, and shall withhold
payment of the disputed amount of such claim until final determination of
liability with respect to such claim in accordance with this Agreement,
whereupon the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount so determined to be
owed. 

ARTICLE 13 
TERMINATION

13.01 Termination.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and the Seller Parent;

(b) by either Seller Parent or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or
before December 15, 2015 (the "Termination Date") and the failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not caused by a
breach of this Agreement by the terminating party;

(c) by Purchaser if there has been a breach by Seller Parent of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in ARTICLE 8, and
(ii) either (x) cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date, or (y) is a
breach of Seller Parent's obligations to cause the Seller to transfer the
Acquired Assets at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement; and

(d) by Seller Parent if there has been a breach by Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in ARTICLE 9, and
(ii) either (x) cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date, or (y) is a
breach of Purchaser's obligations to pay the Purchase Price at the Closing in

Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and there will be no liability
or obligation on the part of either Seller Parent or Purchaser (or any of
their respective Representatives or Affiliates) in respect of this Agreement,
except that the applicable portions of Article 1, this Section 13.02, and the
entirety of 15.06, 15.07 and 15.14 will continue to apply following any
termination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 13.02 shall
release any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement by such
Party prior to the termination of this Agreement (and any attempted
termination by the breaching Party shall be void).

(c) Upon termination of this Agreement by a Party for any reason, Purchaser
shall, at Seller Parent's request, return or destroy all documents and other
materials of Seller Parent relating to Seller, the Acquired Assets, the

the Commissioner of Competition, including an application for an Advance
Ruling Certificate. In addition, if requested by Seller Parent or Purchaser,
Seller Parent and Purchaser will promptly file a notice under section 114 of
the Competition Act. Purchaser and Seller Parent shall cooperate with one
another in connection with obtaining the Competition Act Approval. Subject to
Laws, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall keep each other fully informed as to
the status of and the processes and proceedings relating to obtaining the
Competition Act Approval, and shall promptly notify each other of any material

the Commissioner of Competition without the prior written approval of Seller
Parent or Purchaser (as applicable), such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Despite the foregoing, submissions, filings,

Competition may be redacted as necessary before sharing with the other Party
to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns, provided that a Party shall provide external legal counsel to the
other Party non-redacted versions of drafts or final submissions, filings or
other written communications with the Commissioner of Competition on the basis

15.03 Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement (subject to Section 15.07), the
Bill of Sale, the Lease Assignment, Purchaser Parent Guaranty, the Transition
Services Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto, and the
other documents executed and delivered on the Closing Date, shall supersede
all previous oral and written and all contemporaneous oral negotiations,
commitments, and understandings and all other letters, memoranda or other
documents or communications, whether oral, written or electronic, in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and with
respect to the subject hereof.

15.04 Specific Performance.

The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of ARTICLE 6 or ARTICLE 7,
Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.05, or Section 15.07 of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
irreparable damage would occur and money damages may not be a sufficient
remedy. In addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, each of Purchaser and Seller Parent shall be entitled to specific performance by the other Party
of its obligations under this Agreement and immediate injunctive relief,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.

15.05 Time of the Essence.

Time is of the essence with regard to all duties and time periods set forth in
this Agreement.

15.06 Expenses.

(a) Subject to Section 15.06(b), each Party shall pay for, assume and be
responsible for the costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
drafting, negotiation and execution of the Transaction Documents and the
performance of its obligations thereunder and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the fees and expenses of its
legal counsel, accountants and other advisors incurred in connection
therewith.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary:

(i) Purchaser shall solely pay for, assume and be responsible for the payment
of all fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) of the
Secured Creditors and the Seller incurred in connection with the negotiation
of the Payout Letter, the reimbursement of the Credit Facility Obligations and
the release of the Secured Creditors' Liens (and matters incidental thereto);

(ii) Purchaser shall pay 50% and Seller shall pay 50% of any requisite filing
fees in relation to any filing or application made in respect of the
Competition Act;

(iii) Purchaser agrees to pay for, assume and be responsible for the first one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of all fees, costs and expenses (excluding
fees, costs and expenses covered by clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 15.06(b))
incurred or payable by Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of or in
connection with the obtaining of the Seller Approvals and the Seller Consents,
including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection thereto by
Seller's counterparties to any Material Seller Contracts (but excluding any
fees incurred or paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates, without Purchaser's
prior written approval, to any Person as consideration for obtaining any
Seller Approval or Seller Consent where Seller does not have any contractual
or other legally binding obligation to pay such fees). The Purchaser and
Seller Indemnitors agree that all such fees, costs and expenses which are in
excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) shall be paid 50% by the
Seller Indemnitors in accordance with their Pro Rata Share and 50% by
Purchaser.

15.07 Confidentiality.

Unless and until the Closing occurs, all information disclosed to a Party by
another Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Parties will abide by the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. From and after the Closing Date the Confidentiality
Agreement no longer applies with respect to information relating to the
applicable Project and Acquired Assets. With respect to the Project, from and after the
Closing Date, the Seller Parent will hold, and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any other Person all
information and documents relating to the Acquired Assets and the Project,
provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the disclosure by any Party
of any information (a) to the extent required by Law or judicial process
(provided that if permitted by Law, each Party agrees to give the other Party
prior notice of such disclosure in sufficient time to permit such other Party
to obtain a protective order should they so determine), (b) in connection with
any litigation between the Parties (provided that such Party has taken all
reasonable actions to limit the scope and degree of disclosure in any such
litigation), (c) in an Action or Proceeding brought by a Party in pursuit of
its rights or in the exercise of its remedies under the Investment Documents,
(d) to the extent that such documents or information can be shown to have come
within the public domain through no action or omission of the disclosing Party
or its Affiliates or Representatives, and (e) to its Affiliates (but the Party
shall be liable for any breach by its Affiliates). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all information disclosed
to any Seller Indemnitor and any of its Affiliates shall be permitted and
shall not constitute a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or of this
Section 15.07 to the extent that such recipients hold such information in
strict confidence.

15.08 Waiver.

Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party
that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective
unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the
Party waiving such term or condition and delivered pursuant to Section 15.02.
No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one
or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same
or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

15.09 Amendment.

This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only by a written
instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each Party, provided that any
amendment, supplement or modification to the definition of Pro Rata Share or
to ARTICLE 12 shall also require the signatures of the Seller Indemnitors.
Notwithstanding the forgoing nor anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Section 15.09 and Sections 15.10, 15.13, 15.14, 15.15 and 15.22, in each
case solely as such Section relates to the Financing Sources (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of this Section
15.09 or Sections 15.10, 15.13, 15.14, 15.15 or 15.22, in each case solely as
such Section relates to the Financing Sources) may not be amended, modified,
waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Lead Arrangers.

15.10 No Third Party Beneficiary.

The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit
of each Party and their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is
not the intention of the Parties to confer third party beneficiary rights upon
any other Person other than any Person entitled to indemnity under ARTICLE 10 or ARTICLE 12, except that the Financing Sources shall be
third party beneficiaries of Section 15.09, this Section 15.10, and Sections
15.13, 15.14, 15.15 and 15.22 hereof, in each case solely as such Sections
relate to the Financing Sources.

15.11 Assignment.

The rights and obligations of the Parties and the Seller Indemnitors under
this Agreement are not assignable without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which such Party may withhold in its discretion; provided
however, that (a) any such assignment by any Party to an Affiliate of
Purchaser or Seller Parent, as applicable, following the Closing shall not
require consent so long as the guaranties provided by the assignor party
remain in full force and effect and are applicable to such Affiliate assignee,
and any such Affiliate assignee agrees to be bound by this Agreement and such
assignment shall not relieve the assignor party from its obligations
hereunder, and (b) any assignment following the Closing of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Documents as a result of any winding-up or liquidation
of Seller, General Partner, Seller Parent or their direct or indirect
shareholders or partners (excluding any Seller Indemnitor) shall not require
consent of Purchaser so long as the applicable assignee agrees to assume all
obligations and liabilities of the entity being wound-up or liquidated
pursuant to this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents to which the
entity being wound-up or liquidated is a party. The Purchaser agrees, upon
request by Seller Parent, to release and discharge the entity being wound-up
or liquidated (excluding, for greater certainty, any Seller Indemnitor) of all
of its obligations and liabilities pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which such entity is a party, provided that (i) the
applicable assignee assumes all obligations and liabilities of the entity
being wound-up or liquidated pursuant to this Agreement and any other
Transaction Documents to which the entity being wound-up or liquidated is a
party and (ii) such release and discharge does not and shall not affect the
obligations of the Seller Indemnitors pursuant to this Agreement.

15.12 Severability.

Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, without affecting in any
way the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or
any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
any other jurisdiction. Should any provision of this Agreement be or become
invalid or unenforceable as a whole or in part, this Agreement shall be
reformed to come closest to the original intent and purpose of the Parties.

the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees
related thereto (as the prevailing Party and the amount of recoverable
attorneys' fees are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final
non-appealable order).

15.17 Limitation on Certain Damages. NO CLAIMS SHALL BE MADE BY ANY PARTY HERETO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS OR AGENTS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS OR AGENTS FOR ANY

ANY ACT OR OMISSION OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH; AND EACH PARTY

INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ENTITLED TO BE INDEMNIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 12.

15.18 Disclosures.

Seller Parent or Purchaser may, at its option, include in the Disclosure
Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding,
and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be
deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items are material,
to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of
such terms for purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the inclusion of
any matter in the Disclosure Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden
Seller Parent's or Purchaser's representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission by Seller Parent or
Purchaser that such item represents a material exception or fact, event, or
circumstance.

each of the other schedules of the Disclosure Schedules only if there is an
