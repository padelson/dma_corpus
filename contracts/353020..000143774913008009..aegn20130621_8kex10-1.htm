Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer to, prepare and deliver to the Key
Seller a balance sheet of the Limited Partnership as of immediately prior to
the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), a proposed Final Working Capital
Schedule and Buyer's proposed calculation of the Final Working Capital Value,
the Closing Date Cash and the Other Closing Deductions (collectively, "Buyer
Post-Closing Deliveries"). Key Seller shall have a period of sixty (60) days
after Buyer's delivery of the Buyer Post-Closing Deliveries during which to
notify Buyer of any dispute of any item contained in the Buyer Post-Closing
Deliveries, which notice will set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such dispute. If Key Seller does not notify Buyer of any such dispute within
such sixty (60) day period, then the proposed Final Working Capital Schedule
delivered by Buyer will be deemed to be the Final Working Capital Schedule and
the other proposed calculations delivered in the Buyer Post-Closing Deliveries
shall be deemed to be final. Buyer and Key Seller will cooperate in good faith
to attempt to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such
resolution, Buyer and Key Seller will prepare a working capital schedule in
accordance with such resolution, which shall be deemed the Final Working
Capital Schedule, and calculations of the final amount of the Other Closing
Deductions and the Closing Date Cash.

 



 

(c) If Buyer and Key Seller are unable to resolve any dispute
regarding the Buyer Post-Closing Deliveries within thirty (30) days after
Buyer's receipt of notice from Key Seller that Key Seller disputes any aspect
of such items, or such longer period as Buyer and Key Seller may mutually
agree upon in writing, such dispute and each Party's work papers related
thereto will be submitted to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute
will be resolved by, (x) KPMG, or (y) if such accounting firm is unable or
unwilling to take such assignment, a reputable independent accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Key Seller (such identified accounting firm
or agreed upon accounting firm, as the case may be, the "Selected Firm"). Such
resolution will be final and binding on the Parties. The Parties will direct
the Selected Firm to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its work
within thirty (30) days after its engagement. In resolving any matters in
dispute, the Selected Firm may not assign a value to any item in dispute
greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one
hand, or the Key Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value
for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Key Seller, on the
other hand. The Selected Firm's determination of the Final Working Capital
Schedule, the final Closing Date Cash and the final Other Closing Deductions
will be based solely on presentations by Key Seller and Buyer, which are in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (
_i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The Selected Firm's
determination of the Final Working Capital Schedule, the final Closing Date
Cash and the final Other Closing Deductions will become final and binding on
the Parties on the date the Selected Firm delivers its final resolution in
writing to the Parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Selected Firm (i)
will be borne by Sellers in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
all such disputed items so submitted that are resolved against Key Seller (as
finally determined by the Selected Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount
of such items so submitted and (ii) will be borne by Buyer in the proportion
that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so submitted that are
resolved against Buyer bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all such items
so submitted.

any of its advisors reasonable access to the books and records of the Target

relevant personnel and representatives, to allow Key Seller to handle its
review of, and any disputes relating to, the Buyer Post-Closing Deliveries
under this _Section 2.5_.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) If the Final Working Capital Value exceeds the Preliminary
Working Capital Value (such difference being referred to herein as the "Unpaid
Balance"), then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the
Final Working Capital Value, Buyer will, and Parent will cause Buyer to, pay
Sellers collectively (with each Seller entitled to receive its Pro Rata
Percentage of such amount) an amount equal to the Unpaid Balance. If the final
amount of the Closing Date Cash as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_
exceeds the estimated amount added to the Purchase Price at Closing then,
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the final amount of
the Closing Date Cash, Buyer will, and Parent will cause Buyer to pay Sellers
collectively (with each Seller entitled to receive its Pro Rata Percentage of
such amount) an amount equal to such excess. If the final amount of the Other
Closing Deductions as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ is less than

items then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the final
amount of the Other Closing Deductions, Buyer will, and Parent will cause
Buyer to, pay Sellers collectively (with each Seller entitled to receive its
Pro Rata Percentage of such amount) an amount equal to such difference.

the Final Working Capital Value, Sellers will pay Buyer an amount equal to the
Overpayment (with each Seller to pay its Pro Rata Percentage of such amount).
If the final amount of the Closing Date Cash as determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_ is less than the estimated amount added to the Purchase Price at
Closing, then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the
final amount of the Closing Date Cash, Sellers will pay Buyer an amount equal
to the difference (with each Seller to pay its Pro Rata Percentage of such
amount). If the final amount of the other Closing Deductions as determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ is greater than the estimated amount deducted
from the Purchase Price at Closing for such items, then, within five (5)
Business Days after the determination of the final amount of the Other Closing
Deductions, Sellers will pay Buyer an amount equal to the difference (with
each Seller to pay its Pro Rata Percentage of such amount). Buyer may, upon
Buyer's election in its sole discretion, require payment of amounts pursuant
to this _Section 2.5(f)_ by release of funds to Buyer from the Escrow Account
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(g) All amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ will constitute
an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Parties intend
for the purchase of the Equity Interests contemplated by this Agreement to be
treated as a transaction governed by Rev. Rul. 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432
(Situation 2), with the Sellers being treated as having sold their Partnership
Interests in the Limited Partnership directly to a Buyer Party (or a member of
the Parent group) with the result that (i) the Limited Partnership is deemed
to make a liquidating distribution of its assets and liabilities to the
Sellers and the General Partner, and (ii) the Buyer Party (or a member of the
Parent group) is deemed to acquire, by purchase, all of the assets (and assume
all of liabilities) of the Limited Partnership (the "Purchased Assets") from
the Sellers and the General Partner. The Parties agree to allocate the
Purchase Price (and any capitalized costs and assumed liabilities) among the
Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with Code Section 1060 and the
regulations thereunder following the final determination of the Closing
Balance Sheet pursuant to _Section 2.5_ in accordance with the following
procedures. Promptly following, but no later than sixty (60) days following,
the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to _Section 2.5_
, Parent shall deliver to Key Seller a draft IRS Form 8594 and any required
exhibits thereto setting forth in reasonable detail its proposed determination
of the allocation of the Purchase Price (and any capitalized costs and assumed
liabilities) among the Purchased Assets, which determination shall be
reasonable and prepared in good faith (the "Section 1060 Allocation"). To the
extent that Key Seller in good faith disagrees with the content of the Section
1060 Allocation, Key Seller shall notify Parent within thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Section 1060 Allocation and provide a written
description of those items to which it disagrees. Parent and Key Seller shall
act in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding the Section 1060
Allocation and finalize it no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
following the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to
_Section 2.5_ , but in any event prior to the required filing deadline for IRS
Form 8594. If Parent and Key Seller are not able to resolve their
disagreement, they shall submit the disagreement to the Selected Firm set
forth in _Section 2.5_ for resolution. Upon finalizing the Section 1060
Allocation, the Parties shall execute and timely file IRS Form 8594 (and any
equivalent state, municipal, county, or foreign Tax form). The Section 1060
Allocation shall be binding on Sellers, Buyer, Parent and the Limited
Partnership, and neither Sellers, nor Buyer, nor Parent nor the Limited
Partnership shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Section 1060 Allocation unless
required to do so by applicable Law.

(3) years written notice from any third party that the operation of the
businesses of the Target Companies as currently conducted infringes or

the Knowledge of Sellers, no Person is infringing or misappropriating any
Intellectual Property of the Target Companies in any material way.

Knowledge of Sellers, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any such
Permits or Licenses shall not be renewed upon expiration. There are no Permits
or Licenses that are necessary for the lawful operation in all material
respects of the business of any Target Company as presently conducted or the
ownership or utilization or operation of the presently-owned assets of the
Target Companies. The Target Companies have fulfilled and performed all of
their respective material obligations with respect to Permits and Licenses

Governmental Entity regarding any actual, alleged, or potential violation of,

effective favorable determination notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status (or the qualified status of
the master or prototype form on which it is established) from the Internal
Revenue Service (or still has a remaining period of time in which to apply for
or receive such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination) and to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no fact or
circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan; (iii) there are no audits,
inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, or other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan; (iv) except as

Company Benefit Plan, and to the Knowledge of Sellers, there exist no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Order
or Action; and (v) all Company Benefit Plans that are group health plans have

(g) Except as required by applicable Law or as set forth on
_Schedule 3.13(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions

additional benefits or result in the acceleration or creation of any rights of

Section 6.1 __ __

 |  

 _Tax Matters_ _._ 

---|---|--- 

 



 

(a) Sellers shall cause to be timely paid, before the same shall
become delinquent and before penalties accrue thereon, all Taxes (i) shown (or
required to be shown) to be due on any Tax Return (or amendment thereto) filed
(or required to be filed) by Sellers or any Target Company with respect to all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent such Tax Returns are required to be
filed on, before or after the Closing Date and (ii) that become due from, or
payable by, Seller or any Target Company with respect to such periods.

 



 

(b) Key Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Target Companies that are to be
filed in respect of all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than any Straddle
Period). Any such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past custom and practice. Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer to,
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Target Companies that are filed after the Closing Date and relate to a
Straddle Period. If any Seller may be liable for any Taxes due with respect to
the Tax Returns prepared by Buyer, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer
to, permit Key Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to
filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by Key Seller. Buyer and Key Seller shall attempt to resolve in good
faith any disagreement arising out of any Tax Returns governed by this
_Section 6.1(b)_ or any calculation of Sellers' share of the related Tax
liability. If any such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days prior
to the deadline for filing the Tax Return in question, the matter shall be
submitted for binding resolution to the Selected Firm. The Selected Firm will
have ten (10) days within which to resolve the disagreement. The fees and
expenses of the Selected Firm shall be borne 50% by Sellers and 50% by Buyer.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) After the Closing Date, Buyer Parties will not, nor will it
permit any Target Company or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing to, (i)
amend, modify or otherwise change any Tax Return of a Target Company relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) initiate the filing of Tax Returns not
previously filed by a Target Company that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
without Key Seller's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, if such amendment, modification, change or new filing could have the
effect of increasing Sellers' Tax liability for any period or Sellers'
indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Key Seller, the Companies and Buyer Parties shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include, without limitation, the execution and signing of any Tax
Returns and related documents and the retention and (upon the other Party's
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis (without cost) to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Companies and Buyer Parties agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to a Target Company relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority; (ii)
to deliver or make available to Key Seller, within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, copies of all such books and records; and (iii) to give the
other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests,
Buyer Parties, the Target Companies and Key Seller, as the case may be, shall
allow the other Party to take possession or to prepare copies of such books
and records at such other Party's expense.

 



 

(e) This _Section 6.1(e)_, and not _Section 8.5(a)_ and _Section
8.5(b)_ , will govern with respect to Tax Claims. Promptly after receipt by
Sellers, Buyer Parties or a Target Company of written notice of the assertion
or commencement of any such claim, audit, examination or other proposed change
or adjustment by any taxing authority relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a
"Tax Claim"), each such Party will immediately provide notice of such Tax
Claim to each other. Such notice will contain factual information (to the
extent known) describing the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and will
include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing
authority in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. Key Seller will have the
sole right, at its expense, to represent the Target Companies' interests in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that could affect Sellers' indemnification obligations
under this Agreement (or Sellers' liability for Taxes under this Agreement) or
otherwise, and to employ counsel of Key Seller's choice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer and its representatives will be permitted to be present
at any Tax proceeding related to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, at its expense.
Key Seller will not settle or compromise any such proceeding without Buyer's
prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If Key
Seller chooses not to control the defense of any such Tax Claim, Buyer shall
control the defense of such Tax Claim, at Key Seller's expense. Key Seller
will have the right, at its expense, to be present at any Tax proceeding for
Straddle Periods, and to approve (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) the disposition thereof if such disposition would increase
Sellers' indemnification obligations under this Agreement (or Sellers'
liability for Taxes under this Agreement) or to any taxing authority.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) Any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or arrangement, whether
or not written, that may have been entered into between Sellers and the Target
Companies or with any Person shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and
after the Closing Date, neither Buyer or its Affiliates shall be bound thereby
or have any liability thereunder; provided, however, that this provision shall
not apply in respect of any Target Company that is properly treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes, to the extent tax distributions
are to be made by any Target Company under the existing terms of any
applicable operating or partnership agreement.

 



 

(g) Key Seller and Buyer Parties further agree, upon request from
the other Party, to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax referred
to in _Section 6.1(h)_ that could be imposed (including, but not limited to,
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(h) With respect to the Equity Interests of the General Partner,
Sellers hereby agree that, if requested by Buyer, Sellers will jointly make a
tax election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) under the Code, as amended, and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder pursuant to federal and applicable state
Tax purposes (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). For state income and federal
Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by law or regulation, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that all Tax Returns shall be filed on the basis that
the applicable state equivalent of the Section 338(h)(10) Election terminated
the tax year of the General Partner as of the Closing Date. Key Seller and
Buyer shall within 60 days after the completion of the statements, but in no
event later than ten days prior to the due date for filing Internal Revenue
Service Form 8023, exchange completed copies of such form, required schedules
thereto and any similar state or local forms. If any changes are required in
these forms as a result of information which is first available after these
forms are prepared, the parties will promptly agree on such changes.

 



 

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement will be paid one half by Sellers and one half
by Buyer. Buyer and Sellers will jointly file or caused to be filed all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees.

 



 

(j) Any income Tax refunds that are received by Buyer Parties or a
Target Company, including any such income Tax refunds credited against income
Tax, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Sellers, and Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer to, pay over to Sellers
(with each Seller entitled to receive its Pro Rata Percentage of such amount)
any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days
after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(k) To the extent applicable in respect of any Target Company's
employees, Buyer agrees and Seller agrees, or shall cause such Target Company,
to use the alternate procedure set forth in Internal Revenue Service Procedure
2004-53 with respect to wage reporting.

 



 

(l) On or prior to the date on which such election must be filed,
Sellers shall cause the Limited Partnership to make a timely election pursuant
to Code Section 754 and any similar provision of state law with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. From the Effective
Date until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement, Sellers shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Companies to),
directly or indirectly, through any representative or otherwise, initiate,
solicit or entertain (including by way of furnishing non-public information or
assistance), or enter into negotiations of any type, directly or indirectly,
or enter into a confidentiality agreement, letter of intent or purchase
agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement with any Person other
than Buyer Parties with respect to a sale of all or any portion of the
Companies (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business),
or a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of all or any
substantial portion of the equity of the Companies, or the liquidation or
similar extraordinary transaction with respect to the Companies. Key Seller
will cause the Companies to notify Buyer or Parent in writing (within three
(3) Business Days) of any inquiry or proposal by a third-party to do any of
the foregoing, which the Companies or any Seller or any of their Affiliates or
their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other
representatives may receive relating to any of such matters.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Conduct of Business_. For the period commencing on
the Effective Date and ending on the Closing Date, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or consented to in writing by Buyer (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Sellers will

Companies), and Key Seller and Energy Constructors will cause each of the

Section 6.4 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) All non-public information, including, but not limited to, the
Purchase Price, disclosed by any Party (or its representatives) whether before
or after the Effective Date, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by, or the discussions and negotiations preceding, this Agreement to any other

and its representatives and will not be used by any such Persons other than as
contemplated by this Agreement, except (i) in connection with any action, suit
or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision

(b) From and after the Closing, each Seller and Gary Brinderson

Section 6.5 _Consents; Cooperation_ _._

 



 

(a) The Parties will cooperate, and each will use its commercially
reasonable efforts, to make all filings and obtain all consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and seek estoppel
certificates from third parties as requested by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions of Sellers and Buyer with
respect to filings, approvals and other matters pursuant to HSR and any local,
state, federal (other than HSR) or foreign antitrust statute, antitrust law,
antitrust regulation or antitrust rule applicable to a Company, Sellers or
Buyer ("Other Antitrust Regulations") will be governed by subsections (b), (c)
and (d) of this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(b) Buyer and Sellers have filed with the United States Federal

making such filings and submissions and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to make such filings and submissions at the agreed upon time.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Key Seller will keep each other apprised in a prompt

efforts will include defending through litigation a motion for preliminary
injunction asserted in any court by the FTC, the DOJ and/or any third-party.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) No Party shall be required to supply the other (or its counsel)
with any information, documents or materials to the extent that any Law
requires such Party to restrict or prohibit access to such property or
information, documents or materials to the extent such information, documents
or materials contain any proprietary or confidential business information of
the Party. No Party shall be required to take any action with respect to
satisfying any Laws which would bind such Party irrespective of whether the
Closing occurs and nothing in this Section shall be construed to require a
Party to agree to any disposition or restriction with respect to any assets or
operations of such Party or any of its Affiliates, or to cause any of its
Affiliates to do or agree to do any of the foregoing. No Party shall submit a
request for early expiration or termination of the waiting or notice periods

the other Parties.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, each Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
take, or cause to be taken, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,

respective obligations under this Agreement and to cause the consummation of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Covenant Not to Compete_ _._

 



 

(a) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each
Seller set forth on _Schedule 6.7(a)_ , Key Seller and Gary Brinderson will,
for a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, refrain from
acquiring, owning, holding or operating, or otherwise having any direct or
indirect financial interest in, a business or enterprise (a "Seller Restricted
Business"), directly or indirectly, that is competitive with the Business in
the Territory. The Sellers bound by this _Section 6.7_ and Gary Brinderson
shall be referred to in this _Section 6.7_ collectively as the "Non-compete
Parties". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the Non-
compete Parties may (i) own up to five (5) percent of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of a publicly held entity carrying on a Seller
Restricted Business, so long as such Non-compete Party does not participate in
the control of the Seller Restricted Business, and (ii) passively invest in a
venture capital, private equity or other fund with a portfolio that includes
equity of a Seller Restricted Business.

 



 

(b) As a further inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement,
the Non-compete Parties will, for a period of three (3) years from and after
the Closing Date, refrain, directly or indirectly, from soliciting the
employment or engagement of a natural Person who was employed or engaged by
the Limited Partnership or Constructors as of the open of business on the
Closing Date (each, a "Restricted Person" and collectively, the "Restricted
Persons"); _provided_ , that nothing herein will prohibit each of the Non-
compete Parties from (i) making general solicitation advertisements that are
not targeted at the Restricted Persons, (ii) soliciting the employment or
engagement of any Restricted Person who is not at the time of such
solicitation, and who has not within the 12 months prior to such time been,
employed by the Limited Partnership or Constructors, or (iii) soliciting the
employment or engagement of any Restricted Person whose employment or
engagement was involuntarily terminated by the Limited Partnership or
Constructors prior to such solicitation.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) As a further inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement,
Gary Brinderson agrees that neither he, nor his Affiliates will, directly or
indirectly, at any time from and after the Closing Date, use the name
"Brinderson" or any derivatives thereof (either alone or in combination with
any other name or mark) with respect to or in connection with the Business.

 



 

(d) The Non-compete Parties acknowledge that Buyer has required that
the Non-compete Parties make the agreements in this _Section 6.7_ as a
condition to Buyer's consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Non-compete Parties understand and acknowledge that Buyer
intends for the Target Companies, after the Closing, to conduct the Business
in the Territory and that the agreements in this _Section 6.7_ are a material
inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement. The Non-compete Parties
have obtained specialized knowledge as a result of their ownership of equity
interests in the Target Companies and acknowledge that the agreements stated
in this _Section 6.7_ are reasonable (including with respect to duration,
geographical area and scope) and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of Buyer and that any violation or breach of this _Section 6.7_ will result in
substantial and irreparable harm to Buyer for which no adequate remedy would
exist at law. Accordingly, regardless of any other provision contained in this
Agreement, Buyer will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief
restraining such violation or breach without the necessity of proving actual
damage or posting a bond.

 



 

(e) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds
that any term or provision of this _Section 6.7_ is invalid or unenforceable,
the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have
the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed; _provided_ ,
that such modification will apply only to the extent that it affects the
jurisdiction under the laws of which the original term or condition have been
held to be invalid or unenforceable, and the original term or condition will
otherwise continue in full force and effect.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Buyer Parties and Key Seller
will consult with each other and will mutually agree (the agreement of each
Party not to be unreasonably withheld) upon the content and timing of any
press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation and agreement,
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any securities exchange or any stock exchange
regulations; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and Key Seller will give
prior notice to the other Party of the content and timing of any such press
release or other public statement required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange or any stock
exchange regulations. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be
authorized to act on behalf of the Key Seller with respect to this Section
6.8.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Access and Investigation_. Except (a) as otherwise
prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any Contract, (b) as would be
reasonably expected to violate the attorney-client privilege of Sellers or a
Target Company, or (c) with respect to any competitive information (including
any customer data), from the Effective Date until the Closing Date or
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall have access to the business,
properties and books and records of the Target Companies and information
concerning their financial and legal condition as Buyer reasonably deems
necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that (i) Buyer shall, and Parent
shall cause Buyer to, provide reasonable notice to Key Seller, (ii) such
access shall not interfere with normal operations of the Target Companies and
(iii) access to the Leased Real Property shall be only permitted at reasonable
times during normal business hours (or at such other times as Key Seller may
approve in its reasonable discretion). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any confidentiality or non-disclosure provision contained in any
Contract is breached or violated as a result of Sellers' compliance with this
_Section 6.9_ , such breach or violation shall not constitute a breach or
violation of any provision in this Agreement and will not form the basis for
any indemnification claim under _Section 8.2_.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.10 _Supplements to Schedule_. From time to time up to the
Closing Date, Sellers may supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Letter
that they have delivered pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any matter
first existing or that occurs following the Effective Date which, if existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Date, would have been required to be
set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Letter or that is necessary to
correct any information in such schedules that has been rendered inaccurate
thereby. No such supplement or amendment to the Seller Disclosure Letter will
have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
stated in _Section 7.2_ , but any matter arising after the Effective Date and
disclosed in a supplemental or amended Seller Disclosure Letter pursuant to
this _Section 6.10_ will not form the basis for any indemnification claim if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

 



 

Section 6.11 _WARN Act_. At and after the Closing, Buyer Parties
will not, and will not cause or permit a Target Company or its Affiliates to,
take or refrain from taking any action that would cause Sellers to have any
liability or obligations under the WARN Act or any applicable similar state or
local Law.

 



 

Section 6.12 _No Implied Representations or Warranties_ _._

 



 

(a) Buyer Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that no Seller is
making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied,
except those representations and warranties of Sellers that are set forth in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_. The disclosure of any matter or item in the
Seller Disclosure Letter will not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment
that any such matter is required to be disclosed.

by the Target Companies (the "DandO Tail"). Sellers shall provide Buyer the
opportunity to review and reasonably approve the terms of such DandO Tail. Buyer
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the DandO
Tail and neither Buyer Parties nor any Target Company shall amend or cancel
the DandO Tail after Closing; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor any
Target Company shall be required after Closing to pay any additional premiums
or other amounts with respect to the DandO Tail.

(a) the representations and warranties stated in _Section 3.15_ (Tax
Returns; Taxes) will survive until the date that is ninety (90) days after the
expiration of the state and federal statutes of limitations applicable to the
matters covered thereby; and

 



 

(b) the representations and warranties stated in _Section 3.1_
(Organization and Good Standing); clauses (a), (b) and (c) of _Section 3.2_

and warranties identified in this _Section 8.1(b)_.

 



 

 



   



 

The term "Survival Period," when used in this _Article VIII_ with respect to
the representations and warranties stated in this Agreement refers to the
period from and after the Closing until the applicable date upon which such
representations and warranties will expire in accordance with this _Section

this Agreement that are, by their terms, to be fulfilled or performed after
the Closing, shall survive the Closing until fully performed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if written notice of a Claim is given in good faith under and
in accordance with this _Article VIII_ with respect to any representation or
warranty prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, then such
representation or warranty will continue indefinitely only with respect to
such Claim until such Claim is finally resolved. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Parties agree that no Claims or causes of action may be brought
based upon any of the representations and warranties stated in this Agreement
after expiration of the applicable Survival Period.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Buyer Indemnification_ _._

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Sellers will in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentage indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Buyer Parties and their respective officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Target
Companies) (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against all
Damages actually asserted against or actually incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee
as a result of or arising out of:

 



 

(i) (A) any Taxes of a Target Company with respect to Pre-Closing

Company attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election
(including (i) any Tax imposed under section 1374 of the Code, (ii) any Tax
imposed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), or (iii) any
state, local or foreign Tax imposed on Target Company's gain, provided,
however, Sellers will not be liable for, and their indemnification obligations
under this Agreement will not apply to any (y) Taxes to the extent such Taxes
are taken into account in the Closing Adjustment and (z) Taxes imposed on a
Target Company resulting from actions, decisions or elections undertaken or
made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Target Companies) after
Closing without Key Seller's written consent which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; (B) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Target Company (or any
predecessor of any of the Target Companies) is or was a member on or prior to
the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
or any analogous or similar state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation; (C)
all Taxes of any Person (other than any Target Company) imposed on any Target
Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law,
rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing Date;

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) the failure of any representation or warranty stated in
_Article III_ (other than the Fundamental Representations stated therein and
the representations and warranties stated in _Section 3.15_ (Tax Returns;
Taxes)) to be true and correct as of the Effective Date and the Closing Date
(or in the case of such representations and warranties that are as of a
specific date, the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct as of such specified date);

 



 

(iii) the failure of any of the Fundamental Representations stated in
_Article III_ and/or any of the representations and warranties stated in
_Section 3.15_ (Tax Returns; Taxes) to be true and correct as of the Effective
Date and the Closing Date (or, in the case of such representations and
warranties that are as of a specified date, the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct as of such specified
date);

 



 

(iv) items (i), (ii), (iii), (vii) and/or (viii) (and (xi) solely as
it relates to such items) under the definition of Company Indebtedness and
Seller Transaction Expenses which are not fully repaid on the Closing Date or
deducted from the Purchase Price;

 



 

(v) all items and events set forth on _Schedule 8.2(a)(v)_ ; and/or

 



 

(vi) any breach by Energy Constructors of _Section 6.15_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, each Seller will, severally but not jointly,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from and against all
Damages actually asserted against or actually incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee
as a result of or arising out of:

 



 

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of such Seller
stated in _Article IV_ (other than the Fundamental Representations stated
therein) to be true and correct as of the Effective Date and the Closing Date
(or, in the case of such representations and warranties that are as of a
specific date, the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct as of such specified date);

 



 

(ii) the failure of any of the Fundamental Representations stated in
_Article IV_ to be true and correct as of the Effective Date and the Closing
Date (or, in the case of such representations and warranties that are as of a
specific date, the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct as of such specified date); and/or

 



 

(iii) any breach by such Seller of any of such Seller's covenants
and agreements stated herein.

 



 

(c) Each Seller's obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for
Damages under _Sections 8.2(a)_ and _8.2(b)_ is subject to the following
limitations and requirements:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) No indemnification will be made by any Seller pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages
incurred by or asserted against any Buyer Indemnitee that are indemnifiable
hereunder (and are the subject of a written notice as provided in this
_Section 8.2_ ) exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (such dollar
amount being referred to as the "Basket"), and, if the aggregate amount of
such Damages exceeds the Basket, Sellers will in accordance with their Pro
Rata Percentage indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for the aggregate amount of
all such Damages in excess of the Basket (but subject to any other applicable
limitations hereunder).

 



 

(ii) The following sublimits of liability shall apply to Sellers'
indemnification obligations hereunder:

 



 

(A) Subject to any other applicable limitations hereunder, each
Seller's aggregate indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(ii)_ will be limited to its Pro Rata Percentage of Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the "Cap Amount"), which amount is
included in, counts toward and is not incremental to such Seller's overall
limit of liability provided for in _Section 8.2(c)(ii)(B)_; and

 



 

(B) Subject to any other applicable limitations hereunder, the
aggregate liability of each Seller pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ will be
limited to an amount equal to such Seller's Pro Rata Percentage multiplied by
the Closing Payment.

 



 

(iii) Each Seller (each a "Seller Indemnifying Party") will be
obligated to indemnify a Buyer Indemnitee under this _Section 8.2_ only for
those Claims for Damages as to which a Buyer Indemnitee has given such Seller
Indemnifying Party written notice (1) promptly (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days) after becoming aware of the facts giving rise to such
Claim and (2) in any event prior to the end of the applicable Survival Period.
Failure to timely provide such written notice shall not affect the right of
the Buyer Indemnitee's, except to the extent the Seller Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such delay or omission. Any written notice delivered by a Buyer
Indemnitee to such Seller Indemnifying Party with respect to Damages will set
forth with reasonable specificity the basis of the claim for Damages if
reasonably determinable at such time, and to the extent practicable, the
amount of Damages claimed. Subject to the procedures with respect to Third-
Party Claims under _Section 8.5_ , if such written notice (or an amended
notice) states the amount of Damages claimed and the applicable Seller
Indemnifying Party notifies the applicable Buyer Indemnitee that such Seller
Indemnifying Party does not dispute the Claim described in such written notice
or fails to notify such Buyer Indemnitee within thirty (30) Business Days
after delivery of such notice by such Buyer Indemnitee whether such Seller
Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim described in such notice, Damages in the
amount specified (but subject to the applicable indemnification limits) in
such notice will be deemed agreed to by such Seller Indemnifying Party, and
such Seller Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the payment of such
Damages to such Buyer Indemnitee, unless Damages in respect of such Claim,
once determined, are less than the amount specified in the written notice, in
which event such Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to recover such lesser
amount (subject to the applicable indemnification limits). If the applicable
Seller Indemnifying Party has timely disputed liability with respect to such
Claim (each, a "Seller Disputed Claim"), Buyer and such Seller Indemnifying
Party will proceed in good faith for a period of up to thirty (30) days to
attempt to negotiate a resolution of such Seller Disputed Claim. If a written
notice does not state the amount of Damages claimed, such omission will not
preclude the Buyer Indemnitee from recovering from such Seller Indemnifying
Party the amount of Damages with respect to the claim described in such notice
if any such amount is not reasonably determinable at the time of delivery of
such notice and it is promptly provided to such Seller Indemnifying Party once
determined.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Subject to the procedures and limitations set forth in this
_Section 8.2_ , the applicable Seller Indemnifying Party will pay or cause to
be paid the amount of any Damages to the applicable Buyer Indemnitee(s) within
five (5) Business Days following the determination of an indemnifying party's
liability for, and the amount of, such Damages (whether such determination is
made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Article VIII_, by
agreement between the applicable Buyer Indemnitee and such Seller Indemnifying
Party, or by a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Damages that a Buyer Indemnitee is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ shall be payable solely
from the Escrow Account, and (ii) any other payment that Sellers are obligated
to make to any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ will be
satisfied first, to the extent there are sufficient funds in the Escrow
Account, by release of funds to such Buyer Indemnitee from the Escrow Account
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
then, to the extent the Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay any remaining
amounts due, or the Escrow Account no longer then exists, Sellers will be
required to pay all of such additional sums due and owing to such Buyer
Indemnitee in accordance with and subject to the terms and limitations of this
_Article VIII_. Key Seller will cooperate expeditiously with Buyer to prepare
and execute written instructions to Escrow Agent necessary to effectuate the
release of any funds from the Escrow Account as required hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Damages that a Buyer
Indemnitee is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ , in the event
that the Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay any such Damages due, or the
Escrow Account no longer then exists and a Seller (a "Non-Performing Seller")
does not pay its Pro Rata Percentage of such Damages (the "Missing Payment")
within five (5) Business Days following the determination of such Non-
Performing Seller's liability for, and the amount of, the Missing Payment,
then Key Seller will pay the Missing Payment on behalf of the Non-Performing
Seller to the applicable Buyer Indemnitee, _provided_ that Key Seller shall be
entitled to seek reimbursement from such Non-Performing Seller for such
payment. Buyer may, upon Buyer's election in its sole discretion, require any
other payment that any Seller is obligated to make to any Buyer Indemnitee
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ to be paid by release of funds to Buyer from the
Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that the funds to be released from the Escrow
Account with respect to the obligation of any Seller shall not exceed such
Seller's Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow Account.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.3 _Buyer 's Agreement to Indemnify_ _._

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Buyer Parties will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless
each Seller and its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from
and against all Damages actually asserted against or actually incurred by any
Seller Indemnitee as a result of or arising out of:

 



 

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty stated in
_Article V_ (other than the Fundamental Representations stated therein) to be
true and correct as of the Effective Date and the Closing Date (or, in the
case of such representations and warranties that are as of a specific date,
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as
of such specified date);

 



 

(ii) the failure of any of the Fundamental Representations stated in
_Article V_ to be true and correct as of the Effective Date and the Closing
Date (or, in the case of such representations and warranties that are as of a
specific date, the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct as of such specified date); and/or

 



 

(iii) any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of Buyer or
Parent stated herein.

 



 

(b) Buyer will, and Parent will cause Buyer to, pay or cause to be
paid the amount of any Damages to the Seller Indemnitee(s) within five (5)
Business Days following the determination of Buyer's liability for and the
amount of Damages (whether such determination is made pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this _Article VIII_ , by agreement between Buyer and
the Seller Indemnitee, or to the extent determined by a final judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction).

 



 

Section 8.4 _Calculation of Damages_.

 



 

(a) All Damages hereunder will be determined net of any (i) Third-
Party Awards; (ii) any actual tax savings arising from such Damages, in each
case, to the extent realized by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee; and (iii) any amount that specifically pertains to such Damages to
the extent such amount is reflected in the calculation of Final Working
Capital Value. With respect to any indemnification claim with respect to
Damages some portion or all of which the applicable Buyer Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee may reasonably be entitled to recover pursuant to a Third-Party
Award, such Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, will
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and recover such Third-Party
Award; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require any indemnified party to
seek, obtain or maintain any policy of insurance or shall require any Buyer
Indemnitee to pursue an Action against a customer or supplier of the Business
or against any employee, officer or director of Buyer or the Target Companies.

 



 

(b) NO PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT FOR ANY PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT
DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, DIMINUTION OF VALUE, LOSS OF FUTURE
REVENUE, PROFITS OR INCOME, OR LOSS OR BUSINESS REPUTATION OR OPPORTUNITY
RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE RESTRICTION
SET FORTH IN THE FOREGOING SENTENCE DOES NOT APPLY, HOWEVER, TO A THIRD PARTY
CLAIM THAT INCLUDES SUCH DAMAGES.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Third-Party Claims_.
Claims for indemnification by Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees under
this Agreement and resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties
(each, a "Third-Party Claim"), will be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

 



 

(a) Any party against whom any Third-Party Claim is asserted will
give the indemnifying party written notice of any such Third-Party Claim
promptly (but in no event later than ten (10) days) after learning of such
Third-Party Claim. Failure to timely provide such written notice shall not
affect the right of a party to indemnification, except to the extent the
indemnifying party is prejudiced by such delay or omission. The indemnifying
party may, at its option, undertake the defense of such Third-Party Claim by
representatives of its own choosing which are reasonably acceptable to the
indemnified party, _provided, however_ , that the indemnifying party may not
undertake the defense of Third-Party Claims solely related to or seeking non-
monetary relief or Third-Party Claims that solely involve criminal
allegations, in each case unless the indemnified party does not defend,
contest or settle such Third-Party Claim, in which event the indemnifying
party may contest and defend (but not settle) such Third-Party Claim. Notice
of intention so to contest and defend will be given by the indemnifying party
to the indemnified party within twenty (20) Business Days after the
indemnified party provides a notice of Third-Party Claim (but in all events,
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date that an answer to such
Third-Party Claim is due to be filed). If the indemnifying party fails to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim within the required time period,
the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, against
whom such Third-Party Claim has been made will (upon further notice to the
indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense of such Third-
Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the expense, of
the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the indemnifying party to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise or final determination of such Third-Party Claim. The indemnifying
party, whether or not it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as
provided in this Agreement, shall not, without the prior written consent of
the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, settle, or consent to the settlement of or consent to
the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the indemnified party may grant or withhold its consent in
its sole discretion if (i) such judgment or settlement does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by all indemnifying parties and all
claimants or plaintiffs to the indemnified party a complete release from all
liability, obligations, conditions or restrictions in respect of such Third-
Party Claim or (ii) such judgment or settlement would result in the finding or
admission of any violation of Law. The indemnified party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle, or consent to the
settlement of or consent to the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying party may grant or
withhold its consent in its sole discretion if such judgment or settlement
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by all
indemnified parties and claimants or plaintiffs to the indemnifying party a
complete release from all liability, obligations, conditions or restrictions
in respect of such Third-Party Claim. If the indemnifying party assumes such
defense, the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be,
will have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense (which expense will not constitute Damages unless
the indemnifying party has not employed counsel to assume the defense of such
action within a reasonable time, and only to the extent that such expenses are
reasonable), separate from the counsel employed by the Buyer Indemnitee or the
Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party will control such defense; provided that if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel there is a conflict of interest between the
indemnifying party and the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the
case may be, the indemnifying party shall be responsible for the reasonable
fees and expenses of separate counsel for the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, in connection with such defense.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The indemnifying party and the Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee, as applicable, will provide each other such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested and at the expense of the indemnifying party in all
aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise,
settlement or discharge of any Third-Party Claim in respect of which indemnity
is sought under this _Article VIII_ , including, but not limited to, by
providing the other party with reasonable access to employees and officers
(including as witnesses) and other information.

 



 

Section 8.6 _No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification
under this Agreement will be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of any state of facts (a) giving rise to such liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, or
(b) taken into account in determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.5_.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any
provision hereof, the Buyer Parties, on behalf of themselves and the other
Buyer Indemnitees, agree that, except with respect to (a) claims arising from
fraud or intentional misconduct or (b) equity claims arising from a breach of
Section 6.7 or any other covenant of Sellers which survives the Closing Date,
the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer Parties from and after the Closing
Date, on behalf of themselves and the other Buyer Indemnitees, against Sellers
with respect to (i) this Agreement and (ii) the events giving rise to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be limited
to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII, and all
other rights and remedies in respect of such a breach or breaches ("Other
Rights and Remedies") by Sellers are hereby expressly forever waived. Buyer
Parties, on behalf of themselves and the other Buyer Indemnitees, hereby
covenant not to sue or seek indemnification from Sellers in connection with
any Other Rights and Remedies.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Cooperation; Access to Records_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer to,
and Buyer shall cause the Target Companies to, provide reasonable cooperation
to Sellers and its advisors and representatives in connection with Sellers'
investigation of or response to any claim for indemnification by a Buyer
Indemnitee under this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against
or incurred by Sellers (as it relates to the Target Companies), for a period
of seven (7) years after the Closing, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause
Buyer to, and Buyer shall cause the Target Companies to, (i) retain the books
and records of the Target Companies relating to periods prior to the Closing
and (ii) afford Key Seller reasonable access at its expense (including the
right to make, at Sellers' expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such books and records.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Effect of Knowledge of Breach_. The Buyer Parties
acknowledge that they have had the opportunity to conduct due diligence and
investigation with respect to the Target Companies, and in no event shall the
Sellers have any liability to Buyer Parties with respect to a breach of
representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement (or the performance
of obligations under this Agreement) to the extent that Buyer Parties had as
of the date of this Agreement actual knowledge of such breach, or had actual
knowledge of the facts and circumstances constituting such breach and knew
such facts and circumstances constituted a breach.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Key Seller and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Key Seller or Buyer at any time after August 30, 2013 (the
"Termination Date"), if the Closing shall not have occurred by such date;
_provided_ , that a Party will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_ if such Party's failure to comply fully
with its obligations under this Agreement has prevented the Closing from
occurring;

 



 

(c) by Buyer, if

 



 

(i) Sellers have breached any (A) covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement in any material respect or (B) any representation or warranty
of Sellers contained in this Agreement, which breach has caused or is

the event of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
that is reasonably capable of being cured, notice of the breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has been delivered by Buyer
and Sellers do not cure such breach by the earlier to occur of the fifteenth
(15th) Business Day after receipt of such notice or the Termination Date; or

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section
7.2_ have become impossible to satisfy; _provided_ , that Buyer will not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ if
Buyer's or Parent's breach of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder is
the principle reason that any such conditions have become impossible to
satisfy; or

 



 

 



   



 

(d) by Key Seller, if

 



 

(i) Buyer or Parent has breached any (A) covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement in any material respect or (B) any representation

more of the covenants or agreements (but not representations or warranties)
stated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations
provided for in _Section 6.8_ (Public Announcements), _Section 10.10_

ARTICLE X 

GENERAL

 



 

Section 10.1 _Amendments_. This Agreement and any Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement may be amended only by agreement in writing signed
by Buyer and Key Seller.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Exhibits; Schedules; Integration_. Each exhibit and
schedule delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be in writing
and will constitute a part of this Agreement, although such exhibits and
schedules need not be attached to each copy of this Agreement. This Agreement,
together with such exhibits and schedules, constitutes the entire agreement
among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings of the Parties in connection therewith,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 25, 2013,
between the Limited Partnership and Parent.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties will
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choices or conflict of law provision or
rules thereof, and except to the extent that certain matters are preempted by
federal law or are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of
the respective Parties.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought and determined in any federal court in Delaware (or to
the extent any such federal court does not have jurisdiction, any state court
sitting in Delaware) and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any legal
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further
agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Parties to
obtain execution of judgment in any other jurisdiction. The Parties further
agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and unappealable judgment
against a Party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the
United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment. Except to the
extent that a different determination or finding is mandated due to the
applicable Law being that of a different jurisdiction, the Parties agree that
all judicial determinations or findings by a state or federal court in
Delaware with respect to any matter under this Agreement shall be binding.

 



 

(c) To the extent that any Party hereto has or hereafter may acquire
any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in this _Section 10.3_. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
court, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court.

 



 

THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY

 



 

Section 10.4 _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of
any term or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction will
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the
remaining terms and provisions will remain in full force and effect, unless
doing so would result in an interpretation of this Agreement which is
manifestly unjust.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 10.5 _No Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights
or obligations under it will be assignable, except with the prior written
consent of the other Party or Parties, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the Articles,
Sections and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendment hereto
or any of the other documents delivered pursuant hereto may be executed in one
or more counterparts and by different Parties in separate counterparts. All of
such counterparts will constitute one and the same agreement (or other
document) and will become effective (unless otherwise provided therein) when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the
other Parties.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to relieve or discharge the obligation
of any third Person to any Party.

Section 10.11 _Appointment of Key Seller as Sellers ' Representative_
_._

 



 

(a) Each Seller constitutes and appoints Key Seller as its
representative and its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power and
authority in its name and on its behalf:

 



 

(i) to act on such Seller's behalf in the absolute discretion of
Key Seller with respect to all matters relating to any Transaction Document,
including (A) execution and delivery of any amendment, supplement, or
modification of this Agreement, (B) any waiver of any claim or right arising
out of any Transaction Document, and (C) any action contemplated hereby as to
be taken by Key Seller;

 



 

(ii) in general, to do all things and to perform all acts, including
executing and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions,
and other instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 10.11_; and

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to interpret
all of the terms and provisions of any Transaction Document, to compromise any
claims asserted hereunder and to authorize any release of the consideration to
be made with respect thereto, on behalf of Sellers and their successors, and
to incur expenses on behalf of Sellers and their successors.

 



 

This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest
and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement and is
irrevocable and will not be terminated by any act of any Seller or by
operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Seller or by the
occurrence of any other event. Each Seller hereby consents to the taking of
any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to
be taken or made by Key Seller pursuant to this _Section 10.11_. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of Key Seller constitutes a decision of all
Sellers. Each Seller agrees that Key Seller shall have no obligation or
liability to any Person for any action taken or omitted by Key Seller in good
faith as Sellers' representative, and each Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Key Seller from, and shall pay to Key Seller the amount of, or
reimburse Key Seller for, any Damages that Key Seller may suffer, sustain, or
become subject to as a result of any such action or omission by Key Seller as
Sellers' representative under this Agreement. Key Seller shall incur no
liability to Sellers with respect to any action taken or suffered by Key
Seller in reliance upon any note, direction, instruction, consent, statement
or other documents believed by Key Seller to be genuinely and duly authorized.
Key Seller may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the
advice of counsel and Key Seller shall not be liable to Sellers for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by Key Seller based on such advice.
Key Seller shall be reimbursed by Sellers (pro rata, based on their Pro Rata
Percentage) for Key Seller's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
serving as Sellers' representative.

 



 

(b) Buyer and Parent shall be entitled to rely upon any document or
other paper delivered by Key Seller as being authorized by Sellers, and Buyer
and Parent shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by Buyer or Parent based on such reliance.

 



 

(c) Until all obligations under this Agreement shall have been
discharged, Sellers (or their successors) who, immediately prior to the
Closing, are entitled in the aggregate to receive more than 50% of the
Purchase Price, may, from time to time upon notice to Buyer, appoint a new
Sellers' representative upon the death, incapacity, or resignation of Key
Seller. All power, authority, rights and privileges conferred herein to Key
Seller shall apply to any successor Seller' representative.

 



 

(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in any dispute or
Action arising under or in connection with this Agreement following the
Closing, each Seller, including Key Seller in its capacity as Sellers'
representative, shall have the right, at such Person's election, to retain
Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP to represent such Person in such matter. Each of
Buyer, Parent, the General Partner, the Limited Partnership, for itself and on
behalf of its respective affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby waives any
actual or potential conflicts of interests arising from any such
representation and hereby consents to any such representation in any such
matter.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that the other Parties would be irreparably injured if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms and that money damages may not or would not be an adequate
remedy in such event. Therefore, notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary and in addition to any other remedy available to a Party
hereunder, whether before or after the Closing Date, the non-breaching Party
will be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement and injunctive or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the provisions hereof.
