in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Parent may have an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not
seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Parent&#146;s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, Parent shall have the right to
inform any third party that Parent reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Parent
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholder&#146;s agreement with Parent set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Parent against such third party. </FONT></P> <P
