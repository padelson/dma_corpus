ARTICLE III



MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



3.01  _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any Person:



(a) _Outstanding Hawthorne Common Stock_. Each share of Hawthorne Common
Stock, excluding Treasury Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become and be converted into 1.45 shares of Parent
Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio").



(b) _Outstanding Parent Common Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding and shall be unaffected by the Merger.



(c) _Outstanding Acquisition Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Acquisition Sub
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding and shall be unaffected by the Merger.



(d) _Treasury Stock_. Each share of Hawthorne Common Stock held as Treasury
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.



3.02 _Deposit of Parent Common Stock_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an agent,
duly appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Hawthorne (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article III, certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be
issued pursuant to Sections 3.01(a) and 3.05 in the Merger in exchange for
outstanding shares of Hawthorne Common Stock.



3.03 _Exchange Procedures_.



 

(a) At or after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or
Certificates, upon surrender of the same to the Exchange Agent, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates  



 

8  representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the shares of Hawthorne Common Stock theretofore represented by the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall have been converted as
provided in Section 3.01(a) hereof and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided in Section 3.05 hereof. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business Days after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of an
outstanding Certificate which is to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock as
provided in Section 3.01(a) hereof, a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
such Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate to the
Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the terms of the exchange effected by
the Merger and of the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such
Certificate in exchange for a certificate or certificates evidencing Parent
Common Stock or cash in lieu of any fractional share interest. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Certificates surrendered for
exchange by any Hawthorne Affiliate shall not be exchanged for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement until Parent has received an Affiliate Letter from such person
as specified in Section 6.07.



(b) No holder of a Certificate shall be entitled to receive any dividends in
respect of the Parent Common Stock into which such shares shall have been
converted by virtue of the Merger until the Certificate representing such
shares is surrendered in exchange for a certificate or certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock. In the event that dividends are
declared and paid by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock after the
Effective Time but prior to any holders surrender of Certificates, dividends
payable to such holder in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock not then
issued shall accrue (without interest). Any such dividends shall be paid
(without interest) upon surrender of the Certificates. Parent shall be
entitled, after the Effective Time, to treat Certificates as evidencing
ownership of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the
shares of Hawthorne Common Stock represented by such Certificates shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement, notwithstanding the failure on the
part of the holder thereof to surrender such Certificates.



(c) The Exchange Agent and Parent, as the case may be, shall not be obligated
to deliver a certificate or certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock to which a holder of Hawthorne Common Stock would otherwise be entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or
Certificates representing the shares of Hawthorne Common Stock for exchange
as provided in this Section 3.03, or, in default thereof, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be
reasonably required in each case by Parent. If any certificates evidencing
shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate evidencing Hawthorne Common Stock surrendered in
exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required
by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.



3.04 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time,
holders of Hawthorne Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, stockholders of Hawthorne other than to receive the consideration provided
under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of Hawthorne or the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Hawthorne Common Stock.



3.05 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Hawthorne
Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered
by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled by the closing price of a share of Parent
Common Stock on Nasdaq on the business day preceding the  



 

9  Effective Time (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , or if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded to the nearest
whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share.



3.06 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
reorganization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or
similar transaction with respect to Parent Common Stock, or a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date or ex dividend or
distribution date within said period, the Exchange Ratio, the Starting Price
and the Parent Closing Average shall be adjusted accordingly. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated herein, Parent and Hawthorne agree that the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to 1.9333 and the Starting Price shall be
adjusted to $19.61 when the four for three stock split of Parent Common Stock
declared on January 23, 2004 is effected, subject to further adjustment as
provided in this Section 3.06.



3.07  _Withholding Rights_. Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Hawthorne Common Stock such amounts as Parent is required under the Code or
any state, local or foreign tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Hawthorne Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent.



3.08 _Hawthorne Options and Hawthorne Warrants_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each vested Hawthorne Option which is then
outstanding, and which is then vested and exercisable without regard to the
Merger, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Hawthorne Common
Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares
of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Hawthorne Option,
in accordance with the terms of the Hawthorne Stock Option Plan and stock
option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after
the Effective Time, (i) Parent and the Compensation Committee of its Board of
Directors shall be substituted for Hawthorne and the committee of the Board
of Directors of Hawthorne (including, if applicable, the entire Board of
Directors of Hawthorne) administering such Hawthorne Stock Option Plan, (ii)
each Hawthorne Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to such Hawthorne Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Hawthorne
Common Stock subject to such Hawthorne Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be
rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the per share exercise
price under each such Hawthorne Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per
share exercise price under each such Hawthorne Option by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.
Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each
Hawthorne Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as
required by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of
the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. Each Hawthorne
Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time but which
is not vested and exercisable except as a result of the Merger shall not be
assumed by Parent or otherwise continued in effect following the Effective
Time, and, therefore, in accordance with the terms of the Hawthorne Stock
Option Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced,
each such Hawthorne Option shall become fully vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall terminate and cease to be
outstanding at the Effective Time. Parent and Hawthorne agree to take all
necessary steps to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.08(a).
As of the Effective Time, Parent shall issue to each holder of an outstanding
Hawthorne Option which has been assumed by Parent a document evidencing the
conversion and assumption of the Hawthorne Option by Parent pursuant to this
Section 3.08(a).



 

10 (b) At the Effective Time, each Hawthorne Warrant which is then outstanding,
whether or not vested or exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Hawthorne Common Stock and shall be converted automatically
into a warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall
assume each Hawthorne Warrant, in accordance with the terms of the Hawthorne
Warrant or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and
after the Effective Time, (i) each Hawthorne Warrant assumed by Parent may be
exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to such Hawthorne Warrant shall be equal to the
number of shares of Hawthorne Common Stock subject to such Hawthorne Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iii) the per
share exercise price under each such Hawthorne Warrant shall be adjusted by
dividing the per share exercise price under each such Hawthorne Warrant by
the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to
the nearest cent. Parent and Hawthorne agree to take all necessary steps to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.08(b), including without
limitation the mailing by Parent by first class, U.S. mail, postage prepaid,
to each holder of a Hawthorne Warrant of a written instrument setting forth
Parents agreement to assume such Hawthorne Warrants.



(c) Within ten Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
Hawthorne Warrants referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 3.08, and a
registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Hawthorne Options referred to in Section 3.08(a),
and in each case shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so long as such
options remain outstanding in the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case of a Form
S-3, until the shares subject to such Hawthorne Options or the Hawthorne
Warrants may be sold without a further holding period under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees
that at the Effective Time, it will be bound by and assume all obligations of
Hawthorne under the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of December 12,
1995 by and among Hawthorne and each of the Investors (as such term is defined
in such Registration Rights Agreement) (the "Registration Rights Agreement").



3.09 _Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Hawthorne and Parent shall cause Hawthorne Bank and Parent Bank to
enter into the Bank Merger Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as
Annex D, which provides for the merger of Hawthorne Bank with and into Parent
Bank (the "Bank Merger"), in accordance with applicable laws and regulations
and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement and as soon as practicable after
consummation of the Merger and the Acquisition Sub Merger. The Bank Merger
Agreement provides that the directors of Parent Bank upon consummation of the
Bank Merger shall be the directors of Parent Bank immediately prior to the
Bank Merger, plus the three Hawthorne Designees.

response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Section 5.03, 5.04 or 5.05 or to one or more of its covenants contained in
Article IV; provided, however, that (a) no such item is required to be set
forth in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
or as an exception to a covenant in Article IV if its absence would not be
reasonably likely to result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 5.02 and
(b) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such item is or would
be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 



5.02 _Standard_. No representation or warranty of Hawthorne, Parent or
Acquisition Sub contained in Sections 5.03, 5.04 or 5.05, respectively, shall
be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no party hereto shall be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence
of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Sections 5.03,

Effect on the party making such representation or warranty.

(i) Except for documents listed as exhibits to Hawthornes Securities
Documents or as Previously Disclosed, neither Hawthorne nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with

business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its
respective assets, business, or operations receives benefits, and there has

no power of attorney or similar authorization given directly or indirectly by
Hawthorne or any of its Subsidiaries is currently outstanding.



(l) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by Hawthorne or any of its
Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto

ONeill and Partners, L.P.



(m)  _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees of Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries (the
"Employees") and current or former directors of Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation, stock option, stock
purchase, stock  



 

19  appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the "Benefit

and insurance contracts forming a part of any Benefit Plans and all amendments
thereto; (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), together with all
schedules, as required, filed with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or
Department of Labor (the "DOL"), as applicable, and any financial statements

Benefit Plan; (C) for each Benefit Plan which is a "top-hat" plan, a copy of
filings with the DOL; (D) the most recent determination letter issued by the

made available to Parent.



(ii) Each Benefit Plan has been administered to date in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and applicable
law and with the terms and provisions of all documents, contracts or
agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is maintained. Each Benefit
Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, and Hawthorne is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither Hawthorne nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any correspondence or written or verbal notice from
the IRS, DOL, any other governmental agency, any participant in
or beneficiary of, a Benefit Plan, or any agent representing any of the
foregoing that brings into question the qualification of any such Benefit
Plan. There is no material pending or, to Hawthornes knowledge, threatened
litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither Hawthorne nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan or
Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject Hawthorne or any of its Subsidiaries to a
tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA in an amount which would be material. There are no matters pending
before the IRS, DOL or other governmental agency with respect to any Benefit
Plan.



(iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Hawthorne or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with Hawthorne under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code
(an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither Hawthorne nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred, and neither expects to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect
to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be
filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the l2-month
period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection
with the Transaction.



(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan
have been timely made or have been reflected on the financial statements of
Hawthorne included in Hawthornes Securities Documents. Neither any Pension
Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding
funding waiver. Except as Previously Disclosed, neither Hawthorne nor any of
its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under
any Benefit Plan, other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or under the continuation of
coverage provisions of the laws of any state or locality. Hawthorne or any of
its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such Benefit Plan in accordance
with and to the extent permitted by their terms at any time without incurring
any liability thereunder. No event or condition exists with respect to a
Benefit Plan that could subject Hawthorne to a material tax under Section
4980B of the Code.



(vi) None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement or consummation of the Transaction will except as Previously
Disclosed, (A) entitle any employees of Hawthorne or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans,
(C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the
Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment that would be a "parachute payment"
to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of
the Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation
for personal services performed or to be performed in the future.



(vii) All required reports and descriptions (including but not limited to Form
5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual
reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan descriptions) have been filed or
distributed appropriately with respect to each Benefit Plan. All required tax
filings with respect to each Benefit Plan have been made, and any taxes due

to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor

National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel Hawthorne or any of its
Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions
of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or
any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to Hawthornes knowledge, threatened, nor
is Hawthorne or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any activity involving its

the ownership, use, or transfer of any property pursuant to any Environmental
Law, or adversely affect the value of any Hawthorne Loan Property; and (viii)

this Section 6.06 shall be subject to, and such receiving party shall hold all
such information in confidence in accordance with the provisions of the
respective Confidentiality Agreements, dated as of December 11, 2003 and
November 26, 2003 between Parent and Hawthorne (each, a "Confidentiality
Agreement").



6.07 _Affiliates_. Hawthorne shall use its reasonable best efforts to identify
those persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Hawthorne within the
meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (the
"Hawthorne Affiliates") and to cause each person so identified to deliver to
Parent as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the date
of Hawthorne Meeting, a written agreement to comply with the requirements of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act in connection with the sale or other
transfer of Parent Common Stock received in the Merger, which agreement shall
be in the form attached hereto as Annex D (the "Affiliate Letter").



6.08  _Acquisition Proposals_.



(a) Each of Hawthorne and Parent agree that it shall, and shall direct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (including without limitation any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it) to, immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the
possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below),
and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including by
requesting the other party to promptly return or destroy any confidential
information previously furnished by such party thereunder. From the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, each of Hawthorne and Parent shall
not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its directors, officers or
employees (and those of any Hawthorne Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiary) or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it (or any Subsidiary) to, directly or indirectly
through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to
facilitate or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any
person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) except
in accordance with Section 8.01(j) in the case of Hawthorne, approve or
recommend, propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase
agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or propose to do any of the
foregoing, or (v) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or
solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
prior to the date of the Hawthorne Meeting or the Parent Meeting, as may be
applicable, if a partys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consulting with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure to
do so would breach, or would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of,
its Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law, such party may, in response
to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation
of this Section 6.08(a) that its Board of Directors believes in  



 

32  good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below), subject to
providing 48 hour prior written notice of its decision to take such action to
the other party and identifying the person making the proposal and all the
material terms and conditions of such proposal and compliance with Section
6.08(b), following delivery of such notice (1) furnish information with
respect to itself and its Subsidiaries to any person making such a Superior
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by
such party after consultation with its outside counsel) on terms no more
favorable to such person than the terms contained in any such agreement
between Hawthorne and Parent, and (2) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such a Superior Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal
or offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice (whether in draft or
final form) or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any
person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes a substantial portion of the net revenues, net
income or assets of Hawthorne or Parent, as the case may be, (x) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of equity securities
representing 10% or more of the voting power of Hawthorne or Parent, as the
case may be, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of equity
securities of Hawthorne or Parent, as the case may be, or (z)
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Hawthorne or Parent, as the case
may be, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Hawthorne Common Stock or
the Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, then outstanding or all or
substantially all of Hawthornes or Parents, as the case may be, consolidated
assets, which after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation) (i) on terms which the Board of Directors of Hawthorne or
Parent, as the case may be, determines in its good faith judgment to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger,
(ii) that constitutes a transaction that, in such Board of Directors good
faith judgment, is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth,
and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or
which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Hawthorne or
Parent, as the case may be, is reasonably likely to be obtained by such third
party.



(b) In addition to the obligations of Hawthorne and Parent, as the case may
be, set forth in Section 6.08(a), each party shall promptly (within 24 hours)
advise the other orally and in writing of its receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal (or any inquiry which could lead to an Acquisition Proposal) and keep
the other informed, on a current basis, of the continuing status thereof and
shall contemporaneously provide to the other all materials provided to or made
available to any third party pursuant to this Section 6.08 which were not
previously provided to the other.



(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Hawthorne and
Parent and its respective Board of Directors shall be permitted to comply with
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934;
provided, however, that compliance with such Rules will in no way limit or
modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have
under this Agreement.



6.09 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, each of Hawthorne and
its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of
the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its
loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves)
so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent;
provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and further
provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by Hawthorne or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.09 shall constitute or be deemed
to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this  



 

33  Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach,
violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any
such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously
furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as
concurrence of Hawthorne or its management with any such adjustments.



6.10 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger.



6.11 _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of Hawthorne
or a Hawthorne Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time
(the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she
was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Hawthorne or any
Hawthorne Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of Hawthorne or any
of the Hawthorne Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the
Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would
be entitled under the Hawthorne Certificate and the Hawthorne Bylaws or
equivalent documents of any Hawthorne Subsidiary, as applicable, or any
agreement, arrangement or understanding which has been Previously Disclosed by
Hawthorne pursuant to this Section, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof.



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except
that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay,
promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one
firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the persons serving as
directors and officers of Hawthorne immediately prior to the Effective Time to
be covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy
maintained by Hawthorne for a period of six years after the Effective Time
(provided that Parent may substitute therefore policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not materially
less advantageous than such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy
limits equal to Hawthornes existing coverage limits) with respect to acts or
omissions occurring  



 

34  prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and
officers in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall Parent
be required to expend for any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by Hawthorne for such insurance (the "Insurance
Amount"), and further provided that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain
the insurance called for by this Section 6.11(c) as a result of the preceding
provision, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the most
advantageous coverage as is available for the Insurance Amount.



(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by each of the Indemnified Parties and his or her
heirs.



6.12 _Benefit Plans_.



(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of Hawthorne and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Parent of general applicability (the "Parent Benefit
Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of Hawthorne
and its Subsidiaries in the Parent Benefit Plans may occur at different times
with respect to different plans), provided that coverage shall be
continued under corresponding Benefit Plans of Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries
until such employees are permitted to participate in the Parent Benefit Plans
and provided further, however, that nothing contained herein shall require
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee
of Hawthorne under any discretionary equity compensation plan of Parent.
Parent shall cause each Parent Benefit Plan in which employees of Hawthorne
and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits and for
all other purposes (but not for accrual of pension benefits) under the Parent
Benefit Plans, the service of such employees with Hawthorne and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by Hawthorne, provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits. Except for the commitment to continue those Benefit Plans of
Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries that correspond to Parent Benefit Plans until
employees of Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries are included in such Parent
Benefit Plans, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent to amend or
terminate any of Hawthornes Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the
extent permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such terms.



(b) At and following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with
their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current
and former employees of Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries and current and former
directors of Hawthorne and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective
Date, as well as all employment, severance, deferred compensation, split
dollar, supplemental retirement or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or
policies of Hawthorne which are Previously Disclosed. The severance or
termination payments which are payable pursuant to such agreements, plans or
policies of Hawthorne (which have been quantified in reasonable detail) have
been Previously Disclosed.



(c) At such time as employees and current and former directors of Hawthorne
and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or
health plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause each such plan
to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent
such conditions covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans
of Parent, (ii) provide full credit under such plans for any deductibles, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and directors and
their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
or director on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or
director had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.



6.13 _Parent Board_. (a) Parent agrees to take all action necessary to appoint
or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, Timothy R. Chrisman, Gary W.
Brummett and Anthony W. Liberati (the "Hawthorne  



 

35  Designees") as directors of Parent. Such persons shall serve until the first
annual meeting of stockholders of Parent following the Effective Time
and until his successor is elected and qualified. Subject to the fiduciary
duties of the Parent Board, Parent shall include the Hawthorne Designees on
the list of nominees for director presented by the Parent Board and for which
the Parent Board shall solicit proxies at the first annual meeting of
stockholders of Parent following the Effective Time (the "Parent 2005 Annual
Meeting"). At the Parent 2005 Annual Meeting, Parent shall re-classify the
Parent Board into three classes and, subject to the fiduciary duties of the
Parent Board, Parent undertakes to have one of each of the Hawthorne Designees
represented in each of such classes. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the
Parent Board, Parent agrees that to the extent that one or more of the
Hawthorne Designees dies or becomes incapacitated prior to the Effective Time,
the remaining Hawthorne Designees may recommend to the Parent Board a person
to serve as successor, and provided that such person is reasonably
acceptable to the Parent Board, such person shall be appointed to fill the
vacancy so created. If, during the initial term prior to the Parent 2005
Annual Meeting or the term immediately following the Parent 2005 Annual
Meeting, any one of the Hawthorne Designees vacates the seat they have been
elected to for any reason, Parent agrees, subject to the fiduciary duties of
the Parent Board, to appoint Harry Radcliffe to replace that director,
provided that at the time of such appointment, Mr. Radcliffe or a member of
his immediate family or a family trust owns at least 100,000 shares of Parent
Common Stock, subject to adjustment as a result of any stock dividend, stock
split, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to
the Parent Common Stock following the Effective Time. Additionally, if during
the first initial term or the longest term that any of the Hawthorne Designees
is elected to at the Parent 2005 Annual Meeting, there is a vacancy that
occurs on the Parent Board, Parent agrees to consider Harry Radcliffe to fill
the vacancy, so long as he as a member of his immediate family or a family
trust continues to own at such time at least 100,000 shares of Parent Common
Stock, subject to adjustment as a result of any stock dividend, stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the Parent Common
Stock following the Effective Time, provided that nothing herein shall
obligate Parent to appoint Mr. Radcliffe to the Parent Board under such
circumstances. In connection with Parents 2004 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, Parent shall take appropriate steps to reduce the size of the
Parent Board by one member such that as of the Effective Time, taking into
consideration the Hawthorne Designees, the Parent Board shall consist of nine
members.



(b) Parent agrees that for a period of one year from the Effective Time, it
shall take no action which would cause any of the Hawthorne Designees to fail
to be an "independent" director for purposes of the Exchange Act, the
regulations promulgated thereunder and the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq
Stock Market ("Nasdaq Rules"). In addition, Parent agrees that from the
Effective Time until the Parent 2005 Annual Meeting, the number of directors
on the Parent Board who are "independent" for purposes of the Exchange Act,
the regulations promulgated thereunder and the Nasdaq Rules shall not be less
than two-thirds of the entire Parent Board.



6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Hawthorne and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein.



6.15 _Regulatory Conditions_. In the event of the imposition of any
conditions, restrictions or requirements in connection with the regulatory
approvals required by Section 7.01(b) which Parent determines
would materially reduce the benefits of the Transaction as provided in
Section 7.01(b), Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the removal of any such condition, restriction or
requirement.



6.16 _Estoppel Letters_. Hawthorne shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing with
respect to all real estate (i) owned by Hawthorne or its Subsidiaries, an
estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in the form of Annex F from all
tenants and (ii) leased by Hawthorne or its Subsidiaries, an estoppel letter
dated as of the Closing in the form of Annex G from all lessors.



 

36 6.17 _Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Assuming that Hawthorne
delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information not less than five Business
Days in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or a
committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution
providing that the receipt by the Hawthorne Insiders of Parent Common Stock in
exchange for shares of Hawthorne Common Stock, and of options and warrants to
purchase Parent Common Stock upon conversion of Hawthorne Options and
Hawthorne Warrants, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information provided by Hawthorne to Parent prior to the Effective Time, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt.



6.18 _Assumption of Indenture Obligation_. Following the Acquisition
Sub Merger, Parent shall execute such supplemental indentures and provide
such documents including without limitation legal opinions, as are reasonably
required upon a merger or consolidation of Hawthorne under the indentures,
trust agreements, guarantee agreements and other agreements entered into by
Hawthorne or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the issuance of
debentures and capital securities by Hawthorne and HFC Capital Trust I, HFC
Capital Trust II, HFC Capital Trust III, and HFC Capital Trust IV.

38 ARTICLE VIII



TERMINATION



8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Transaction may
be abandoned:



(a) _Mutual Consent_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent in writing of Parent and Hawthorne if the Board of Directors of each
so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.



(b) _Breach_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, provided that the
terminating party (or if Parent is the terminating party, Acquisition Sub) is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained therein (subject in all cases to the standard set forth in
Section 5.2), by Parent or Hawthorne, if its Board of Directors so determines
by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event of: (i)
a breach by Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, or Hawthorne, on the
other hand, as the case may be, of any representation or warranty contained
herein (subject to the standard set forth in Section 5.02), which breach
cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written
notice to the breaching party or parties of such breach; or (ii) a breach
by Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, or Hawthorne, on the other
hand, as the case may be, of any of the covenants or agreements contained
herein, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the
giving of written notice to the breaching party or parties of such breach,
which breach (whether under (i) or (ii)) would be reasonably expected,
individually or in the aggregate with other breaches, to result in a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or Hawthorne, as the case may be.



(c)  _Delay_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Parent or
Hawthorne, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of
the members of its entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not
consummated by October 27, 2004, except to the extent that the failure of the
Merger then to be consummated by such date shall be due to (i) the failure of
the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party or Acquisition Sub, in the
case of Parent, set forth in this Agreement or (ii) the failure of any of the
Hawthorne Shareholders (if Hawthorne is the party seeking to terminate) or any
of the Parent Shareholders (if Parent is the party seeking to terminate) to
perform or observe their respective covenants and agreements under the
relevant Hawthorne Shareholder Agreement or Parent Shareholder Agreement.



(d) _No Regulatory Approval_. By Parent or Hawthorne, if its Board of
Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire
Board, in the event the approval of any Governmental Authority required for
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been denied by final nonappealable action of such
Governmental Authority or an application therefor shall have been permanently
withdrawn at the request of a Governmental Authority, provided, however, that
no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.01(d) if such denial shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants of
such party (or Acquisition Sub, in the case of Parent) set forth herein.



(e) _No Hawthorne Stockholder Approval_. By either Parent or Hawthorne, if
any approval of the stockholders of Hawthorne contemplated by this Agreement
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
vote at the Hawthorne Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.



(f) _No Parent Stockholder Approval_. By either Parent or Hawthorne, if any
approval of the stockholders of Parent contemplated by this Agreement shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at
the Parent Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.



(g) _Hawthorne Failure to Recommend_. At any time prior to Hawthorne Meeting,
by Parent if (i) Hawthorne shall have breached Section 6.08 in any respect
materially adverse to Parent, (ii) the Hawthorne Board shall have failed to
make its recommendation referred to in Section 6.02(a), withdrawn such
recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a manner adverse
in any respect to the interests of Parent or (iii) Hawthorne shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 6.02(a) by failing to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Hawthorne Meeting in accordance with
Section 6.02(a).





 

39 (h) _Parent Failure to Recommend_. At any time prior to Parent Meeting, by
Hawthorne if (i) Parent shall have breached Section 6.08 in any respect
materially adverse to Hawthorne, (ii) the Parent Board shall have failed to
make its recommendation referred to in Section 6.02(b), withdrawn such
recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a manner adverse
in any respect to the interests of Hawthorne or (iii) Parent shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 6.02(b) by failing to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Meeting in accordance with
Section 6.02(b).



(i)  _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers_. By Parent if a tender offer or
exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Hawthorne Common
Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the
Hawthorne Board recommends that the stockholders of Hawthorne tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that
such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten-
Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.



(j)  _Superior Proposal_. At any time prior to the Hawthorne Meeting, by
Hawthorne in order to concurrently enter into an acquisition agreement or
similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") with respect to a
Superior Proposal which has been received and considered by Hawthorne and the
Hawthorne Board in compliance with Section 6.08 hereof, provided, however,
that this Agreement may be terminated by Hawthorne pursuant to this Section
8.01(j) only after the fifth Business Day following Hawthornes provision of
written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Hawthorne Board is prepared
to accept a Superior Proposal, and only if, during such five-Business Day
period, Parent does not, in its sole discretion, make an offer to Hawthorne
that the Hawthorne Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable as the Superior
Proposal.



(k) _Possible Adjustment_. By Hawthorne, if the Hawthorne Board so determines
by the vote of a majority of all of its members, at any time during the five-
day period commencing with the Determination Date, if both the following
conditions are satisfied:



(i) The Parent Closing Average shall be less than 80.0% of the Starting Price;
and



(ii) (x) the number obtained by dividing the Parent Closing Average by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (y) the number obtained by dividing the Peer Group Index on
the Determination Date by the Peer Group Starting Index (such number being
referred to herein as the "Index Ratio") by more than 0.20; subject, however,
to the following three sentences. If Hawthorne elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall
give written notice to Parent (provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, Parent shall have the option of increasing the consideration to be
received by the holders of Hawthorne Common Stock hereunder by adjusting the
Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (i) a number equal to a quotient
(rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth), the numerator of which is the
product of the Starting Price, 0.80, and the Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect) and the denominator of which is the Parent Closing Average, and (ii) a
number equal to a quotient (rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth), the
numerator of which is the (A) difference between the Index Ratio and (B)
0.20, multiplied by the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect)
and (2) the Starting Price, and the denominator of which is the Parent Closing
Average. If Parent makes an election contemplated by the preceding sentence
within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Hawthorne
of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.01(k) and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio
shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement to
"Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 8.01(k).



8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._



(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have
any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except as
set forth in this Section 8.02 and Section 9.01.



 

40 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Hawthorne pursuant to
a breach as provided in Section 8.01(b), the breaching party shall promptly
pay to the non-breaching party $4.0 million, without prejudice to any other
rights or remedies as may be available to Parent under Section 8.02(c) below
or Hawthorne under Section 8.02(d) below.



(c) The parties hereto agree that Hawthorne shall pay Parent the sum of $18.0
million (the "Hawthorne Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as
follows:



(i) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or
(i) or by Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.01(j), in either of which case
payment shall be made to Parent on the second Business Day following the
termination of this Agreement; or



(ii) if (x) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to Section
8.01(b), (B) by either Parent or Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and at
the time of such termination no vote of the Hawthorne stockholders
contemplated by this Agreement at the Hawthorne Meeting shall have occurred,
or (C) by either Parent or Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.01(e), and in the
case of any termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C), an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made
known to the senior management of Hawthorne or the Hawthorne Board (or any
Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an
intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of
the stockholders of Hawthorne contemplated by this Agreement at the Hawthorne
Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or the date of termination, in the case of
clause (A) or (B), and (y) within 15 months after such termination Hawthorne
enters into an agreement with respect to a Control Transaction (as defined
below) or consummates a Control Transaction which is the subject of an
Acquisition Proposal, then Hawthorne shall pay to Parent the Hawthorne
Termination Fee on the date of execution of such agreement or consummation of
a Control Transaction which is the subject of an Acquisition Proposal,
provided that if the date of execution of such agreement is after 9 months but
within 15 months after such termination of this Agreement, the Hawthorne
Termination Fee shall be payable by Hawthorne to Parent only upon
consummation of a Control Transaction which is the subject of an Acquisition
Proposal, regardless whether such consummation occurs within 15 months after
termination of this Agreement. As used in this Section 8.02(c)(ii),
a "Control Transaction" means the acquisition by purchase, merger,
consolidation, sale, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any related
series of transactions of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
securities of Hawthorne or Hawthorne Bank or substantially all of the assets
of Hawthorne or Hawthorne Bank.



Any payment previously made to Parent pursuant to Section 8.02(b) shall be
credited against any amount due under 8.02(c)(i) and any payment previously
made to Parent pursuant to Section 8.02(b) or 8.02(c)(i) shall be credited
against any amount due under this Section 8.02(c)(ii), such that in no event
will the amount payable to Parent pursuant to Sections 8.02(b) and (c) exceed
$18.0 million. Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section
8.02(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent.



(d) The parties hereto agree that Parent shall pay Hawthorne the sum of $18.0
million (the "Parent Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as
follows:



(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.01(h),
payment shall be made to Parent on the second Business Day following the
termination of this Agreement; or



(ii) If (x) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Hawthorne pursuant to Section
8.01(b), (B) by either Parent or Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and at
the time of such termination no vote of the Parent stockholders contemplated
by this Agreement at the Parent Meeting shall have occurred, or (C) by either
Parent or Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.01(f), and in the case of any
termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C), an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the
senior management of Parent or the Parent Board (or  



 

41  any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an
intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of
the stockholders of Parent contemplated by this Agreement at the Parent
Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or the date of termination, in the case of
clause (A) or (B), and (y) within 15 months after such termination Parent
enters into an agreement with respect to a Control Transaction (as defined
below) or consummates a Control Transaction which is the subject of an
Acquisition Proposal, then Parent shall pay to Hawthorne the Parent
Termination Fee on the date of execution of such agreement or consummation of
a Control Transaction which is the subject of an Acquisition Proposal,
provided that if the date of execution of such agreement is after 9 months but
within 15 months after such termination of this Agreement, the Parent
Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent to Hawthorne only upon consummation
of a Control Transaction which is the subject of an Acquisition Proposal,
regardless whether such consummation occurs within 15 months after
termination of this Agreement. As used in this Section 8.02(d)(ii), a "Control
Transaction" means the acquisition by purchase, merger, consolidation, sale,
transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any related series of
transactions of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding securities
of Parent or Parent Bank or substantially all of the assets of Parent or
Parent Bank.



Any payment previously made to Hawthorne to Section 8.02(b) shall be credited
against any amount due under 8.02(d)(i) and any payment previously made to
Hawthorne pursuant to Section 8.02(b) or 8.02(d)(i) shall be credited against
any amount due under this Section 8.02(d)(ii), such that in no event will the
amount payable to Hawthorne pursuant to Sections 8.02(b) and (c) exceed $18.0
million. Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(d)
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Hawthorne.



(e) Hawthorne and Parent agree that the agreements contained in paragraphs (c)
and (d) of this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreements Parent and
Hawthorne would not have entered into this Agreement and that such amounts do
not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by Hawthorne or Parent. If either party fails to pay the other
party the amounts due under paragraphs (c) and (d) above within the time
periods specified therein, the party requested to make such payment shall
pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by the other party in connection with any action in which Parent
prevails, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of
such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts
at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts
were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
(other than Sections 6.06(c), 8.02 and, excepting Section 9.12 hereof, this
Article IX, which shall survive any such termination). Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations, warranties,

shareholder or former shareholder.



9.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this
Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision or (ii)
amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing  



 

42  among the parties hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement,
except that after the Hawthorne Meeting no amendment shall be made which by
law requires further approval by the stockholders of Hawthorne without
obtaining such approval.



9.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.



9.04 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in

and to be performed entirely within such State.



9.05 _Expenses_. Each party hereto will bear all expenses incurred by it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and
counsel, except that expenses of printing the Proxy Statement and the
registration fee to be paid to the SEC in connection with the Registration
Statement shall be shared equally between Hawthorne and Parent, and provided
further that nothing contained herein shall limit either partys rights to
recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other partys willful
breach of any provision of this Agreement.



9.06 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a
party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,

Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreements represent the entire
understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the
Transaction, and this Agreement, the Acquisition Sub Merger Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreements supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore
made. Except for the Indemnified Parties right to enforce Parents
obligation under Section 6.11, which are expressly intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party

9.08 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on Hawthorne or Parent, any term or
provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and
intents of this Agreement.



9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event
attorneys fees or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of
the obligations herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach
thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of
prosecution or defense, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred therein.



9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date hereof"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year
first above written (January 27, 2004). 



9.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.



9.12  _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
acquisition of Hawthorne set forth herein, subject to the prior written
consent of Hawthorne, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders
of Hawthorne Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount
as a result of such modification, (ii) such modification will not adversely
affect the tax treatment to Hawthornes stockholders as a result of receiving
the Merger Consideration and (iii) such modification will not materially delay
or jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities.

45 ANNEX A



HAWTHORNE SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT



HAWTHORNE SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of January 27,
2004, among  , a shareholder ("Shareholder") of Hawthorne
Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Hawthorne") and Commercial
Capital Bancorp, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Parent"). All terms used herein
and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger
Agreement (defined below).



 

WHEREAS, Parent, CCBI Acquisition Corp. ("Acquisition Sub") and Hawthorne are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof
(the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Hawthorne will merge with and into
Acquisition Sub on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger")
and, in connection therewith, outstanding shares of Hawthorne Common Stock
will be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in the manner set forth
therein; and



WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of Hawthorne Common Stock identified on
Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Hawthorne Common
Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement,
being referred to as the "Shares"); and



WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Shareholder, solely in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder
of Hawthorne and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and
perform this Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:



1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the
stockholders of Hawthorne, or in connection with any written consent of the
stockholders of Hawthorne, Shareholder shall:



(i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 



(ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written
consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the Shares (whether
acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder
or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or
direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of Hawthorne contained in the Merger Agreement or of
Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition
Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or
could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be
inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely
affect consummation of the Merger or this Agreement.



2\. _Transfer of Shares_.



(a) _Transferee of Shares to be Bound by this Agreement_. Shareholder hereby
agrees that prior to the Hawthorne Meeting, Shareholder shall not sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) unless each person
to which any of such Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for Shares) is so transferred has agreed in writing to hold
such Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Shares) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
perform all of the Shareholders obligations hereunder with respect to such
Shares.



(b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees Shareholder shall
not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into any
voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement in contravention of the
obligations of Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the
Shares.



 

A-1 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents
and warrants to and agrees with Parent as follows:



(a)  _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to
enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.



(b) _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles.



(c) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party
or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Shareholder.



4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will
be impossible to measure in money the damage to Parent if Shareholder fails
to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the
event of any such failure, Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law or
in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the
appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of
such relief on the basis that Parent may have an adequate remedy at law.
Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any
requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Parents
seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the
matter with Shareholder, Parent shall have the right to inform any third
party that Parent reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating,
participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in
violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights
of Parent hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with
Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with Parent
set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Parent against such
third party.



5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.



(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.



(b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date,
if any, of termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
or (ii) the date and time the Merger shall have become effective. Upon such
termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.



6\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions
hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by
any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of
any provision hereof by such party.



7\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered
personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by telecopy or
like transmission and on the next business day when sent by a reputable
overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses (or at

WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of Parent Common Stock identified on
Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of Parent Common
Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement,
being referred to as the "Shares"); and



 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Hawthorne to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Shareholder, solely in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of Parent
and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this
Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:



1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the
stockholders of Parent, or in connection with any written consent of the
stockholders of Parent, Shareholder shall:



(a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and



(b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written
consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the Shares (whether
acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder
or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or
direct the voting, (w) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; (x) in favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Parent contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder
contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition Proposal or
any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent
with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect
consummation of the Merger or this Agreement.



2\. _Transfer of Shares_.



(a) _Transferee of Shares to be Bound by this Agreement_. Shareholder hereby
agrees that prior to the Parent Meeting, Shareholder shall not sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) unless each person to which any of
such Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Shares) is so transferred has agreed in writing to hold such Shares (or
any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares)
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to perform all of
the Shareholders obligations hereunder with respect to such Shares.



 

B-1 (b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees Shareholder shall
not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into any
voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement in contravention of the
obligations of Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the
Shares.



3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents
and warrants to and agrees with Hawthorne as follows:



(a) _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter
into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.



(b) _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles.



(c) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute
a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or
any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a
party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to
which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other
organizational document of Shareholder.



4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will
be impossible to measure in money the damage to Hawthorne if Shareholder
fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in
the event of any such failure, Hawthorne will not have an adequate remedy at
law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the
appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of
such relief on the basis that Hawthorne may have an adequate remedy at
law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive
any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with
Hawthornes seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after
discussing the matter with Shareholder, Hawthorne shall have the right to
inform any third party that Hawthorne reasonably believes to be, or to be
contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder
assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and
of the rights of Hawthorne hereunder, and that participation by any such
persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholders agreement
with Hawthorne set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by
Hawthorne against such third party.



5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.



(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.



(b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date,
if any, of termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
or (ii) the date and time the Merger shall have become effective. Upon
such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.



6\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.



 

B-2 7\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered
personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by telecopy or

D-4 ANNEX E



 , 2004 



Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc.

 

One Venture, 3rd Floor

Irvine, California 92618



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that I may be deemed to be, but do not admit that I am, an
"affiliate" of Hawthorne Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Hawthorne"), as that term is defined in Rule 144 and used in Rule 145
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). I understand that
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January
27, 2004 (the "Agreement"), between Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc., a Nevada
corporation ("Parent"), CCBI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"), and Hawthorne,
Hawthorne plans to merge with and into Parent (the "Merger").



I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I will receive shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock")
in exchange for shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Hawthorne ("Hawthorne Common Stock").



I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Agreement and
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock, to the extent
I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Hawthorne.



I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event
I receive any shares of Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger:



I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such shares of
Parent Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has
been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), or (iii) in
the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, or under a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the
SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate the
registration requirements of, or is otherwise exempt from registration under,
the Securities Act.



I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock by me or
on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.



I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Parents transfer agent with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued
to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the
certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating
in substance:



"The shares represented by this certificate were issued as a result of the
merger of Hawthorne Financial Corporation with and into CCBI Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc., on
  , 2004, in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented by this certificate may
be transferred only in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement
between the registered holder hereof and Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc., a
copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of Commercial
Capital Bancorp, Inc.



 

E-1 I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Parent Common Stock issued to
me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities Act or
such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under
the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
place the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from [SHAREHOLDER] who, in turn,
received such shares as a result of the merger of Hawthorne Financial
Corporation with and into CCBI Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary
of Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. on , 2004, in a
transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The
shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred
except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933."



It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (3) and
(4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without
such legends if I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a "no action"
letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend
is not required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (ii) evidence or
representations satisfactory to Parent that Parent Common Stock represented by
such certificates is being or has been sold in conformity with the provisions
of Rule 145(d).



I further understand and agree that the provisions of Rule 145 shall apply to
all shares of Parent Common Stock that my spouse, any relative of mine, or any
relative of my spouse, any one of whom has the same home as me, receives as a
result of the Merger and I further represent, warrant and covenant with and
to Parent that I will have, and will cause each of such persons to have, all
shares of Hawthorne Common Stock owned (other than shares held through tax
qualified retirement or benefit plans) by me or such persons registered in my
name or the name of such persons, as applicable, prior to the effective date
of the Merger and not in the name of any bank, broker or dealer, nominee or
clearing house.



By acceptance hereof, Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the
Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement) that, so long as it is obligated
to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, it will use its reasonable best efforts to timely file
such reports so that the public information requirements of Rule 144(c)
promulgated under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions
of Rule 145(d)(1) and (2) are therefore available to me in the event I desire
to transfer any Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger.
