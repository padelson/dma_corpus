WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, Seller, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries
shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to consummate the
Reorganization Transactions, which Reorganization Transactions will provide
for, among other things, (i) the formation of a new corporate subsidiary of

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

  

  

1.01 Purchase and Sale of Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer designated in writing
by Buyer (any such Person, a "Buyer Designee"), and Buyer or such Buyer
Designee shall purchase and acquire from Seller, all of the Newco Shares owned
by Seller in exchange for the payment in cash by Buyer or such Buyer Designee
to Seller of the Closing Consideration. Payment for the Newco Shares shall be
made on the Closing Date in an amount equal to the Estimated Closing
Consideration (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.02(c)) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts specified by Seller
in the Closing Payment Certificate. Payments to Persons who are due amounts in
respect of the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Funded
Indebtedness shall be made by Buyer or Buyer Designee on the Closing Date by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts specified by Seller
in the Closing Payment Certificate. Except to the extent required by Law, all
sums payable by Buyer to Seller or any other Person under this Agreement shall
be paid free and clear of all Tax deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Buyer
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to Seller or any other Person such amount, if any, as is required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under Law;
provided, that, in the case of any such payment that does not constitute
compensation for services rendered, (a) at least five (5) calendar days prior
to making such payment, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of its obligation
to withhold, setting forth in reasonable detail its basis for such
withholding, and (b) Buyer shall in good faith take into account any
objections by Seller in determining whether such withholding is required.
Buyer or Buyer Designee, as applicable, will promptly pay or cause to be paid
any amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 1.01 for applicable Taxes (or
other amounts withheld) to the appropriate Governmental Body on behalf of
Seller or such other Person. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld
by Buyer or Buyer Designee, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller or such other Person,
as applicable, to the extent paid to the appropriate Governmental Body on
behalf of Seller or such other Person. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall
remain liable for the obligations of any Buyer Designee contained in this
Section 1.01.

  

  

1.02 Closing and Final Consideration.

  

  

(a) Closing Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "Closing
Consideration" means an amount equal to (i) $157,000,000 (the "Purchase
Price"), plus (ii) Cash on Hand as of the Closing Date, minus (iii)
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, plus (iv) the amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Target,
minus (v) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is
less than the Net Working Capital Target and minus (vi) the unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) Closing Payment Certificate. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate, duly executed by an
executive officer of Seller on behalf of Seller, accurately setting forth
Seller\'s good faith estimate of (i) the Net Working Capital as of the Closing
Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), (ii) the Cash on Hand as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Cash on Hand"), (iii) the Indebtedness as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (iv) the Funded
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Funded Indebtedness"), (v)
the unpaid Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Transaction Expenses") and (vi) the resulting Closing Consideration
(the "Estimated Closing Consideration"), together with a projected unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date (which shall be prepared in cooperation with the Chief Financial
Officer of Newco) and all other reasonable supporting documentation as well as
wire instructions for each Person entitled to receive any payment in respect
of the Estimated Closing Consideration, Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses
and Estimated Funded Indebtedness (such certificate and related deliverables,
collectively, the "Closing Payment Certificate").

  

  

(c) Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(i) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller (A) an unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of Newco and
the Sold Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (which shall have been prepared
in cooperation with the Chief Financial Officer of Newco) and (B) its
calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date, the Cash on
Hand as of the Closing Date, Indebtedness as of the Closing Date and the
Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date, and the resulting
recalculated Closing Consideration, in each case duly certified by Buyer as
accurately setting forth Buyer\'s good faith determination of the information
set forth therein, and together, in each case, with all reasonable supporting
documentation (together, the "Closing Statement"). The Closing Statement shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the definition of the terms "Net
Working Capital", "Cash on Hand", "Indebtedness", "Company Transaction
Expenses" and "Closing Consideration" set forth in this Agreement, and "Net
Working Capital" shall be prepared in a manner consistent with GAAP, and in a
manner consistent with, and using the same principles, policies, methods and
practices (including as to reserves and accruals) used in, the preparation of
the Financial Statements to the extent such principles, policies, methods and
practices are consistent with GAAP. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
calculation of the Net Working Capital shall entirely disregard (x) any and
all effects on the assets or liabilities of Newco, the Company and the Sold
Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any purchase accounting adjustments) or any of the financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other transaction
entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (y) any of the plans, transactions or changes which
Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries or the
Businesses or their assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or
particular to Buyer or any of its assets or liabilities (other than those
facts or circumstances, as the case may be, that are unique or particular to
the assets or liabilities acquired directly or indirectly pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(ii) Buyer, Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries shall grant Seller
and its authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries, to
the offices, properties, books and records of Newco, the Company and the Sold
Subsidiaries as it or its representatives may reasonably request for purposes
of reviewing the Closing Statement, and Seller shall have up to sixty (60)
calendar days after receiving the Closing Statement to review the Closing
Statement (the "Review Period"); provided, however, that, in the event Buyer,
Newco, the Company or any of the Sold Subsidiaries does not provide copies of
any papers or documents used by Buyer in preparing the Closing Statement or
used by Newco in preparing the Closing Payment Certificate or access to
personnel of Buyer or its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Seller or any
of its representatives within five (5) Business Days after request therefor
(or such shorter period as may remain in the Review Period), the Review Period
shall be extended by five (5) Business Days plus one (1) Business Day for each
additional day required for Buyer, Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries
to fully respond to such request.

  

  

(iii) If Buyer fails to deliver to Seller the Closing Statement within the one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Cash on Hand, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Closing Consideration
as indicated by Seller pursuant to Section 1.02(b) shall be deemed to be the
final, binding and non-appealable determination of the final Working Capital,
the final Cash on Hand, the final Closing Indebtedness, the final Company
Transaction Expenses and the Final Closing Consideration by the parties
hereto. If Seller confirms its acceptance of the Closing Statement within the
Review Period or has not objected in writing to the calculation of the Net
Working Capital, the Cash on Hand, Indebtedness, the Company Transaction
Expenses or the resulting recalculated Closing Consideration set forth on the
Closing Statement by the end of the Review Period, the Closing Statement and
the calculation of the Net Working Capital, the Cash on Hand, Indebtedness,
the Company Transaction Expenses or resulting recalculated Closing
Consideration thereon as prepared by Buyer shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) If Seller has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement (an "Objections Statement") setting forth those
items to which Seller objects (the "Disputed Items"), Seller\'s proposed
alternative calculation for each such Disputed Item and Seller\'s proposed
recalculated Closing Consideration. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Items, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) calendar days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP; provided, however, that, if
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity,
Seller and Buyer shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to an alternative
mutually agreed upon independent accounting or valuation firm of national
reputation (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such alternative firm, the "Firm").
Each party may furnish to the Firm such information and documents as it deems
relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other party. The Firm shall
resolve each unresolved Disputed Item based solely on the calculation
methodology and definitions set forth in this Agreement and upon supporting
material provided by Buyer and Seller and not pursuant to any independent
review and may not assign a value to any particular unresolved Disputed Item
greater than the greatest value for such unresolved Disputed Item claimed by
either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
party, in each case as presented to the Firm. Seller and Buyer shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to request that the Firm resolve
such unresolved Disputed Items and notify them in writing of such resolution
as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) calendar days
after the date on which the Firm is first retained. The decision of the Firm
regarding each of the unresolved Disputed Items and the resulting Final
Closing Consideration shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the
parties hereto. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection
with the resolution of such unresolved Disputed Items by the Firm. The fees
and expenses of the Firm shall be borne on a proportionate basis by Buyer and
Seller based on the inverse proportion of the respective percentages of the
dollar value of unresolved Disputed Items determined in favor of Buyer and
Seller, respectively. Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause Newco and
the Sold Subsidiaries to, cooperate reasonably with the Firm and respond on a
timely basis to all reasonable requests for information or access to documents
or personnel made by the Firm, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith
resolve all unresolved Disputed Items as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Once all Disputed Items are resolved, the calculation of the Net Working
Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses and
resulting recalculated Closing Consideration on the Closing Statement shall be
adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect (a) any resolution of Disputed Items as
agreed between Buyer and Seller or (b) any determination of Disputed Items by
the Firm, and the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Net Working
Capital, Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses and resulting recalculated
Closing Consideration thereon (in each case, as so adjusted) shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(v) If the Closing Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.02(c) (the "Final Closing Consideration") is greater than the
Estimated Closing Consideration then, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Closing Consideration, Buyer shall pay to Seller,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Final
Closing Consideration less the Estimated Closing Consideration.

  

  

(vi) If the Final Closing Consideration is less than the Estimated Closing
Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
the Final Closing Consideration, Seller shall pay to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Estimated Closing
Consideration less the Final Closing Consideration.

  

  

(vii) If the Final Closing Consideration is equal to the Estimated Closing
Consideration, then neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to make any
payment to the other pursuant to this Section 1.02(c).

  

  

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.02(c) or
otherwise, in the event that the absolute value of the difference between Net
Working Capital as recalculated pursuant to this Section 1.02 and Estimated
Net Working Capital is less than $50,000, then the amount of the Estimated Net
Working Capital shall be deemed to be the final recalculated Net Working
Capital for purposes of determining the Final Closing Consideration.

  

  

(ix) All payments required pursuant to this Section 1.02(c) shall be deemed to
be adjustments, for Tax purposes, to the aggregate purchase price paid by
Buyer for the Newco Shares purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

(d) Post-Closing Medical Liabilities Adjustment. Within sixty (60) calendar
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a reasonably
detailed calculation of Liabilities of the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries
for medical claims incurred, but not reported, as of the Closing Date
(collectively, "Medical Liabilities"), calculated in a manner consistent with
Seller\'s historical actuarial practices for such Medical Liabilities. If
Seller has any objections to such calculation, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
within sixty (60) calendar days a statement setting forth those items to which
Seller objects, Seller\'s proposed alternative calculation for each such
disputed item and Seller\'s proposed recalculation of Medical Liabilities.
Thereafter, the dispute resolution mechanism of Section 1.02(c)(iv) shall
apply mutatis mutandis and, once all such disputed items are so resolved, if
the amount of Medical Liabilities as finally determined exceeds $175,000 then,
within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, Seller shall pay
to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
such excess.

  

  

1.03 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of KandL Gates LLP,
134 Meeting Street, Suite 200, Charleston, South Carolina 29401, on the third
Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions
set forth in Article 2 hereof (other than those to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions), or
on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller; provided,
that in no event shall the date of the Closing occur prior to day that is
thirty (30) days from the date hereof. The date of the Closing is herein
referred to as the "Closing Date." The Closing shall be deemed to occur at,
and the calculation of all amounts in respect of the Closing Consideration
shall be made as of, 12:01 a.m. prevailing Eastern time on the Closing Date.

with its terms.

hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under the HSR
Act, any other applicable foreign competition or antitrust Laws and other Laws
applicable to Seller and its Affiliates for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Buyer shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable shall have the right to consult with Seller on, all
the information that appears in any such filings (and Seller shall consider in
good faith the views of Buyer in connection therewith). In exercising the
foregoing right, Buyer shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
HandH Group and Seller shall coordinate and cooperate with Buyer in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as Buyer may reasonably request
in connection with the foregoing.

  

  

(b) In the event of any requests for information made by any Governmental
Body, including requests for production of documents and production of
witnesses for interviews or depositions, HandH Group and Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to limit the scope of such requests and otherwise
respond to and seek to resolve any such requests. Without limiting the
foregoing, HandH Group and Seller shall certify substantial compliance with any
and all such requests (such certification, the "Seller Certification") within
one hundred fifteen (115) calendar days following the date of this Agreement
(such date, the "Seller Certification Date"), unless both Seller and Buyer
agree in writing and subject to Section 8.01(d). In addition, HandH Group and
Seller shall cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Bodies in carrying
out their respective obligations under this Section 6.03.

  

  

(c) HandH Group and Seller shall keep Buyer apprised of the status of all
filings and submissions referred to in Section 6.03(a) above, including
promptly furnishing Buyer with copies of notices or other communications
received by HandH Group and Seller in connection therewith and, subject to
applicable Law, permitting Buyer to review in advance any proposed oral or
written communication by Seller or its Affiliates in connection therewith (and
considering in good faith the views of Buyer in connection therewith). Seller
shall not permit any of its Affiliates, officers, employees or other
representatives or agents to participate in any meeting or telephonic
conference with any Governmental Body in respect of such filings and
submissions unless it consults with Buyer in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Body, gives Buyer the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. HandH Group and Seller shall coordinate and cooperate with
Buyer in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as Buyer
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

(d) In the event that any Governmental Order is entered or issued, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any Action, investigation
or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof unlawful,
or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of such transactions, HandH Group and Seller shall use, and shall
cause the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best
efforts to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or
remove such actual, anticipated or Threatened Governmental Order so as to
permit such consummation on a schedule as close as reasonably practicable to
that contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.03(d) shall be construed to require
HandH Group to contest any lawsuit, court action or other court proceeding
commenced by any Governmental Body, or institute any lawsuit, court action or
other court proceeding against any Governmental Body, in either case to the
extent HandH Group has determined in good faith that the costs, expenses and
other obligations associated with any such lawsuit, court action or other
court proceeding, when considered in the context of the likelihood of such
lawsuit, court action or other court proceeding being successfully concluded
on or prior to the Outside Date (including as the same may be extended
pursuant to Section 8.01(d)), imposes an unreasonable burden on HandH Group.

  

  

(e) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, HandH Group and Seller shall
(i) promptly deliver to Buyer copies of any correspondence with or notice from
the PBGC and (ii) cooperate with all requests and inquiries of the PBGC to the
extent related to the Company, the Sold Subsidiaries, Seller, or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

representatives to, cooperate fully to that end, so as to, as promptly as
practicable, consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, HandH Group and Seller shall,
and shall cause Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries to, (A) use

control) to cause the conditions set forth in Sections 2.01(a), (b), (c), (d),
(f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l) and Section 2.02(i)(A) hereof to be
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as

Closing), and (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents,
waivers, confirmations, novations and approvals of third parties that HandH
Group, Seller, Newco, the Company or any Sold Subsidiary is required to obtain

waivers, confirmations, novations and approvals, as applicable, in full force
and effect once obtained. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall limit, expand or otherwise modify

shall disclose to Buyer in writing any variances or inaccuracies from the

supplement the applicable Disclosure Schedule(s) for purposes of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 2.01(a) or Buyer\'s ability to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b) nor shall they be deemed
to cure any misrepresentation or breach that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such variance, inaccuracy or breach, and Buyer\'s right
to make a claim (whether for indemnification or otherwise) against Seller or
HandH Group for any such variance, inaccuracy or breach shall in no way be
restricted or limited by any such disclosure.

  

  

6.06 Sensitive Information. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this
Agreement to the contrary, HandH Group, Seller and its Subsidiaries may withhold
from Buyer (a) any document or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party or (b) such portions of documents
or information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive
if the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, in the
reasonable judgment of HandH Group based on the advice of its outside counsel,
is necessary under applicable Law, including any competition or antitrust Law;
provided, however, that HandH Group will promptly notify Buyer if any
information is withheld pursuant to this Section 6.06(b) and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) deliver such information in an
alternative format, (ii) to deliver such information to Buyer\'s outside
counsel and marked "outside counsel only" (in which case Buyer shall direct
its outside counsel to not to disclose such information to Buyer\'s employees,
officers or directors without the prior written consent of HandH Group), or

necessary to avoid violation of any such Law.

  

  

6.07 Financial Statements Cooperation. From and after the date hereof
(including after the Closing Date), to the extent reasonably requested by
Buyer, HandH Group and its Affiliates shall reasonably and timely cooperate with

the date hereof, which shall be in substantially the same form as previously
provided to HandH Group), the historical and pro forma financial statements of
Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries as of and for periods prior to the Closing

Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Such cooperation shall include providing
reasonable audit support and documentation, reasonable access to employees of
HandH Group and its Affiliates and coordination with outside parties, including
but not limited to legal counsel and insurance broker; provided, however,
that, (a) the cooperation of HandH Group and its Affiliates shall be provided
during regular business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of HandH Group or its Affiliates and shall be at the sole
cost and expense of Buyer (and any fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith shall not be Seller Transaction Expenses and shall be promptly
reimbursed by Buyer, including in the event of termination of this Agreement
by either Buyer or HandH Group as provided in Section 8.01) and (b) HandH Group
and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to retain or engage any third

(b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8 (such

not, and shall cause Handy and Harman Ltd., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
and each of Parent\'s other consolidated Subsidiaries other than HandH Group
(together with Parent and HandH Group, the "Restricted Parties") to not,
directly or indirectly, in any manner (whether on his, her or its own account,
or as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director, employee,
investor, agent or otherwise), anywhere in any jurisdiction where Newco, the
Company or any Sold Subsidiary conducts its Businesses as of the date hereof
or as of the Closing Date, engage directly or indirectly in the Businesses or

representative or otherwise), render services for or consult with any Person

similar blind-pool investment vehicle (other than a fund or investment vehicle

6.12 Covenant Not to Solicit. From the Closing Date until the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, each Restricted Party shall not, directly or
indirectly, in any manner (whether on its own account, as an owner, operator,
manager, consultant, officer, director, employee, investor, agent or
otherwise), (a) hire or engage or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to
employ or engage or enter into any business relationship with any executive
officer or manager employed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries), or induce
or attempt to induce any Person to leave such employment, (b) in any way
tortiously interfere with the relationship between Buyer or its Subsidiaries
and any employee, customer, sales representative, broker, supplier, licensee
or other business relation (or any prospective customer, supplier, licensee or
other business relationship) of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including by making
any negative or disparaging statements or communications regarding Buyer and
its Subsidiaries or any of their operations, officers, directors or investors)
or (c) recommend, or provide any reference to a third party for, any employee
of Newco, the Company or any of the Sold Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit (x) general advertisements

broad-based hiring methods not specifically targeted to any particular
employee or group of employees, unless such advertisement, solicitation or
other hiring method is undertaken as a means to circumvent the restrictions

Person who responds to such advertisement, solicitation or other hiring method
(y) soliciting for hire, hiring, recommending or providing any reference to a
third party for any Person who at such time is no longer an employee of Buyer
or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

6.13 Confidentiality. HandH Group acknowledges that the success of the
Businesses after the Closing depends upon the continued preservation of the
confidentiality of certain information possessed by HandH Group, that the
preservation of the confidentiality of such information by Seller is an
essential premise of the bargain between HandH Group and Buyer, and that Buyer
would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this Section
6.13. Accordingly, HandH Group hereby agrees that, for a period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the date that is two (2) years following the
date of the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof, HandH Group shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, disclose to any Person other than its Subsidiaries, or use
in a manner that would result in a breach of any of HandH Group\'s covenants
hereunder, any Confidential Information. For purposes of this Section 6.13,
"Confidential Information" means any information that is treated as
confidential or proprietary by Newco, the Company or any of the Sold
Subsidiaries, including their respective trade secrets, customer lists and
pricing information; provided, however, that "Confidential Information" shall
not include any information generally available to, or known by, the public
(other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof), or obtained from a
source on a non-confidential basis after the Closing (other than Newco, the
Company, the Sold Subsidiaries or any Business Employees). Further, the
provisions of this Section 6.13 will not prohibit any retention of copies of
records or disclosure (a) required by any applicable Law (other than federal
and state securities Laws) so long as reasonable prior notice is given to
Buyer and Newco of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to
Buyer and Newco to contest the same, (b) required by any federal or state
securities Laws, (c) or use of information delivered or made available
pursuant to Sections 7.05 and 9.12 or otherwise contemplated or permitted
under this Agreement (but solely to the extent such use is reasonably related
to the purposes pursuant to which access to or delivery of such information is
granted under any such applicable provision of this Agreement), or (d) made in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the defense of such
enforcement by any other party. It is acknowledged and agreed that HandH Group
and its Subsidiaries have been involved in businesses that are similar to the
Businesses and that such involvement has inevitably enhanced their knowledge
and understanding of the industry in which Newco, the Company and the Sold
Subsidiaries operate in a way that cannot be separated from other knowledge,
and, accordingly, this Section 6.13 shall not preclude, prohibit or restrict
HandH Group and its Subsidiaries from using such general knowledge and
understanding of Newco\'s, the Company\'s and the Sold Subsidiaries\' industry
so long as HandH Group and its Subsidiaries do not disclose any Confidential
Information.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

  

 

  

6.14 Labor Relations Matters. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, HandH
Group shall, and shall cause Seller, Newco, the Company and the Sold
Subsidiaries to, coordinate in advance with Buyer in connection with any
communications about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any
employees or labor unions of Newco, the Company or any of the Sold
Subsidiaries and will provide Buyer the reasonable opportunity to send
representatives to attend any meetings with employees or labor unions
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

6.15 Financial Resources. From and after the Closing Date, HandH Group shall
keep available sufficient financial resources to satisfy its indemnity
obligations hereunder.

  

  

6.16 Termination of Inter-Company Liabilities. Prior to the Closing HandH Group
shall cause the termination of all Liabilities existing between HandH Group and
its Affiliates (other than Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and Newco, the Company or any Sold Subsidiary, on the other
hand, and such termination, in and of itself, will create no Liability to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates from and after the Closing.

  

  

6.17 Change of Name of Arlon India. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, HandH Group shall take such actions as are necessary
to change the name of Arlon India to a name that does not include the word
"Arlon" or any confusingly similar name or derivative thereof.

not be deemed to cure any misrepresentation or breach that might have existed

purposes of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 2.02(a) or HandH
Group\'s ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c), and

7.02 Regulatory Filings.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall, within six (6) Business Days after the date hereof, make or
cause to be made all filings and submissions under the HSR Act, any other
applicable foreign competition or antitrust Laws and other Laws applicable to

herein. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
HandH Group shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable shall have the right to consult with Buyer on, all the information
that appears in any such filings (and Buyer shall consider in good faith the

and providing such assistance as HandH Group may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing.

  

  

(b) In the event of any requests for information made by any Governmental
Body, including requests for production of documents and production of
witnesses for interviews or depositions, Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to limit the scope of such requests and otherwise respond to and seek
to resolve any such requests. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall
certify substantial compliance with any and all such additional requests (such
certification, the "Buyer Certification") within one hundred fifteen (115)
calendar days following the date of this Agreement (such date, the "Buyer
Certification Date"), unless both Buyer and HandH Group agree in writing and
subject to Section 8.01(d). In addition, Buyer shall cooperate in good faith
with the Governmental Bodies in carrying out its obligations under this
Section 7.02; provided, however, that in no event shall Buyer be obligated to
sell, transfer or otherwise divest any of its or any of its Subsidiaries\'
assets, properties or businesses (including assets, properties or businesses
which were assets, properties or businesses of HandH Group, Seller, the Company,
Newco or any Sold Subsidiary prior to the Closing) or enter into any
agreements providing for any such sale, transfer or other divestiture or
restricting or limiting in any way or to any extent Newco, the Company or the
Sold Subsidiaries from engaging in any business anywhere in the world. Buyer
shall be responsible for all filing fees under the HSR Act, under any other
applicable foreign competition or antitrust Laws and under any such other Laws
applicable to Buyer.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall keep HandH Group apprised of the status of all filings and
submissions referred to in Section 7.02(a) above, including promptly
furnishing HandH Group with copies of notices or other communications received
by Buyer in connection therewith and, subject to applicable Law, permitting
HandH Group to review in advance any proposed oral or written communication by
Buyer or its Affiliates in connection therewith (and considering in good faith
the views of HandH Group in connection therewith). Buyer shall not permit any of
its Affiliates, officers, employees or other representatives or agents to
participate in any meeting or telephonic conference with any Governmental Body
in respect of such filings and submissions unless it consults with HandH Group
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives HandH
Group the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(d) Subject to the proviso in the second sentence of Section 7.02(b), in the
event that any Governmental Order is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any Action, investigation or inquiry
of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof unlawful, or that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual,
anticipated or Threatened Governmental Order so as to permit such consummation
on a schedule as close as reasonably practicable to that contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 7.02(d) shall be construed to require Buyer to contest any
lawsuit, court action or other court proceeding instituted by any Governmental
Body, or institute any lawsuit, court action or other court proceeding against
any Governmental Body, in either case to the extent Buyer has determined in
good faith that the costs, expenses and other obligations associated with any
such lawsuit, court action or court proceeding, when considered in the context
of the likelihood of such lawsuit, court action or court proceeding being
successfully concluded on or prior to the Outside Date (including as the same
may be extended pursuant to Section 8.01(d)), imposes an unreasonable burden
on Buyer.

  

  

7.03 Conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, from the
date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, agree
to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, any and all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable
Law or otherwise, and cause its Affiliates representatives to, cooperate fully
to that end, so as to, as promptly as practicable, consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (to
the extent reasonably in Buyer\'s control) the conditions set forth in Section
2.02(a), (b), (d), (g), (h) and (i) hereof to be satisfied and to consummate
the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably practicable after
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.02 (other than those

with HandH Group, Seller, the Company, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries in their
effort to obtain all consents, waivers, confirmations, novations and approvals

foregoing is bound in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and, once the same are obtained, cooperate reasonably with HandH Group, Seller,
the Company, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries in maintaining in full force and
effect such consents, waivers, confirmations, novations and approvals, as
applicable, and (C) use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing, Buyer\'s Title Policy; provided, however, in no event shall Buyer\'s
obligations under this clause (C) obligate Buyer to indemnify any title
insurance company or its agents, or any escrow, closing or settlement company
or agent or closing attorney in any so-called owner\'s affidavit or ALTA
statement or in connection with any representations or statements set forth
therein. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in

Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby only with the prior written consent of HandH Group (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit Buyer and its representatives
from contacting the customers, suppliers and other material business relations
of HandH Group, Seller, Company, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of Buyer\'s business and not related to HandH Group, Seller, the Company,
Newco, the Sold Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

7.05 Access. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause Newco, the Company
and the Sold Subsidiaries to provide HandH Group and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours upon reasonable notice and in a manner
so as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal business operations of
Buyer, Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries to the personnel, books
and records of Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date in connection with (a) the
preparation of Tax Returns, or (b) compliance, financial reporting (including
financial audits of historical information) and accounting matters and (c) any
indemnity claim pursuant to the indemnification provisions hereunder;
provided, that nothing in this Section 7.05 shall obligate Buyer to disclose
any information if the disclosure of such information would (i) reasonably be
expected to cause such information to lose the protections of attorney-client
privilege arising after the Closing or (ii) violate any confidentiality
obligations arising prior to the Closing between Buyer, Newco, the Company or
any Sold Subsidiary and an unaffiliated third party (provided, that Buyer
shall, without being required to pay any out-of-pocket costs or expenses other
than those dictated by the applicable agreement pursuant to which such
confidentiality obligations arise, use its reasonable efforts to obtain
waivers and consents necessary or appropriate to provide such information as
is reasonably requested by Seller). Without limiting the foregoing, within ten
(10) Business Days after the Closing, Buyer shall provide HandH Group with a
final, year-to-date trial balance for Newco, the Company and the Sold
Subsidiaries through the Closing Date, which trial balance shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements and the Company\'s
historical practices. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by HandH Group,
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company, Newco or any of its
Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books and records of the Company,
Newco or its Subsidiaries, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior
to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to HandH Group
and offering to surrender to HandH Group such books and records or such portions
thereof. The provisions of this Section 7.05 shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Buyer, Newco, the Company and their Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, as the case may be.

  

  

7.06 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall ensure that Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries do not, amend,
repeal or modify any provision in Newco\'s, the Company\'s or the Sold
Subsidiaries\' certificate of incorporation or bylaws relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any officers and
directors in any way that diminishes or adversely affects the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provided therein as it applies to
any Persons serving in such capacity prior to the Closing Date (unless
required by law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers and
directors of Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries who were officers
and directors prior to the Closing (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") shall
continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses to the full extent provided for under Newco\'s, the Company\'s and
the Sold Subsidiaries\' certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
applicable organizational documents as of immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 7.06 and not
in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall
cause Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries (each, a "DandO Indemnifying
Party") to, to the fullest extent permitted under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other applicable organizational documents, (i)
indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to Buyer, Newco,
the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries) the DandO Indemnified Persons against all
DandO Expenses (as defined below), losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts
paid in settlement (collectively, "DandO Costs") in respect of any Threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal,
civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising out or relating to
the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of Newco, the
Company or the Sold Subsidiaries and arising out of acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Closing (including in respect of acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby) (a "DandO Indemnifiable Claim") and (ii) advance to such DandO
Indemnified Persons all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of
reasonably detailed statements therefor; provided, however, that the DandO
Indemnified Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
DandO Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any DandO
Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of
this Section 7.06(b), "DandO Expenses" means attorneys\' fees and all other
costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in any DandO Indemnifiable
Claim, in each case solely to the extent such amounts would be subject to
indemnification, reimbursement or advancement under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other applicable organizational documents, but shall
exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement
(which items are, for the avoidance of doubt, included in the definition of
DandO Costs).

  

  

(c) In the event Buyer, Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer,
Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06. The provisions of this Section
7.06 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer, Newco, the
Company and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as the case may be, and are
expressly intended to benefit each of the DandO Indemnified Persons.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

  

 

  

7.07 Employment and Benefit Arrangements.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that all
employees of Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries shall receive
service credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals
(solely, in the case of benefit accruals for purposes of determining vacation
and severance) with respect to all periods of service with Seller, the
Company, Newco, the Sold Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors prior to
the Closing Date for all purposes under any comparable employee benefit or
compensation plans, contracts, programs, policies arrangements and agreements
established or maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries) (the "Buyer Benefit
Plans"); provided, however, that no such service recognition shall result in
any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall take all necessary actions (i) to waive or cause to be waived
any waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements
for employees (and, where applicable, the dependents and beneficiaries of the
employees) of Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries under all Buyer
Benefit Plans that are self-insured medical plans and (ii) to give or grant
such employees (and, where applicable, the dependents and beneficiaries of the
employees) credit under all Buyer Benefit Plans that are self-insured medical
plans (for purposes of annual deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
limits for any covered claims incurred or payments made that have been paid or
incurred by the employees or their dependents made prior to the Closing Date
during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, in each case, to the
extent all information reasonably necessary to implement such actions has been
received from HandH Group.

  

  

(c) Upon reasonable request, HandH Group shall provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall
provide to HandH Group, such documents, data and information as may reasonably
be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 7.07 and to
administer their respective benefit plans.

  

  

(d) Effective as of the Closing, Newco, the Company and each of the Sold
Subsidiaries shall withdraw from participation in all Benefit Plans other than
Transferred Company Benefit Plans, and, except as provided in this Section
7.07, Buyer and its Affiliates (including Newco, the Company and the Sold
Subsidiaries), shall become responsible for any Transferred Company Benefit
Plans. From and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including Newco,
the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries) shall have no Liability relating to any
Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans other than the Transferred
Company Benefit Plans, and HandH Group and its Affiliates shall indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to any and all such
Liabilities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(e) As of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause each individual employed in the
United States by any Sold Subsidiary or United States expatriate employed
outside of the United States by any Sold Subsidiary (each, a "Subject
Employee") to be fully vested in his or her account balance in, and accrued
benefit under, the Bairnco Corporation 401(k) Plan and Trust ("Seller\'s 401(k)
Plan"). Each Subject Employee shall be entitled to distribution of his or her
account balance or accrued benefit as authorized by, and subject to the
limitations of, Seller\'s 401(k) Plan and applicable Law. Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate to facilitate the direct rollover of distributions
due Buyer New Employees from Seller\'s 401(k) Plan, where elected by a Buyer
New Employee within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, in the form of cash
or the distributee\'s promissory note, and Seller shall take, or cause to be
taken, any action reasonably required to avoid any default of a Buyer New
Employee\'s loan from Seller\'s 401(k) Plan pending completion of such direct
rollover

  

  

(f) Nothing in Section 7.07, expressed or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
of the employees of HandH Group, Seller, Buyer, the Company, Newco or any of
their respective Affiliates or representatives, any rights or remedies,
including any right to benefits or employment, or continued benefits or
employment, for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever by
reason of this Agreement, (ii) be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program or contract or (iii) prohibit Buyer from, or any in any
manner limit Buyer\'s right to, terminate the employment of any specific
employee, terminate or modify any employee benefit plan or dispose of all or
any portion of the Businesses.

  

  

7.08 Other Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees (as defined below) from and
against any Losses (as defined below) that may be incurred by them (i) under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (or any similar
state or local Law with respect to plant closing, layoff or relocation)
arising at or after the Closing as a result of any action or omission of
Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries occurring at or after the Closing
or (ii) with respect to any obligation to provide notice, payment or any other
benefit as a result of or arising out of any termination of employment of any
employee of Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries at or after the
Closing.

  

  

(b) Effective as of and following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Newco,
the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries, as applicable, to continue to honor all
of their respective obligations and liabilities under the Collective
Bargaining Agreements identified on Schedule 4.10.

  

  

7.09 Signing Date Representations Letter. Promptly, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
deliver to HandH Group an executed copy of the Signing Date Representations
Letter deliverable to the insurance carrier underwriting the RandW Policy (the
"Signing Date Representations Letter").

  

  

7.10 Canadian Plans. With respect to the \'548 Plan, Buyer hereby agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will amend, supplement or withdraw any
of the paperwork submitted to the Canadian Revenue Agency and Financial
Services Commission or otherwise take any action that would reasonably be
expected to impede the transfer of the \'548 Plan from the Company to
Atlantic. With respect to the \'160 Plan, Buyer hereby agrees that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries will amend, supplement or withdraw any of the
paperwork submitted to the Canadian Revenue Agency and Financial Services
Commission or otherwise take any action that would reasonably be expected to
impede the wind-down of the \'160 Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, from
and after the Closing neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall contact or
otherwise communicate with the Canadian Revenue Agency and Financial Services
Commission with respect to the \'160 Plan or the \'548 Plan without the
consent of HandH Group (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), or otherwise take any action with respect to the
\'160 Plan or the \'548 Plan.

8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and HandH Group;

  

  

(b) by Buyer, if Buyer is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause
the condition to the Closing set forth in Section 2.02(b) from being satisfied
as of the Closing Date and if there has been one or more material violations
or breaches by HandH Group or Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement which has prevented or would reasonably be
expected to prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
Buyer at the Closing; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision
of this Section 8.01(b), in the event all such violations and breaches are
curable by HandH Group or Seller, then upon notice by HandH Group to Buyer,
delivered not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to HandH Group of
a written notice from Buyer of such violation(s) or breach(es), that it
intends to cure all such violations and breaches, then Buyer shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) unless
all such violations and breaches have not been cured by the Outside Date;

  

  

(c) by HandH Group, if HandH Group and Seller are not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause the condition to the Closing set forth in Section
2.01(b) from being satisfied as of the Closing Date and if there has been one
or more material violations or breaches by Buyer of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has prevented or
would reasonably be expected to prevent the satisfaction of any condition to
the obligations of HandH Group and Seller at the Closing; provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this Section 8.01(c), in the event
all such violations and breaches are curable by Buyer, then upon notice by
Buyer, delivered not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to Buyer
of a written notice from HandH Group of such violation(s) or breach(es), that it
intends to cure all such violations and breaches, then Seller shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) unless
all such violations and breaches have not been cured by the Outside Date; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(d) by either HandH Group or Buyer, upon written notice to the other, if the
transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated on or prior to May
18, 2015 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that if on the Outside Date
all conditions set forth in Sections 2.01 and 2.02 (other than those set forth
in Sections 2.01(e) and 2.02(e) and those that are to be satisfied by actions
to be taken at the Closing) are satisfied or waived, except that if either
Buyer has failed to timely comply with its obligations under the second
sentence of Section 7.02(b) or HandH Group has failed to timely comply with its
obligations under the second sentence of Section 6.03(b), then any party that
has failed to so timely comply shall have no right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) until the earlier of (i) the date that is
thirty-five (35) calendar days after the date on which such party has complied
with such applicable obligation or (ii) the date that is seven (7) months
following the date of this Agreement; provided, further, however, that neither
HandH Group nor Buyer shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.01(d) if such party\'s (or, in the case of HandH Group,
Seller\'s) breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Buyer or HandH Group as provided above, the provisions of this Agreement
shall immediately become void and of no further force or effect, and there
shall be no Liability on the part of any of Buyer, HandH Group or Seller to one
another; provided, however, that (i) no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability for damages to any other party hereto resulting
from any willful breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement and (ii)
the last sentence of Section 6.02, this Section 8.02 and Article 11 hereof
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms
and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms (and, notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary,
the Confidentiality Agreement term shall automatically be amended to be
extended for an additional two (2) year period commencing on the date on which
the Confidentiality Agreement would have otherwise terminated in accordance
with its terms as the Confidentiality Agreement is in effect as of the date
hereof).

  

  

ARTICLE 9

(18) months following the Closing Date (the "General Expiration Date") and
shall then expire and be of no force or effect, and the Fundamental
Representations and the indemnity contained in Section 9.12(l) shall survive
the Closing until the date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations and shall then expire and be of no force

9.02 Indemnification of Buyer.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article
9), Buyer and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents (the
"Buyer Indemnitees") shall be indemnified by HandH Group in respect of any loss,
Liability, damage, deficiency, demand, judgment, interest, fine, Tax, penalty,
assessment, Action, award, cost or expense (including reasonable out-of-pocket
costs of investigation and defense and attorneys\' and other professionals\'
fees) (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") suffered
or incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees to the extent such Loss results from, is
caused by or arises out of (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller or HandH Group contained in Article 3 or 4 of this Agreement and any
certificate delivered hereunder by or on behalf of Seller, HandH Group, Newco,
the Company or any of the Sold Subsidiaries other than a Fundamental
Representation, (ii) a breach of any Fundamental Representation of Seller or
HandH Group contained in Article 3 or 4 of this Agreement, (iii) a breach of or
non-compliance with any covenant or agreement by Seller or HandH Group contained
in this Agreement, (iv) (A) any Liabilities with respect to the Excluded
Subsidiaries and the Old Company and (B) any Liabilities with respect to
Seller, other than to the extent resulting from, caused by or arising out of
Seller\'s ownership or operation of, or otherwise attributable to, Newco, the
Company or any of the Sold Subsidiaries, (v) any Liability of Newco, the
Company or the Sold Subsidiaries related to the Omega Chemical Corporation
Superfund Site (the "Omega Superfund Site") in Whittier, California, EPA ID#:
CAD042245001 ("Omega Site Liability") and (vi) any matter set forth on
Schedule 9.02(a).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) Even if a Buyer Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
for a Loss pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to indemnification for a Loss pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) unless a
claim or series of related claims individually involves such Losses in excess
of $25,000;

  

  

(ii) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for any
Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) except to the extent the aggregate
amount of all such Losses exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the Purchase Price (such amount, the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible;

  

  

(iii) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for any
Losses pursuant to Sections 9.02(a)(i) or 9.02(a)(ii) to the extent the
aggregate amount of all such Losses paid or payable to the Buyer Indemnitees
by or on behalf of HandH Group exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the Purchase Price (the "General
Cap"); provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision of
this Section 9.02(b)(iii),

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(A) with respect to Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) to the extent
arising out of (1) Sections 4.15(c) or 4.15(d) (Compliance with Laws) or
Section 4.16 (Environmental Matters), (2) any of the exclusions under the RandW
Policy that are listed on Schedule 9.02(b)(iii) (the "Specified Exclusions")
or (3) those matters (if any) identified on the Closing Date Representations
Letter that were not identified on the Signing Date Representations Letter
(the "Interim Period Matters"), the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses does not
exceed on a cumulative basis, together with all other Losses pursuant to which
the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification under Section 9.02(a)
and Section 9.12(l), an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase
Price;

  

  

(B) with respect to Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(ii) and attributable to
one or more of the Specified Exclusions or the Interim Period Matters (such
Losses collectively, the "Carved-Out Fundamental Losses"), the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent the aggregate
amount of all such Losses does not exceed on a cumulative basis, together with
all other Losses pursuant to which the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.02(a) and Section 9.12(l), an amount equal to
the Purchase Price; and

  

  

(C) with respect to Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(ii) other than the
Carved-Out Fundamental Losses, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification in excess of the General Cap only to the extent the aggregate
amount of all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to the difference of (x)
$20,000,000 minus (y) the aggregate amount of all amounts paid to Buyer under
the RandW Policy as of the date on which such Losses are paid (such amount, the
"Fundamental Representation Floor"), in which case the Buyer Indemnitees shall
thereafter be entitled to indemnification for such Losses in excess of the
Fundamental Representation Floor, but only to extent the aggregate amount of
all such Losses does not exceed on a cumulative basis, together with all other
Losses pursuant to which the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
under Section 9.02(a) and Section 9.12(l), an amount equal to the Purchase
Price;

  

  

provided, further, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification for any Losses pursuant to
Section 9.02(a) and Section 9.12(l) to the extent the aggregate amount of all
such Losses exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to the Purchase
Price;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(iv) Except to the extent attributable to a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.09(e), no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled
to any indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.12(l) for
Losses consisting of or relating to Taxes with respect to any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date; and

  

  

(v) All payments under this Section 9.02 shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller pursuant to Article 1.

  

  

(c) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any conditions of contamination, including any Release or the
presence of Hazardous Substances, identified through any environmental
sampling, investigation or assessment conducted by or on behalf of Buyer which
is not: (i) affirmatively required by Environmental Laws or a Governmental
Body, (ii) precipitated by Buyer\'s reasonable determination, as communicated
to HandH Group in writing, that an environmental condition exists which would
present an imminent risk of harm to human health or materially impair the use
of the facility consistent with the property\'s use as of the Closing
(provided, however, that failure to deliver such written communication shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent Seller
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure), (iii)
required in connection with any lease arrangement in existence as of the
Closing and affecting any property leased by Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries as
of the Closing or (iv) in response to an unsolicited Third-Party Claim.
Sampling activities conducted in accordance with any of (i)-(iv) of the
foregoing sentence shall constitute "Acceptable Sampling Activities". Any
Release or presence of Hazardous Substances identified pursuant to Acceptable
Sampling Activities shall constitute an "Identified Environmental Condition".

  

  

(d) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any environmental investigatory, corrective, remedial or response
action, including such actions related to Identified Environmental Conditions
(collectively, "Response Actions") except to the extent such Response Action
(x) is attributable to a breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.16 and is (y) (i) affirmatively required by Environmental
Laws or a Governmental Body, (ii) reasonably necessary to resolve or address
an unsolicited Third-Party Claim asserting liability or potential liability
arising out of any Release or the presence of Hazardous Substances in
connection with acts, events or circumstances existing or occurring prior to
the Closing, (iii) reasonably necessary to address conditions the presence of
which would reasonably be expected to present an imminent risk of harm to
human health or materially impair the property\'s use in a manner consistent
with its use as of the Closing. Any Response Action undertaken by Buyer at a
property owned, operated or occupied by the Company, Newco or any Sold
Subsidiary shall assume the continued use of a subject property in a manner
consistent with its use as of the Closing. Buyer shall utilize the most cost-
effective and commercially reasonable remedial approach permitted by
applicable Environmental Laws, including the use of risk-based remedial
standards and engineering and institutional controls (including deed
restrictions or notices and land use restrictions), except to the extent that
the use of such risk-based remedial standards or engineering or institutional
controls would unreasonably interfere with continued use of the property in a
manner that is consistent with the property\'s use as of the Closing or, in
the case of a property owned by a third party, is not agreed to by such third
party.

(e) The parties hereby acknowledge that the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries
have been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a
potentially responsible party pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 to 9675
("CERCLA") for releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances at and
from the Omega Superfund Site. As provided in Section 9.02(a)(iv), any Omega
Site Liability shall constitute a Loss subject to the indemnification
procedures and limitations set forth in this Article 9; provided, however, as
follows:

  

  

(i) HandH Group shall retain control and responsibility for all aspects of
actual or potential Omega Site Liability and all matters related to the Omega
Superfund Site as related to Seller, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries and
that Buyer shall refrain from any action regarding actual or potential Omega
Site Liability or the Omega Superfund Site except as expressly provided
herein; provided, that HandH Group shall direct its outside counsel retained in
respect of the Omega Site Liability (such counsel, "HandH Group\'s Omega
Counsel") to provide to a representative of Buyer (which representative shall
be designated in writing by Buyer to HandH Group and may be changed upon five
(5) Business Days\' written notice by Buyer to HandH Group) copies of all
correspondence delivered to HandH Group by HandH Group\'s Omega Counsel (such
correspondence, the "Omega Correspondence"); provided, however, that, with
respect to the Omega Correspondence, Buyer shall comply with the terms and
conditions set forth on Schedule 9.02(e). Seller shall have the unqualified
right, in its sole discretion, to:

  

  

(A) Contest, defend, settle, compromise, enter into agreements, or otherwise
address any actual or potential Omega Site Liability; provided, that HandH Group
may not, without the consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any such settlement that
involves more than monetary relief and which affects the operation of the
Businesses;

  

  

(B) Participate in any way in any group of potentially responsible parties to
address in any way actual or potential Omega Site Liability or the Omega
Superfund Site;

  

  

(C) Commence, respond to, or participate in any way in any legal proceeding,
including civil or criminal litigation in local, state, or federal courts,
administrative proceedings, or other proceedings, related to actual or
potential Omega Site Liability or the Omega Superfund Site;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(D) Communicate with third parties, including any Governmental Body or
potentially responsible parties, regarding actual or potential Omega Site
Liability or the Omega Superfund Site;

  

  

(E) Investigate, assess, remediate, cleanup, or otherwise address or respond
to any issue related to the Omega Superfund Site; and

  

  

(F) Take any other actions related to actual or potential Omega Site Liability
or the Omega Superfund Site.

  

  

(f) Buyer shall promptly notify HandH Group of any and all claims, demands,
notices, or other communications from any Governmental Body regarding actual
or potential Omega Site Liability or the Omega Superfund Site following
receipt thereof and shall provide HandH Group with any and all documentation or
other information or materials received by Buyer related to such claims,
demands, notices or other communications as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

  

  

9.03 Indemnification of HandH Group and Seller. From and after the Closing (but
subject to the provisions of this Article 9), Buyer shall indemnify HandH Group,
Seller and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
agents (the "Seller Indemnitees") against and hold them harmless from any
Losses suffered or incurred by Seller Indemnitees to the extent arising from
or relating to (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in this Agreement, (ii) a breach of any covenant or agreement by
Buyer contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Buyer prior to the
Closing or by Buyer, Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries after the
Closing, and (iii) Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries at or after the
Closing or actions taken by Buyer, Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries
at or after the Closing. All payments under this Section 9.03 shall be treated
by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller pursuant to
Article 1.

  

  

9.04 Expiration of Claims. The ability of any Person to receive
indemnification under Section 9.02 or 9.03 shall terminate on the applicable
survival termination date (as set forth in Section 9.01), unless such Person
shall have incurred a Loss prior to such survival termination date and made a
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 or 9.03, as applicable,
prior to such survival termination date. If a Person has made a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 or 9.03 prior to such survival
termination date, then such claim for such Loss incurred (and only such claim
for such Loss incurred), if then unresolved, shall not be extinguished by the
passage of the deadlines set forth in Section 9.01.

  

  

9.05 Choice of Claims. The parties hereto agree that to the extent any matter
which forms the basis for a claim of indemnification under this Agreement may
constitute both a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder and a
breach of a covenant set forth in Article 6, the party seeking indemnification
shall be required to assert such matter as a breach of a representation and
warranty and may not assert such matter as a breach of a covenant.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

  

 

  

9.06 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

  

  

(a) In order for a party to be entitled to seek any indemnification provided
for under this Agreement (such party, the "Claiming Party") in respect of a
claim or demand made against the Claiming Party by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
Claiming Party must notify the party to this Agreement that is or may be
required to provide indemnification hereunder (the "Defending Party") in
writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as
reasonably practicable but in any event within fifteen (15) calendar days
after receipt by such Claiming Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification on a timely basis
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Defending Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party shall keep the Defending Party
reasonably apprised as to the status of such Third-Party Claim and shall
provide to the Defending Party, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the
Claiming Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all material notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Claiming Party relating to
the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to delivery such copies
on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the Defending Party shall have been actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure.

  

  

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses, to assume the defense thereof (subject to a reservation of rights)
with counsel selected by the Defending Party and reasonably satisfactory to
the Claiming Party (the Parties acknowledging that KandL Gates LLP is
acceptable); provided, that no Defending Party shall have the right to assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim unless (i) the Defending Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days after the
Claiming Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim that the Defending
Party will assume defense of the Third-Party Claim and will indemnify the
Claiming Party, in accordance with the provisions of this Article 9, from and
against the Losses the Claiming Party may suffer with respect to the Third-
Party Claim, (ii) the Third-Party Claim does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief as its principal remedy, (iii) the Third-Party Claim does not
involve a criminal matter and (iv) the Defending Party conducts the defense of
the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently. Should a Defending Party so
elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Defending Party shall
not be liable to the Claiming Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred
by the Claiming Party in connection with the defense thereof. The Defending
Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Claiming Party for any period during which the Defending Party has not assumed
the defense thereof. If the Defending Party assumes such defense in accordance
with this Section 9.06(b), (A) the Claiming Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Defending Party, it being
understood, however, that the Defending Party shall control such defense and
(B) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by
the Defending Party without the Claiming Party\'s consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Defending Party and the
Claiming Party shall provide, and shall cause their controlled Affiliates to
provide, as applicable, the other and its counsel with reasonable access, upon
reasonable prior written notice and during normal business hours, in a manner
so as to not unreasonably interfere in any material respect with their normal
business operations, to their respective records and personnel and shall
otherwise reasonably cooperate in the defense or settlement thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) If the Defending Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim
in accordance with Section 9.06(b), or if the Defending Party does not
actively and diligently conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the
Claiming Party may conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim at the expense
of the Defending Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Claiming Party shall not effect any settlement or compromise any
such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Defending
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  

  

9.07 Mitigation. Solely to the extent required by Law, each Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of
any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. In the
event that a Defending Party makes any payment to a Claiming Party for
indemnification for which the Claiming Party could have collected on a claim
against a third party (including under any Contract and any insurance claims),
the Defending Party shall be entitled to pursue claims and conduct litigation
on behalf of the Claiming Party and any of its successors to pursue and
collect on any indemnification or other remedy available to the Claiming Party
thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to the
rights of the Claiming Party. Except pursuant to a settlement agreed to by the
Defending Party, the Claiming Party shall not waive or release any contractual
right to recover from a third party any Loss subject to indemnification
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Defending Party. The
Claiming Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including Newco, the
Company and the Sold Subsidiaries, if applicable) to, cooperate with the
Defending Party, at the Defending Party\'s expense, with respect to any such
effort to pursue and collect with respect thereto.

  

  

9.08 Determination of Breaches and Loss Amount.

  

  

(a) For purposes of determining whether there has been any breach of a
representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining the amount of
Losses resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in any
representation or warranty or the definition of any defined term used therein
relating to or referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all
material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase
shall be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that for
purposes of determining liability under Section 9.02, the representations and
warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such
terms and phrases were not included in them; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to the representations and warranties
in Section 4.06 (Financial Statements), the first sentence and subsection
(n)(ii) of Section 4.07 (Absence of Certain Developments), Section 4.22
(Undisclosed Liabilities) and reference to the terms "Material Contract" and
"Material Permit."

  

  

(b) Losses for breaches of representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds or third-party payments
realized by and paid to the Claiming Party, in each case with such offset
reduced by any associated cost of recovery. The Claiming Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance
policies and third-party payments covering any Loss to the same extent as it
would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event
that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Claiming Party with respect
to any Loss for which any such Claiming Party has been indemnified hereunder,
then the Claiming Party shall refund promptly to the Defending Party the
aggregate amount of the recovery.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) In no event shall the Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to recover or to make
a claim for any amounts in respect of Losses to the extent punitive or
exemplary in nature (except to the extent required to be paid to a third party
that is not an Affiliate of Buyer). In addition, in no event shall a Defending
Party be liable hereunder in respect of any claim if such claim would not have
arisen but for a change in applicable Law or accounting policies or a change
in interpretation of applicable Law as determined by a court or pursuant to an
administrative rule-making decision, in each case made after the Closing Date.

  

  

(d) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification under this
Article 9 to the extent (i) such matter was specifically taken into account in
calculating the Final Closing Consideration, (ii) a specific line-item reserve
for such matter was set forth in the Financial Statements (whether or not such
line-item reserve is solely in respect of such matter or is aggregated with
other matters, so long as it is reasonably apparent on the face of the
Financial Statements or the notes thereto that such matter is the subject of
such reserve) or (iii) such matter would not have arisen but for any act,
omission, transaction or election on the part of or carried out at the written
request of, or with the written consent of, any Buyer Indemnitee or its
Affiliates before the Closing.

  

  

(e) The right of any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee to indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 will not be affected by any investigation conducted
or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing,
with respect to the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance
of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, or otherwise; provided,
however, that no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 for any Losses pursuant to those matters (if any)
identified on the Signing Date Representations Letter (which Losses shall not,
for the avoidance of doubt, be counted towards the satisfaction of any
thresholds set forth in Section 9.02(b)).

  

  

9.09 Tax Benefits. To the extent that a Claiming Party recognizes Tax Benefits
as a result of any Loss in the taxable year in which such Loss is incurred or
in the subsequent taxable year, such party shall pay the amount of such Tax
Benefits (but not in excess of the indemnification payment or payments
actually received from the Defending Party with respect to such Loss) to the
Defending Party as such Tax Benefits are actually received by the Claiming
Party. For purposes of the foregoing, "Tax Benefit" means any refund of Taxes
actually received or any actual reduction in the amount of Taxes which
otherwise would have been paid, calculated on a "with-and-without" basis.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

  

 

  

9.10 Exclusive Remedy. No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 for any Loss or other amount that
the Buyer Indemnitees may suffer, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no
remedies for any Loss or other amount that the Buyer Indemnitees may suffer
(other than (i) as set forth in Section 1.02 or Section 11.14 and (ii) for
instances of actual fraud (and then only in the event that HandH Group, Seller,
the Company or any Sold Subsidiary willfully and knowingly committed a fraud
against the Buyer Indemnitees, with specific intent to deceive and mislead the
Buyer Indemnitees regarding the representations and warranties made herein or
in any schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered pursuant hereto) or
intentional misrepresentation by HandH Group, Seller, the Company or any Sold
Subsidiary regarding the representations and warranties made herein or in any
schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered pursuant hereto) with respect to
(x) the subject matter of this Agreement or any agreement or other document
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or (y) any other matter relating to HandH Group, Seller, the Company or
any Sold Subsidiary, the operation of the Businesses, or any other transaction
or state of facts involving HandH Group, Seller, the Company or any Sold
Subsidiary (including any common law or statutory rights or remedies for
environmental, health or safety matters, including under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601, et
seq. or other Environmental Laws), other than pursuant to the express
provisions of Section 9.02, which are the Buyer Indemnitees\' sole and
exclusive remedies with respect thereto. The Buyer Indemnitees may not avoid
such limitation on liability by seeking damages for breach of contract or tort
or pursuant to any other theory of liability (other than claims of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation as described above), all of which are hereby
waived. BUYER, ON BEHALF OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES, EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS
AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE WHICH LIMITS THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO
UNKNOWN CLAIMS. BUYER, ON BEHALF OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER
OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. BUYER, ON BEHALF
OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN
ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

9.11 Acknowledgment by Buyer. Without limiting the provisions of Section
9.08(e), Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Company, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied
on the results of its own independent investigation and verification, in
addition to the representations and warranties of Seller and HandH Group
expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement and any certificate
delivered hereunder by or on behalf of Seller, HandH Group, Newco, the Company
or any of the Sold Subsidiaries. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY SELLER
AND HandH GROUP CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF SELLER AND HandH GROUP TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
(INCLUDING ANY SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE
FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR
LIABILITIES OF NEWCO, THE COMPANY OR THE SOLD SUBSIDIARIES TO ANY
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH OR SAFETY MATTERS), OR ANY OMISSION, MADE BY OR ON
BEHALF OF OR IMPUTED TO HandH GROUP, SELLER, THE COMPANY, NEWCO OR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY HandH GROUP, THE COMPANY, NEWCO AND
SELLER AND ARE NOT BEING RELIED UPON BY BUYER OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES OR
AFFILIATES.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

  

 

  

9.12 Tax Matters. The provisions of this Section 9.12 shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Buyer, Newco, the Company or the Sold
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and Seller or HandH Group, on the other hand, for
certain tax matters following the Closing:

  

  

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. Seller shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Seller Group Tax Returns
with respect to the Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods. For avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have no right to review any
Seller Group Tax Return. Buyer shall take all actions necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the end of the Company\'s taxable year for 2015 to occur on the
Closing Date for all applicable federal, foreign, state or local income Tax
purposes (by causing Newco, the Company and its Sold Subsidiaries to become a
part of the consolidated or affiliated group of Buyer and if not in the form
of a U.S. corporation, Buyer shall elect to be treated as a U.S. corporation
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes effective prior to the Closing Date), and
Seller shall take such actions necessary or appropriate to cooperate in
effectuating the end of such taxable year. If the Company, Newco or any Sold
Subsidiaries are permitted under applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as
the last calendar day of a taxable period in which the Closing occurs, Seller
and Buyer shall treat (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to treat)
the Closing Date as the last day of such taxable period with respect to the
Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries (other than
Seller Group Tax Returns) for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods which have not yet
been filed as of the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company, Newco and
the Sold Subsidiaries (including any predecessors thereof), except as
otherwise required by applicable Law; provided, however, that, (i) for the
avoidance of doubt and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, all
deductions related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are paid by Seller or HandH Group or included in Company
Transaction Expenses shall be treated as arising on or before the Closing
Date, and (ii) none of Newco, the Company or any Sold Subsidiary shall waive
any carryback of any net operating loss, capital loss or credit on any such
Tax Return filed for a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date. At
least twenty-five (25) calendar days prior to the date on which each such non-
Seller Group Tax Return is due in the case of income Tax Returns and as soon
as practicable in the case of all other Tax Returns, Buyer shall submit such
Tax Return (and all relevant work papers and other items required to
understand such Tax Return or other items as is reasonably requested by
Seller) to Seller for Seller\'s review and comment. Buyer shall make all
revisions reasonably requested by Seller to such Tax Returns to the extent
such requests are received at least five (5) calendar days prior to the date
upon which such Tax Return is due. Seller and Buyer shall work together in
good faith to resolve any differences with respect to such Tax Returns,
provided, however, that, to the extent there remains any disagreement between
Seller and Buyer with respect to such Tax Returns, the procedures and rules
set forth in the dispute resolution mechanism described in Section 1.02(c)
shall govern.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) Transfer Taxes. Any real property transfer tax, stamp tax, stock transfer
tax, or other similar Tax resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") and any penalties or interest with
respect to Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid one-half by Seller and one-
half by Buyer; provided that any such Transfer Taxes that result from the
transfer of the Excluded Subsidiaries and any penalties or interest with
respect to such Transfer Taxes shall be borne solely by Seller. The party so
obligated under applicable Law shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, agrees to cooperate with Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, in
the filing of such Tax Returns and other documentation, including promptly
supplying any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to
complete such Tax Returns and other documentation. Expenses incurred in filing
such Tax Returns shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

  

  

(d) Circular 698. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 9.12(c),
Seller shall make all filings and reportings to the People\'s Republic of
China (the "PRC") necessary under the PRC\'s circular entitled "Notice of The
State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Administration of
Enterprise Income Tax on Equity Transfer Income Derived by Non-Resident
Enterprises" (Guoshuihan [2009] No. 698), effective from January 1, 2008
onwards ("Circular 698") within the specified time period set out in Circular
698 and shall, to the extent required by applicable Law, pay when due and
payable any amounts due in respect of the Tax arising as a result of the
filing contemplated by this Section 9.12(c) to the appropriate taxing
authority of the PRC (which amounts shall be borne solely by Seller).

  

  

(e) Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. Buyer shall not take any action with
respect to the Company, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

  

  

(f) FIRPTA. Seller shall deliver to Buyer a non-foreign affidavit dated as of
the Closing Date, sworn under penalty of perjury and in form and substance
required under the Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445 of the
Code stating that HandH Group is not a "foreign person" as defined in Section
1445 of the Code (the "FIRPTA Certificate").

  

  

(g) Sections 338 and 336(e). Buyer shall not make, or cause or allow to be
made, any election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (or any other similar provision of applicable Law) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Buyer Covenants. Buyer covenants that it shall not, and shall not cause or
permit, Newco, the Company, the Sold Subsidiaries, or any other Affiliate of
Buyer, in each case without the prior written consent of Seller, (i) to make
any election in respect of the Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 that is effective on or
before the Closing Date, (ii) to take any action that would have a retroactive
effect with respect to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or would increase
any Tax liability, or reduce any Tax asset, of the Seller Group, or (iii) to
amend or refile any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, the Company,
Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Taxes to
which Buyer, the Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries become entitled in a
Tax period ending after the Closing Date, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods or portions thereof of the Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries
shall be for the account of Seller. Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such
refund received by Buyer or the amount of any such credit, net of all expenses
(including Taxes) imposed or incurred by Buyer, Newco, the Company, or the
Sold Subsidiaries with respect to such refund or credit, within fifteen (15)
calendar days after actual receipt of such refund or application of such
credit against Taxes. To the extent that any expense creates a net operating
loss in a Pre-Closing Tax Period that can, pursuant to applicable Tax law, be
carried back to an earlier taxable period to generate a refund through the
amendment of a non-Seller Group Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Buyer, at the sole expense of Seller, shall cause Newco, the Company or the
Sold Subsidiaries to amend such Tax Return for such Pre-Closing Tax Period as
soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the availability of
such refund.

  

  

(j) Tax Contests. If, in connection with any examination, investigation, audit
or other administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of any non-Seller
Group Tax Return with respect to the income or operations of the Company,
Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, any Governmental
Body issues to Newco, the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries a notice of an
examination, investigation, audit or other administrative or judicial
proceeding, a request for documents or other information, written notice of
deficiency, a notice of reassessment, a proposed adjustment, or an assertion
of claim or demand concerning the taxable period covered by such Tax Return,
Buyer shall notify Seller of its receipt of such communication from such
Governmental Body within fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving such
communication. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit Newco, the Company or the
Sold Subsidiaries to, settle or otherwise resolve any issue with respect to
any Taxes of the Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries if such settlement or
other resolution could result in Seller being liable for any amounts pursuant
to this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller. Seller shall
have the right to control any examination, investigation, audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of any non-Seller Group Tax
Return of the Company, Newco or the Sold Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period if such examination, investigation, audit or other administrative or
judicial proceeding could result in or lead to Seller being liable for any
amounts pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer, at its sole
cost and expense, shall have the right to participate in any such contest;
provided, further, that Seller shall not settle or otherwise resolve such
examination, investigation, audit or other administrative or judicial
proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, further, that
Seller and Buyer shall jointly control any examination, investigation, audit
or other administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of Taxes for a
Straddle Period. For avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have the sole right to
control and settle any examination, investigation, audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of any Seller Group Tax
Return and Buyer shall have no right to participate therein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(k) Tax Cooperation. Buyer, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries, and Seller shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 9.12 and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party\'s request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Newco, the Sold Subsidiaries and Seller agree
(i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company, Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give
the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Newco and the Sold Subsidiaries or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records. For avoidance of
doubt, Buyer shall have no right to inspect or review any Seller Group Tax
Return.

  

  

(l) Tax Indemnity. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall be indemnified by
HandH Group from and against (i) any Taxes of the Company, Newco and the Sold

11.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that, if any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and, therefore, the

11.15 Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver.

  

  

(a) Recognizing that KandL Gates LLP and Covington and Burling LLP (together, the
"Covered Counsel") have acted as legal counsel to HandH Group, Seller, the
Company, Newco, the Sold Subsidiaries and certain other of HandH Group\'s
Affiliates or direct and indirect equity holders, and that the Covered Counsel
intend to act as legal counsel to HandH Group and certain of HandH Group\'s
Affiliates or direct and indirect equity holders after Closing, Buyer hereby
waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates (including,
following Closing, Newco, the Company and any Sold Subsidiary) to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with (i) the Covered Counsel
representing any of HandH Group, Seller, the Company, Newco, the Sold
Subsidiaries and any other of HandH Group\'s Affiliates or direct and indirect
equity holders after Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, Newco
the Company or the Sold Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) the communication by the Covered Counsel to HandH Group or
any of its Affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders of any fact known
to the Covered Counsel, including in connection with any negotiation,
arbitration, mediation, litigation or other proceeding in any way related to a
dispute with any of Buyer, Newco, the Company any Sold Subsidiary or the
insurance carrier providing the RandW Policy following the Closing, and the
disclosure of any such fact in connection with any process undertaken for the
resolution of such dispute.

  

  

(b) All communications involving attorney-client confidences between any of
HandH Group or HandH Group\'s Affiliates or direct or indirect equity holders in
the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other document contemplated
by this Agreement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to HandH Group or HandH Group\'s Affiliates and direct and indirect
equity holders (and not Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following Closing,
Newco, the Company and any Sold Subsidiary) or the insurance carrier providing
the RandW Policy). Accordingly, such insurance carrier, Buyer and, following
Closing, Newco, the Company and the Sold Subsidiaries shall not have access to
any such communications, or to the respective files of the Covered Counsel
relating to such engagement, whether or not Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after Closing, (i)
HandH Group and its applicable Affiliates and direct and indirect equity holders
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to
such engagement, and none of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following
Closing, Newco, the Company and any Sold Subsidiary) shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that the respective files of the Covered Counsel
in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only HandH
Group or HandH Group\'s applicable Affiliates and direct and indirect equity
holders shall hold such property rights and (iii) neither of the Covered
Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-
client communications or files to Buyer or its Affiliates (including,
following Closing, Newco, the Company and any Sold Subsidiary) or the
insurance carrier providing the RandW Policy by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between such Covered Counsel and HandH Group or Newco or otherwise.

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any
conflicts, attorney-client confidences, attorney-client privilege, or the
ownership of any communications related thereto with respect to the
representation of Newco by the Covered Counsel relating to matters other than
as expressly provided in Section 11.15(a).
