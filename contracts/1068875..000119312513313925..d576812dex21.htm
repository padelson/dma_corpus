Liability, or (iii)&nbsp;a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim, and (b)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim unless (i)&nbsp;the sole

proceeding pursuant to this Section&nbsp;10.05 and proposes to settle such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding pursuant to this Section&nbsp;10.05. </FONT></P>
