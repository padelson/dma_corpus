Section 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares and Treatment of Company
Options_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, each Seller hereby agrees to sell, transfer, convey, assign and
deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase, acquire and
accept from each Seller, the number of Shares set forth opposite such Sellers
name on _Annex A_ hereto, which Shares constitute all of the Shares owned by
such Seller, for the consideration described in Section 2.02, below.

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each
unexpired and unexercised Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing shall be cancelled and extinguished in
consideration for a payment in cash (without interest) as described in Section
2.02. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that each unexpired and unexercised Company Option shall, to the extent not
previously vested, vest in full immediately prior to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of such Company Options.
Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (or a duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions,
and take such other actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the Company
Options to be extinguished as set forth in this Section 2.01(b).

 



10 Section 2.02 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) In consideration for the sale and delivery of the Shares by Sellers and
the cancellation of the Company Options, Purchaser, shall pay to Sellers and
the Optionholders an aggregate sum of $180,000,000, as adjusted in accordance
with this Section 2.02 and Section 2.06 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), which
shall be paid (i) to each Seller in accordance with the Estimated Closing
Statement in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (ii) to
the Company in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds for
payment to each Optionholder by the Company within three (3) Business Days
following the Closing through the Companys payroll system in accordance with
the Estimated Closing Statement, less withholdings and deductions required
under applicable Law. At the Closing, the Purchase Price will be (i)
increased or decreased (as applicable) by the Estimated Net Working Capital
Overage or the Estimated Net Working Capital Shortage (ii) increased by the
Estimated Closing Cash and (iii) decreased by the amount required at
Closing to discharge in full the Company Debt and the amount required at
Closing to discharge in full the Company Transaction Expenses (including
Company Transaction Expenses payable following the Closing). After the
Closing, the parties will determine the Closing Net Working Capital Overage
(if any) or Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any), and make such
payments as provided in Section 2.06.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause the Escrow
Agent to, execute and deliver an escrow agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").
At Closing, Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent $13,500,000 (the "
_Escrow Amount_ "), to be held by the Escrow Agent in an account (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in
order to secure, in part, Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to
Article X and Sellers payment obligation, if any, under Section 2.06. Not
later than three (3) Business Days after the twelve-month anniversary of the
Closing, an amount equal to (i) $9,250,000 minus (ii) the sum of (A) the
aggregate unpaid amounts, if any, required to be, but not yet distributed from
the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and (B) as to any
unresolved claim, the aggregate amount specified in the notice submitted to
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (which amount shall be held
in and released from the Escrow Account upon resolution of any such
unresolved claims pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement) shall be
released to the Sellers pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (such
amount, the " _Released Escrow Amount_ " and the difference between the
Escrow Amount and the Released Escrow Amount, the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_
"). The Remaining Escrow Amount will be retained by the Escrow Agent pursuant
to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in order to secure
Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) with
respect to breaches of Fundamental Representations, breaches of the
representations set forth in Section 4.15 (Taxes) and Section 10.02(a)(iii).
Not later than three (3) Business Days after the twenty-four month
anniversary of the Closing, an amount equal to (i) the Remaining Escrow Amount
minus (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid amounts, if any, required to
be, but not yet distributed from the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and (B) as to any unresolved claim, the aggregate amount specified
in the notice submitted to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
(which amount shall be held in and released from the Escrow Account upon
resolution of any such unresolved claims pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement) shall be released to the Sellers pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount and Remaining Escrow Amount shall be held
and disbursed in accordance with the terms of the

 



11  Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. For the avoidance doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Amount shall be deducted from the
amounts otherwise payable to Sellers and not from the amounts payable to the
Optionholders.

Section 2.03 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California, 90071
on the second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02 (other than the conditions, which by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) (the " _Closing Date_ "), or at such other place or
at such other time or on such other date as the Company and Purchaser may
mutually agree upon in writing.

 

Section 2.04 _Closing Deliveries by Sellers_. At the Closing, each Seller
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser:

through the Companys payroll system within three (3) Business Days following
the Closing);

(c) to Sellers, a true and complete copy, certified by the Secretary of

Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser a written closing statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth (i) the good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital of the
Company as of the Closing (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), including
the resulting Estimated Net Working Capital Overage (if any) or the Estimated
Net Working Capital Shortage (if any), together with a reasonably detailed
explanation of the calculation thereof, (ii) the Company Debt, (iii) the good
faith estimate of the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (iv) the Company Transaction Expenses (including
the amounts payable to each applicable Person) to be paid as of the Closing or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event following the
Closing, (v) the portion of the Purchase Price (less the Escrow Amount) to be
paid to each Seller, (vi) the portion of the Escrow Amount allocated to each
Seller and (vii) the portion of the Purchase Price to be paid to each
Optionholder. A sample calculation of the Net Working Capital based on the
Reference Balance Sheet is set forth in _Annex B_. The Estimated Net Working
Capital shall be determined in good faith and in accordance with GAAP on a
basis

 



13  consistent with the preparation of the Reference Balance Sheet. The
effective time of the Closing for purposes of calculating the Estimated Net
Working Capital and the Closing Net Working Capital shall be 11:59 p.m. on
the Closing Date. The calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Closing Net Working Capital shall use the same methodology as the calculation
of the sample calculation of the Net Working Capital as set forth on  _Annex
B_.

(b) _Final Closing Statement_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, and in any event within forty-five (45) calendar days
thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a written statement (the "
_Final Closing Statement_ ") consisting of (i) a balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of
the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing, as derived from the
Closing Balance Sheet and otherwise in accordance herewith (the " _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), along with the resulting Closing Net Working Capital
Overage (if any) or Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any) and (iii)
the final Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Cash_ "). Any amounts determined pursuant to the Final Closing
Statement shall be paid to either Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.06(d). The Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
and shall use the same methodology as the calculation of the sample
calculation of the Net Working Capital as set forth on _Annex B_.

(c)  _Disputes_. Upon delivery of the Final Closing Statement, Purchaser will
provide to Sellers and their representatives reasonable access to the books
and records of the Company, to the extent reasonably related to the evaluation
of the Closing Balance Sheet and the (i) calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital Overage (if any) or Closing
Net Working Capital Shortage (if any) and (ii) determination of the Closing
Cash. If Sellers disagree with any amount set forth on the Final Closing
Statement or any element of the Closing Balance Sheet relevant thereto,
Sellers shall notify Purchaser of such disagreement in writing within thirty
(30) days after its receipt of the Final Closing Statement, which notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement ("
_Notice of Disagreement_ "). In the event that Sellers do not provide a Notice
of Disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, Sellers shall be deemed
to have accepted the Final Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser, which
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the
event any such Notice of Disagreement is timely provided within such
thirty (30) day period by Sellers, Purchaser and Sellers shall negotiate in
good faith for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the amounts set
forth on the Final Closing Statement and identified in the Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of such period, Purchaser and Sellers are unable
to resolve such disagreements, then an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Purchaser and
Sellers ( _provided_ such accounting firm shall have no existing relationship
with Purchaser, the Company or the Sellers) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve
any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Auditor, based solely on written submissions
provided by Purchaser and Sellers to the Auditor within ten (10) days
following the Auditors selection, whether the Closing Balance Sheet was
prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2.06(b) and
(only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Auditor)
whether and to what extent (if any) the determinations of the Closing Cash or
the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Net Working Capital Overage or
Closing Net Working Capital Shortage require adjustment. The fees and expenses
of 

 



14  the Auditor shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Sellers. The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. The date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally determined
in accordance with this Section 2.06(c) is referred as to the " _Determination
Date_."

(d) _Payment_. Any amounts determined to be due and owing to Sellers from
Purchaser or to Purchaser from Sellers, as applicable, pursuant to this
Section 2.06 shall be paid, in accordance with the allocation percentages set
forth on _Annex A_ , by Sellers to Purchaser or by Purchaser to Sellers, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within five (5)
days after the applicable Determination Date. 

Section 2.07 _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser, the Company or the Escrow Agent,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) before making any such
deduction or withholding with respect to any Seller, Purchaser, the Company or
the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall give the Sellers notice of the
intention to make such deduction or withholding (such notice, which shall
include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed
deduction or withholding, shall be given at least a commercially
reasonable period of time before such deduction or withholding is required,
in order for the Sellers to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction
or withholding), (b) Purchaser, the Company or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, shall cooperate with the Sellers to the extent reasonable in
efforts to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding,
and (c) Purchaser, the Company or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall
timely remit to the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all amounts so
deducted or withheld and timely file all Tax Returns and provide to the
Sellers such information statements and other documents required to be filed
or provided under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental
Authority by Purchaser, the Company or the Escrow Agent, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

and valid title, right and interest in and to all of the tangible personal
property material to the operation of the business of the Company as

licensed by the Company are in good operating condition and repair, subject
to ordinary wear and tear, and are sufficient to permit the Company to
continue to operate the Business, except as would not reasonably be expected

Section 4.13 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Section 4.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each Plan. " _Plan_ "
shall mean each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")) and
each other compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that is (i)
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company for the benefit of any
of its current or former employees, directors, officers, agents or independent
contractors (or any dependent or beneficiary of any of any such individuals),
or (ii) with respect to which the Company has (or could reasonably be
expected to have) any current or future Liability (whether fixed or
contingent). The Company has made available to Purchaser a true and complete
copy of each Plan.

 

(b) With respect to each Plan, except as would not subject the Company or
Purchaser to any material liability: (i) such Plan is, and at all times since
inception has been, established, maintained, administered, operated and funded
in all respects in compliance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws; (ii) none of the Company, any Seller, any Affiliate of the
Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other fiduciary of such Plan
has engaged in any transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner that
violates the fiduciary requirements of ERISA or any other applicable Law;
(iii) no non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 or 407 of ERISA
or under Section 4975 of the Code has occurred or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is threatened or about to occur (including any of the transactions
contemplated in or by this Agreement); (iv) all contributions, premiums and
other payments due or required to be paid to (or with respect to) such Plan
have been paid on or before their

 



22  respective due dates and within any time period prescribed by ERISA, or, if

the extent required by GAAP; and (v) the Company has not incurred, and to the
Knowledge of the Company no condition or set of circumstances currently
exists, that would cause the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates to incur, directly or indirectly, any penalty or excise tax
imposed under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law with respect to such
Plan. No Action is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). No Plan is

Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), which letter covers the Pension Protection
Act of 2006, has pending or has time remaining in which to file an application
for, and to make any amendments necessary to obtain, such a determination
letter from the IRS, or is a prototype or volume submitter plan
entitled, under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the favorable opinion or
advisory letter issued by the IRS to the sponsor of such prototype or volume
submitter plan. Nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or to require the filing of
a submission under the IRSs employee plans compliance resolution system or
the taking of any corrective action pursuant to such system in order to
maintain the qualified status of such Plan.

(d) No Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA or a pension plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and the Company has no direct, indirect or contingent
Liability with respect to any such plan. The Company has no Liability with
respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)

in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for

the Code satisfies in form and operation the requirements of Sections
409A(a)(2), 409A(a)(3) and 409A(a)(4) of the Code and the guidance thereunder
(and has satisfied such requirements for the entire period during which
Section 409A of the Code has applied to such Plan). No Company Option (or
other right to acquire any share of the Company) is or has ever been a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code. The Company has no agreement or obligation to
indemnify or "gross-up" any individual for any Taxes or interest imposed on

(a) Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) in a manner consistent
with past practices, except as otherwise required by Law, and file (or cause
to be filed) all Tax Returns of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
that are filed after the Closing Date. Prior to the filing of any such Tax
Return, Purchaser shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) a draft of such Tax
Return to Sellers at least five (5) days, or, in the case of any Income Tax
Return for any Tax period ending on the Closing Date or that portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, at least twenty (20) days prior to
the date such Tax Return is to be filed, shall permit Sellers to review and
comment on such Tax Returns and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns
as are reasonably requested by Sellers.

(b) Unless otherwise required by Law, Purchaser shall not amend (or cause to
be amended) any Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
make (or cause to be made) any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without the prior written consent of
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 9.02 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Purchaser, the Company and Sellers
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties, in connection with the filing or amendment of Tax Returns pursuant
to this Agreement, any Tax Contest, and complying with the provisions of
Section 9.07. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
parties request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

 



41 Section 9.03 _Contest Provisions_.

 

If, subsequent to the Closing, Purchaser or the Company receives notice of a
Tax Contest with respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall
promptly notify Sellers of such notice. Purchaser shall have the right to
control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Purchaser shall keep Sellers reasonably informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest and shall not effect any settlement or compromise
of such Tax Contest without obtaining Sellers prior written consent thereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
, _further_ , that Sellers shall have the right to control, at the Sellers
expense, the conduct and resolution of any such Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) that would be subject to
indemnification under Section 10.02, and would not be expected to increase or
otherwise adversely affect the Taxes of the Purchaser or the Company in a
Post-Closing Tax Period, _provided_ , that (i) Sellers shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax Contest, (ii) Purchaser shall
have the right to participate, at the Purchasers expense, in the conduct and
resolution of any such Tax Contest, and (iii) Sellers shall not effect any
settlement or compromise of any such Tax Contest without obtaining Purchasers
prior written consent thereto, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, if such settlement or compromise would increase the
liability for Taxes of Purchaser or the Company in a Post-Closing Tax Period;
_provided_ , _however_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
have the right to control or assume control of any such Tax Contest if the
Sellers fail to assume control of the conduct and resolution of any Tax
Contest within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the notice from the
Purchaser or Sellers fail to diligently contest such Tax Contest, provided,
that Purchaser shall keep Sellers reasonably informed of the progress of such
Tax Contest and shall not effect any settlement or compromise of such Tax
Contest without obtaining Sellers prior written consent thereto, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event of any
conflict or overlap between the provisions if this Section 9.03 and Section
10.05, the provisions of this Section 9.03 shall control.

 

Section 9.04 _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state and local transfer, stamp,
documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty-percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty-percent
(50%) by the Sellers. Purchaser hereby agrees to file in a timely manner all
necessary documents (including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with
respect to all such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Transfer
Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority in Korea shall be borne
exclusively by Sellers, and Sellers hereby agree to file in a timely manner
all necessary documents (including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns)
with respect to all such amounts.

Section 9.05 _FIRPTA_. The Company shall deliver to Purchaser at the Closing
all necessary forms and certificates complying with applicable Law, duly
executed and acknowledged, certifying that the transactions contemplated
hereby are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

 

Section 9.06 _Refunds_. Sellers shall be entitled to the amount of any refund
or credit of Taxes of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(to the extent such Taxes were paid by the Company prior to the Closing or by
Sellers after the Closing) which refund or credit is actually recognized by
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the Company) after the Closing, net
of any cost to Purchaser and its Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and

 



42  receipt of such refund or credit, except to the extent such refund or credit
arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or such refund
or credit was included as an asset in the calculation of the Closing Working
Capital. Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Sellers any amount to
which Sellers are entitled pursuant to the prior sentence promptly upon the
receipt or recognition of the applicable refund or credit by Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries. To the extent requested by the Sellers Purchaser will reasonably
cooperate with Sellers in obtaining such refund or credit, including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns for periods ending before or on the Closing
Date or refund claims. To the extent such refund or credit is subsequently
disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax authority, Sellers
agree promptly to repay the amount of such refund or credit, together with
any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Tax
authority, to Purchaser.

Section 9.07 _Transaction Tax Benefits_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that:

 

(a) The Transaction Tax Benefit Items, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
shall be reported on applicable Income Tax Returns solely as Income Tax
deductions of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall not be
treated or reported as Income Tax deductions for a Post-Closing Tax Period
(including under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or
any comparable or similar provision under state or local Law). In connection
with the foregoing, unless otherwise requested by Sellers, Purchaser shall
cause the Company to make an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18
IRB 746, to treat 70% of any success-based fees that were paid by or on
behalf of the Company, and that were included in the Transaction Tax Benefit
Schedule, as an amount that did not facilitate the purchase and sale of the
Shares hereunder and therefore as deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes.

(b) To the extent that the Company has paid estimated Income Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the amount of the estimated Income Taxes that were
paid with respect to such Tax period exceeds the amount of the estimated
Income Tax liability with respect to such Tax period (taking into account
the Transaction Tax Benefit Items), the Sellers shall prepare or cause to be
prepared IRS Form 4466 (Corporation Application for Quick Refund of
Overpayment of Estimated Tax) with any other IRS forms as may be reasonably
necessary (including IRS Form 8302 (Electronic Deposit of Tax Refund of $1
Million or More)) and any analogous application for a state refund of an
overpayment of estimated state Income Taxes with respect to such Tax period.
Any such refund application shall be treated as an Income Tax Return that is
subject to analogous review, comment, dispute resolution and filing procedures
to those set forth in Section 9.01(a). Within 15 Business Days of the receipt
from the applicable Governmental Authority of a refund as a result of such a
refund application, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to
such refund to accounts designated by Sellers for distribution to Sellers,
except to the extent the amount of such refund was taken into account
in computing Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined under Section
2.06.

(c) To the extent that the Company has a net operating loss that is
attributable to the deduction of Transaction Tax Benefit Items, Sellers shall
prepare or cause to be prepared any claim for refund (including IRS Form 1139
or any successor form, and any comparable state or local forms) or amended
Tax Return to effect a carryback of such loss (a " _TTB Carryback_ ") to

 



43  the fullest extent permitted by Law. Any such refund claim shall be treated
as an Income Tax Return that is subject to analogous review, comment, dispute
resolution and filing procedures to those set forth in Section 9.01(a).
Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any TTB Carryback shall be
utilized to its fullest extent prior to the utilization of any carryback of
any Tax attribute of the Company generated during a Post-Closing Tax Period.
Within 15 Business Days of the receipt from the applicable Governmental
Authority of a refund as a result of such a refund claim, Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid an amount equal to such refund to accounts designated by
Sellers for distribution to Sellers, except to the extent the amount of such
refund was taken into account in computing Closing Net Working Capital as
finally determined under Section 2.06.

 

Section 9.08 _Section 280G_. The Company will, prior to the Closing Date,
submit to a stockholder vote the right of any "Disqualified Individual" to
receive or retain, as the case may be, any and all payments and other benefits
contingent on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the
extent necessary so that in the event the requisite approval (solicited in
accordance with the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
including QandA 7 of Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) is obtained, no such
payment or benefit received or which could be received by such "Disqualified
Individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code
(collectively, " _Parachute Payments_ "). Before the vote is submitted to
stockholders, the Company will provide disclosure to its stockholders of all
material facts concerning the Parachute Payments in a manner that satisfies
Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Within a reasonable period of time prior to the vote, Purchaser and its
counsel shall have the right to review and comment on all documents to be
delivered to the stockholders of the Company in connection with such vote and
any required Disqualified Individual waivers or consents, and the Company
shall reflect in good faith all reasonable comments of Purchaser thereon.

excess of the portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller.

Section 10.03 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to Section 10.04, from
and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers and their Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,

an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser

use under applicable Law.

(f) The amount of Losses payable pursuant to this Article X shall be net of
insurance proceeds or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of Indemnification. The calculation of Loss shall not include losses arising
because of a change in Law after Closing.

(g) For purposes of this Article X and determining whether a breach of a
representation or warranty has occurred and calculating Losses in connection
with a claim for indemnification under this Article X, the parties agree that
each representation or warranty that contains any qualification as to

deemed to have been given as though there were no such qualification and any
such qualification shall be disregarded for purposes of this Article X.

(h) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses relating to
any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that
the Indemnified Party has already recovered the same Losses with respect to
such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement or such Losses

the Closing Net Working Capital and any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.06_. 

 



46 Section 10.05 _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_. An Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of any matter which an
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement describing in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances with respect to such claim, stating the amount of
the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises (such notice a " _Claim Notice_ ").
With respect to a breach of any representation or warranty, the Claim Notice
must be received on or prior to the date on which the representation or
warranty on which such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in
Section 10.01, irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or
Action shall have occurred before or after such date. If the matter is a claim
brought by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim
at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim (a) that seeks as a
sole or primary remedy an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, (b) that relates to the Purchaser Indemnified Partys
relationship or business dealings with a customer or vendor, in each case
which is material to the Companys business, or (c) if the Indemnifying Party
fails to accept the defense of the Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of the notice from the Indemnified Party or it fails to
diligently contest the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
undertake any such defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, (a) the
Indemnified Party shall not settle, pay, or permit to be paid, any part
of such Third Party Claim unless (i) the Indemnifying Party consents in
writing (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such
payment, (ii) the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such Third
Party Claim Liability, or (iii) a final judgment from which no appeal may be
taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the
Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim, and (b) the Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim unless (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages,
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law in connection
therewith and there is no material adverse effect on any other claims that may
be made against such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (ii) each
Indemnified Party that is a party to such Third Party Claim is fully and
unconditionally released from liability with respect to such claim, and (iii)
such settlement, compromise or resolution will not, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Party, be reasonably likely to establish a
precedent, custom or practice that is materially adverse to the continuing
business interests of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party assumes
the defense of any such claims or proceeding pursuant to this Section 10.05
and proposes to settle such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment
thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or
assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding pursuant to this
Section 10.05.

 



47 Section 10.06 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except for injunctive and provisional
relief (including specific performance), Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge
and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this
Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company, Purchaser
and Sellers with respect to the matters arising under or relating to this
Agreement, any other agreements, instruments and documents required hereby to
be executed and delivered and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including, without limitation, any Losses from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortuous conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise);
_provided_ that this provision shall not limit any remedies available to
Sellers in respect of a breach of Sections 6.02(b) or 6.07. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section 10.06 shall not apply
to any claim for Losses as a result of or arising out of or by virtue
of fraud of any party hereto.

Section 10.07 _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification payments to be made by
Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to this Article X, as the case may be, shall be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the Indemnified Party within five (5) business days
after the final determination thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , any
indemnification payments owing from Sellers shall first be recovered by
Purchaser from the Escrow Amount until no amounts remain in the Escrow
Account.

 

Section 10.08 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payments made
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article X shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state and local Income Tax
purposes except as otherwise required under applicable Law.

the Closing.

 

(b) By either Purchaser or Sellers, by written notice to the other party, if
(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before the Outside Date, other than as

48 (d) Prior to the Closing, by written notice to Sellers from Purchaser if there
is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of the Company or Sellers set forth in this Agreement, or if a
representation or warranty of the Company or Sellers shall be untrue in any
material respect, in either case, such that the condition specified in
Section 7.02(a) hereof would not be satisfied at the Closing, (a "
_Terminating Seller Breach_ ") except that, if such Terminating Seller Breach
is curable by the breaching party through the exercise of its commercially
reasonable efforts, then, for a period lasting until the earlier of the
Business Day prior to the Outside Date and 30 days after receipt of notice
from Purchaser requesting such breach to be cured (the " _Seller Cure Period_
"), such termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Seller Breach is not cured prior to the
Seller Cure Period.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, by written notice from Sellers to Purchaser if there
is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
on the part of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or if a representation
or warranty of Purchaser shall be untrue in any material respect, in either
case, such that the condition specified in Section 7.01(a) hereof would not
be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Purchaser Breach_ "), except
that, if such Terminating Purchaser Breach is curable by Purchaser through the
exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then, for a period lasting
until the earlier of the Business Day prior to the Outside Date and 30 days
after receipt of notice from Sellers requesting such breach to be cured (the "
_Purchaser Cure Period_ "), such termination shall not be effective, and such
termination shall become effective only if the Terminating Purchaser Breach is
not cured within the Purchaser Cure Period.

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part
of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates, officers, directors or
shareholders, other than the liability of Purchaser, the Company or Sellers,
as the case may be, for any intentional and willful breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination, and the parties hereto acknowledge that
it is the intention of the parties hereto that no party shall have any remedy
or right to recover for any Losses resulting from any breach of
any representation and warranty contained herein. The provisions of Section
6.02(b) and this Article XI shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 12.03 _Public Announcements_. No party to this Agreement shall make,
or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
communicate with any news media without the prior written consent of the other
parties unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange
regulation, and the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as to the timing
and contents of any such press release, public announcement or communication.

Section 12.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is deemed by any court to be violative of Law or public policy and therefore
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

Section 12.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, between the Company, Sellers and
Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 12.06 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors,
assigns, heirs, executors and administrators; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party to this Agreement may assign its rights or delegate any or all of its
obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of
each of the other parties to this Agreement (which consent may be granted or
withheld in such parties sole discretion).

Section 12.07 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each party
hereto, or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 12.08.

Section 12.08 _Waiver_. The parties to this Agreement may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties contained herein or in any 

 



51  document delivered by the other parties pursuant hereto, or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements of the other parties or conditions to
such parties obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

 

Section 12.09 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including the provisions of Article X relating to indemnified

or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement.

Section 12.10 _Neutral Construction_. The parties agree that this Agreement
was negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are the product
of the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been
jointly and equally drafted by the Company, Sellers and Purchaser, and the
provisions hereof should not be construed against a party on the grounds that
the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision.

Section 12.11 _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

Section 12.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California. All Actions
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any California federal court sitting in the County of San
Bernardino; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court does not have
jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any California state court sitting in the County of San
Bernardino. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby
(a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court sitting in the County of San Bernardino in the State of California for
the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought
by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way
of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper,
or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

 

Section 12.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A

Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to otherwise
specifically enforce the performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at law or in equity.

Section 12.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or electronic mail in portable document
format) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 

Section 12.16 _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to
the performance of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.17 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
partners, officers, employees and affiliates, that Latham and Watkins LLP may
serve as counsel to Sellers, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Latham and Watkins LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to
