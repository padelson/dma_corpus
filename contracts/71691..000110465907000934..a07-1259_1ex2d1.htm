and

  

(xiv) the assets and rights expressly set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)(xiv)_.

Purchaser that one or more Contracts that were in effect on the date of this
Agreement and the Seller intended to be listed in _Schedule 4.7(a)_ were
inadvertently omitted, then, subject to the Purchasers prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld), such Contract or Contracts shall
for all purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be a Business
Contract included in the Station Assets.

  

(e) _Assets Owned by Affiliates of the Sellers_. To the extent any Station
Assets are owned, leased, used or held for use by an Affiliate of a Seller,
the Sellers shall cause such Affiliate to transfer all of such Station Assets
either to the Sellers prior to Closing or directly to the Purchaser at
Closing.

  

2.2 _Assumption of Liabilities_.

  

(a) _Assumption_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth

(and thereafter pay, perform, discharge or otherwise satisfy in accordance
with their respective terms),

     

   

and each of the Sellers shall irrevocably convey, transfer and assign to the

Closing Date), (ii) under Business Contracts included in the Station Assets
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(vii) arising out of or related to the ownership,
operation or conduct of the Business on and after the Closing Date (except to
the extent such Liabilities are attributable to the period prior to the
Closing Date), and (iii) arising out of or relating to the operation by the
Purchaser of the Business and/or the Station Assets (but only to the extent
such Liabilities are attributable to the period on or after the Closing
Date), excluding in each instance any such Liabilities that constitute
Excluded Liabilities (as defined below), and (iv) to the extent taken into
consideration in the determination of Closing Working Capital.

  

(c) _Excluded Liabilities_. The Purchaser shall not assume or be liable for
(and Assumed Liabilities shall not mean, refer to or include) any Liabilities

(v) Liabilities of a Seller in respect of transaction costs payable by it

_Schedule 2.2(c)(viii)_ ;

  

(ix) Liabilities of a Seller, its Affiliates or any other Person arising out

Closing Working Capital; and

  

(x) Liabilities arising out of any Intellectual Property that is not Business
Intellectual Property.

  

2.3 _Consideration for Station Assets_.

  

(a) _Consideration_. Subject to Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c), the
aggregate consideration to the Sellers for the Station Assets shall be
(i) $575,000,000 in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.3(b)
(the " _Purchase Price_ ") and (ii) the assumption by the Purchaser of the
Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall agree in good faith as to the portion of the
Purchase Price that is to be paid by the Purchaser to each of the Sellers as
consideration for the Station Assets being sold by such Seller.

  

(b) Working Capital Adjustment.

  

(i) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term " _Working
Capital_ " shall mean (A) the aggregate value of the current assets of the
Business included within the Station Assets, minus (B) the sum of (x) the
aggregate value of the current liabilities of the Business included within
the Assumed Liabilities, each calculated as of 11:59 pm on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment Time_ "), in
accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of
the Financial Statements and (y) the Capital Expenditures Deficiency. For
the purpose of clarity, an illustrative calculation of Working Capital,
calculated based on the Latest Balance Sheet, is attached hereto as _Schedule
2.3(b)_.

  

(ii) Not more than five (5) Business Days, but in no event less than two (2)
Business Days, before the Closing, the Sellers shall in good faith prepare
and deliver to the Purchaser an estimated unaudited combined balance sheet of
the Business (" _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), dated as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing, setting forth the Sellers estimate of the
Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ ") as of the
Adjustment Time. The Sellers will make available to the Purchaser all
records and work papers used in preparing the Sellers estimate of the
Working Capital and the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of any good faith
disagreement with such calculation. The Sellers shall revise the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet to reflect the resolution of any such
disagreement upon which the Sellers and the Purchaser may agree.  The
Purchase Price payable at the Closing will be

     

   

increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount by which
Estimated Working Capital exceeds $23,201,412 (the " _Working Capital Target_
") or in the alternative, decreased on a dollar for dollar basis by the
amount by which the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Target.

  

(iii) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) calendar
days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Sellers an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Business
as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") and statement relating to the Business (the " _Statement of Working
Capital_ ") setting forth the Working Capital as of the Adjustment Time (the
" _Closing Working Capital_ "). The Purchaser shall afford the Sellers and
their agents and representatives access to all books, records and work papers
in order to allow them to review the Closing Balance Sheet and the Statement
of Working Capital.

  

(iv) If the Sellers disagree in good faith with the Statement of Working
Capital, then the Sellers shall notify the Purchaser in writing (the "
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") of such disagreement within thirty (30) calendar
days following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Statement of
Working Capital. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for the disagreement described therein. Thereafter, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve and finally
determine the amount of the Closing Working Capital.  If the Sellers and the
Purchaser are unable to resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) calendar
days following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, then the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall select a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized
independent accounting firm that does not then have a relationship with the
Sellers or the Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "), to resolve the disagreement and make a
determination with respect thereto as promptly as practicable; _provided_
that if the Sellers and the Purchaser cannot agree, the Independent
Accountant shall be selected by an accounting firm designated by the
Purchaser and an accounting firm designated by the Sellers. Such
determination will be made, and written notice thereof given to the Sellers
and the Purchaser, within thirty (30) calendar days after such selection. The
determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Sellers and the Purchaser. The scope of the Independent
Accountants engagement (which will not be an audit) shall be limited to the
resolution of the unresolved disputed items described in the Notice of
Disagreement, and the recalculation, if any, of the Closing Working Capital
in light of such resolution.  Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, the Independent Accountant shall make such determination
in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and shall not
award an amount more favorable to the Purchaser than the corresponding
amounts claimed by the Purchaser on its Statement of Working Capital or more
favorable to the Sellers than the corresponding amounts claimed by the
Sellers in their Notice of Disagreement. If an Independent Accountant is
engaged pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(iv), the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the Sellers, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other.

     

   

(v) Within ten (10) calendar days after (x) the expiration of the thirty (30)
day period after delivery of the Statement of Working Capital if no Notice of
Disagreement shall have been delivered, (y) the resolution by the Sellers and
the Purchaser of the items in any Notice of Disagreement or (z) the delivery
of a notice of determination by the Independent Accountant as described
above, as the case may be, any payment required by this Section 2.3(b)(v)
shall be made based on such determination of Closing Working Capital.  In
the event that the Closing Working Capital is:

  

(A) less than the Estimated Working Capital, the Sellers shall pay to the
Purchaser an amount in cash equal to Estimated Working Capital _minus_ the
Closing Working Capital by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Purchaser;

  

(B) greater than the Estimated Working Capital, the Purchaser shall pay to
the Sellers, an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital, _minus_ the
Estimated Working Capital by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by the Sellers; or

  

(C) equal to the Estimated Working Capital, no payments shall be made
pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(v).

  

Any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be
allocated among the Sellers in proportion to the allocation of Purchase Price
among them pursuant to Section 2.3(a).

  

(c) _Broadcast Cash Flow Deficiency Purchase Price Adjustment_.  Not more
than five (5) Business Days, but in no event less than two (2) Business Days,
before the Closing, the Sellers shall in good faith prepare and deliver to
the Purchaser a calculation of the Broadcast Cash Flow for 2006. The Sellers
will make available to the Purchaser all records and work papers used in
preparing said calculation and the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of any
good faith disagreement with such calculation. The Sellers shall revise the
calculation of Broadcast Cash Flow for 2006 to reflect the resolution of any
such disagreement upon which the Sellers and the Purchaser may agree. In the
event the Broadcast Cash Flow for 2006 reflects a Broadcast Cash Flow
Deficiency, the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be decreased on a
dollar for dollar basis by the amount of the Broadcast Cash Flow Deficiency
Purchase Price Adjustment. In the event the Sellers and the Purchaser cannot
agree on the calculation of the Broadcast Cash Flow for 2006, the Purchase
Price payable at Closing shall be adjusted based upon the resolution of any

(d) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The consideration for the Station Assets
provided herein shall be allocated among the various categories of Station

Returns in a manner consistent with the allocation determined pursuant to

3.5 _Assignment of Business Contracts and Business Licenses_. Except as
specifically provided in this Section 3.5, to the extent that transfer or
assignment hereunder by the Sellers to the Purchaser of any Business Contract
or Business License is not permitted or is not permitted without the consent
or approval of another Person, this Agreement shall not be deemed to
constitute an undertaking to assign the same if such consent or approval is
not given or if such an undertaking otherwise would constitute a breach
thereof or cause a loss of benefits thereunder. The Sellers (and the Purchaser
where required) shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
and all such third party consents or approvals under all Business Contracts
and Business Licenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Sellers nor
the Purchaser shall be required to pay or incur any cost or expense to obtain
any third party consent or approval that it is not otherwise required to pay
or incur in accordance with the terms of the applicable Business Contract or
Business License, except for usual legal fees and expenses. The Purchaser will
not be required to accept or agree or accede to any condition to transfer any
Business Contract or Business License, or any modifications or amendments to
such Business Contract or Business License that would make, or would be
reasonably likely to make, such underlying Business Contract or Business
License, in the aggregate, materially more onerous or that would materially
reduce, or would be reasonably likely to

     

   

materially reduce, the benefits available under the Business Contract or
Business License in respect of which the consent or new replacement relates.
If any such third party consent or approval for the assignment or transfer of
a Business Contract or Business License has not been obtained before the
Closing, at the election of the Purchaser such Business Contract or Business
License shall not constitute a Station Asset until such time as the consent
shall have been obtained and, at the election of the Purchaser, the Sellers
shall cooperate with the Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement designed to
provide for the Purchaser after the Closing the benefits intended to be
assigned to the Purchaser under the applicable Business Contract or Business
License, including enforcement at the cost and for the account of the
Purchaser of any and all rights of the Sellers against the other party
thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party
or otherwise; _provided_ that the Purchaser shall (i) undertake to pay or
satisfy the corresponding Liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to
the extent that the Purchaser would have been responsible therefor hereunder
if such consent, waiver or approval had been obtained and (ii) indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates for any costs, expenses or
Liabilities (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by them in
connection with the enforcement of such Business Contract or Business
License.  The Purchaser shall have the right to require the Sellers to assign
any such Business Contract or Business License to the Purchaser at or after
Closing without first having obtained all consents necessary for such
assignment, _provided_  that the Sellers shall not be responsible for any
breach resulting therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
agree that obtaining the FCC Consent with respect to the FCC Licenses is
provided for in Section 6.4 and not this Section 3.5.

their obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation by the

contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser shall be Solvent

reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured, or (ii) the

rise to a right to payment, whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured; and (d) "
_Present Fair Salable Value_ " means the amount that may be realized if the
aggregate assets of the Purchaser (including goodwill) are sold as an

during normal business hours, to the Station Assets and all of its relevant
books, records and documents of or relating to the Business and the Station
Assets (including, subject to compliance with applicable Law, personnel
records),

     

   

and shall furnish to the Purchaser such information and data, financial
records and other documents in their possession and in the possession of
their Affiliates relating to the Business and the Station Assets as the
Purchaser may reasonably request, and reasonable access to the
Business Employees for purposes of discussing future employment opportunities
and communicating the Purchasers intentions regarding the terms and
conditions of employment following Closing; _provided_ that such access shall
not unduly disrupt the normal operations of the Business; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that except as provided in Section 6.13, the Purchaser shall not
have access or the right to conduct any invasive sampling (including any
soil, ground water or surface water sampling) at the Real Properties.

  

6.3 _Confidentiality_. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
from the date hereof until the Closing in accordance with the terms thereof,
such that the information obtained by the Purchaser, or its
officers, employees, agents or representatives, in connection with the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise, shall be governed by the
terms set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event of the termination of this Agreement, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement incorporated herein by reference shall survive in
accordance with its terms. From and after the Closing until the fifth
anniversary thereof, the Sellers covenant and agree that they shall maintain
the confidentiality of all non-public information relating to the Business,
the Stations or the Station Assets to the same extent, and subject to the
same terms and conditions, as imposed upon the Purchaser under
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

6.4 _Further Actions_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including the terms of Section 6.4(b)), the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation (but subject
to Section 3.5): (i) obtaining all necessary Licenses, actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents or approvals, authorizations, qualifications and other
orders of any Governmental Authorities with competent jurisdiction over the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) obtaining all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
with respect to Business Contracts and Business Licenses shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 3.5.

  

(b) Also in furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.4(a), the
Purchaser and the Sellers each shall prepare and file with the FCC as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
execution of this Agreement, the requisite applications and other necessary
instruments or documents requesting the FCC Consent (the " _FCC Applications_
") and thereupon prosecute the FCC Applications

   

40   

 

  

with all reasonable diligence to obtain the FCC Consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except as provided in the following sentence, neither the
Purchaser nor the Sellers shall be required (i) to pay consideration to any
third party to obtain FCC Consent or (ii) to accept any condition imposed by
the FCC that is reasonably likely to adversely affect, in any material
respect, such partys financial condition, assets, results of operations or
business, taken as a whole (other than any such condition attributable to the
Purchasers attributes or any act or omission of the Purchaser, which the
parties hereto agree the Purchaser shall be required to accept). The
Purchaser and NYTMS shall each bear one-half the cost of the FCC filing fees
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.  The Purchaser
and the Sellers each shall oppose any petitions to deny or other objections
filed with respect to the FCC Applications to the extent such petition or
objection relates to such party.  Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers shall
take any intentional action that would, or intentionally fail to take such
action the failure of which to take would, be materially inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement or reasonably be expected to have the effect of
materially delaying the receipt of the FCC Consent. Each party hereto
will promptly provide to the other parties a copy of any pleading, order or
other document served on or delivered to it relating to the FCC Applications.
Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions necessary or appropriate to be taken by such party (and
its Affiliates) to permit the FCC to issue the FCC Consent in a timely
manner.  Each party agrees to comply with any customary conditions imposed on
it (or its Affiliates) by the FCC Consent that are applicable to
broadcast television stations generally. If the Closing shall not have
occurred for any reason within the original effective period of the FCC
Consent, and neither party shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly request an extension
of the effective period of the FCC Consent. No extension of the FCC Consent
shall limit the right of either party to exercise its rights under Section
9.1. Within forty-five (45) days following the date hereof, the Sellers shall
make all filings with the FCC and Federal Aviation Administration as may be
necessary or prudent to resolve any discrepancies, to the Sellers Knowledge,
between an FCC License and its corresponding antenna structure registration,
including without limitation those discrepancies identified on _Schedule
4.15(g)_.

  

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that certain of the Stations are subject to
pending license renewal applications (" _Renewal Applications_ "). In order
to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Applications, the
Purchaser agrees, as a part of the FCC Applications, to request that the FCC
apply its policy permitting the assignment of FCC licenses in transactions
involving multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one
or more Renewal Applications. The Purchaser agrees to make
such representations and undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to
invoke such policy, including without limitation undertakings to assume the
position of the applicant with respect to any pending Renewal Applications
and to assume the risks relating to such Renewal Applications.  To the
extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant of a Renewal Application and/or
the FCC Applications, the Sellers shall enter into tolling agreements with
the FCC to extend the statute of limitations with respect to any pending
complaints against a Station filed with the FCC prior to grant of the FCC
Applications (to the extent that the FCC agrees to enter into a
tolling agreement with

     

   

respect to any such pending complaints). This Section 6.4(c) shall in no way
impair or affect any right the Purchaser may have under this Agreement with
respect to any matters arising in connection with the renewals that arose or
relate to any period prior to the Closing, including the Purchasers closing
conditions and indemnification rights.

  

(d) On or before the January 11, 2007 deadline for the filing of initial
comments in the FCCs Seventh Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
concerning a post-transition DTV Table of Allotments (or, in the event of an
extension of this deadline, such later date for filing initial comments in
that rulemaking proceeding as the FCC may specify), NYTMS shall file initial
comments in that rulemaking proceeding to request that the FCC modify the
proposed DTV allotment parameters for KAUT-DT to reflect KAUT-DTs current
facilities.

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers and the
Purchaser hereby agree to provide promptly to Governmental Authorities with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust laws all
information and documents requested by any such Governmental Authorities or
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to file any notification and report form and related
material required under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement. The
Sellers and the Purchaser shall each thereafter take all necessary steps to
complete as soon as practicable its compliance with any requests for
additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR
Act. The Purchaser and the Sellers hereby further agree to take all
commercially reasonable steps to (i) obtain any governmental clearances
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
respond to any government request for information. The Purchaser and the
Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority or any other Person (including a private party) with respect to
such partys attributes so as to enable the parties to expeditiously
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including consenting to any
divestiture or other structural or conduct relief in order to obtain
clearance from any Governmental Authority or to avoid litigation with any
other Person that could prevent the consummation of the transaction. At the
request of the other party, the Sellers, the Purchaser, and their respective
Affiliates shall be obligated to contest, administratively or in court, any
ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Authority or any other
Person respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall each bear one-half of the cost of the filing
fee required under the HSR Act.

  

(f) In connection with the efforts referenced in this Section 6.4 to obtain
(i) all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable antitrust laws and (ii)
the FCC Consent, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall each use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated
by a private party, (B) keep the other party informed in all material
respects of any material communication received by such party from, or given
by such

     

   

party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the FCC or any other
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, (C) permit the other party
the opportunity to review in advance any submissions to any Governmental
Authority or material agreement that relates to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (D) permit the other party to
attend any meetings with any Governmental Authority or participate in any
communications with any Governmental Authority.

  

(g) To the extent that the term of any agreements under which WideOrbit Inc.
licenses systems or software, or provides services to the Stations,
including, without limitation, the _WO Traffic_ and _WO Automation_
applications, expires prior to May 31, 2008, prior to Closing, the Sellers
will extend the term of such agreement(s) through May 31, 2008 on the same
terms and conditions as currently set forth in such agreements.

  

6.5 _Fulfillment of Conditions by the Sellers_.  Subject to the other terms,
limitations and qualifications set forth in this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not knowingly take or cause to be taken, or knowingly fail to take or cause
to be taken, any action that would cause the conditions to the obligations of
the Sellers or the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby to not be satisfied or fulfilled at or prior to the Closing.

  

6.6 _Fulfillment of Conditions by the Purchaser_.  Subject to the other
terms, limitations and qualifications set forth in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not knowingly take or cause to be taken, or knowingly fail to
take or cause to be taken, any action that would cause the conditions to the
obligations of the Sellers or the Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby to fail to be satisfied or fulfilled at or prior to
Closing.

  

6.7 _Publicity_. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each
other in the development and distribution of all news releases and other
public disclosures relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser shall issue or make,
or allow to have issued or made, any press release or public announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party hereto, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange, but in any event only
after giving the other parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on
such release or announcement in advance, consistent with such applicable
legal requirements.

  

6.8 _Transaction Costs_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay all transaction costs and expenses
(including legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses) that
it incurs in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the Sellers shall pay all transaction costs and expenses (including
legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses) that they incur
in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement

     

   

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser
and the Sellers shall each bear one-half of the cost of any and all transfer
Taxes (including sales, use and real property transfer Taxes) and the fees
and costs of recording or filing all applicable conveyancing instruments
associated with the transfer of the Station Assets from the Sellers to the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns
regarding any transfer Taxes which become payable as a result of the transfer
of the Station Assets from the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement or shall cooperate to seek an available exemption from such Taxes.
The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to prorate the liability and payment of
property Taxes accruing from the ownership of Station Assets based upon each
partys period of ownership during the applicable fiscal period of each
taxing jurisdictions assessment year (i.e _._ , the number of each partys
respective days of ownership divided by 365). The period of ownership for the
applicable fiscal period shall be determined on a daily basis. The Sellers
period of ownership shall begin with the first day of each taxing
jurisdictions assessment year and end with the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.  The Purchasers period of ownership shall commence with the
Closing Date and end on the last day of each taxing jurisdictions assessment
year.

  

6.9 _Employees and Employee Benefit Matters_.

  

(a) The Purchaser shall offer employment as of the Closing Date to
substantially all of the Business Employees employed at the Stations. In
determining which Business Employees will be offered employment, the
Purchaser will comply with all applicable Laws. Each such Business Employee
who accepts the Purchasers offer of employment as of the Closing Date (a "
_Transferred Employee_ ") shall be entitled to receive during his or her
employment with the Purchaser (provided that the Purchaser is not required to
employ any Transferred Employee for any minimum period of time after the
Closing Date): (i) until at least the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
(x) an annualized base salary or hourly rate of pay that is no less than that
paid by the Sellers (or any Affiliate thereof) to such Transferred Employee
as set forth on _Schedule 6.9(a)_ as of the date hereof, provided that
employees who receive base pay and bonus or commissions shall receive a
combination of base pay plus bonus or commission opportunity that is no less
than the rate of base pay and bonus or commission opportunity paid by the
Sellers (or any Affiliate thereof) to such Transferred Employees as set forth
on _Schedule 6.9(a)_ as of the date hereof, and (y) a position comparable to
the position such Transferred Employee held with the Sellers (or any
Affiliate thereof) as of the Closing Date at a work location that is not more
than 50 miles from the work location where such transferred Employee worked
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) sick and vacation leave, health
insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment
insurance, short-and-long-term disability insurance and 401(k) retirement
benefits on terms and conditions that are comparable in the aggregate to what
the Sellers provide. The Purchasers health, vacation, severance, sick leave
and other employee benefit plans and policies shall, to the extent permitted
under the applicable plans of the Purchaser, provide each Transferred
Employee with credit for years of service with the Sellers (or their
Affiliates) prior to the Closing, to the same extent the Sellers credited
such service prior to Closing, for the purpose of (w) eligibility, (x)
vesting, (y) seniority/benefit entitlement for sick and vacation leave, and

     

   

(z) until at least the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
seniority/benefit entitlement for severance benefits.

  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.9(a), at the request of the
Purchaser, the Sellers (and their Affiliates) shall assign to the Purchaser,
and the Purchaser shall assume, responsibility for all obligations,
contingent or otherwise, arising on or after the Closing Date under the
individual written employment agreements set forth in _Schedule 4.7(a)(iv)_
that are specifically identified by the Purchaser to the Sellers in a written
notice delivered by the Purchaser to the Sellers no fewer than thirty (30)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Employment Agreements_ ")
(but only to the extent such obligations are attributable to the period on or
after the Closing Date and are not attributable to the period prior to the
Closing Date) and otherwise shall offer employment consistent with the terms
of such written Employment Agreements. Without limiting the provisions of
Section 6.9(a), at the request of the Purchaser, the Sellers (and their
Affiliates) shall assign to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall assume,
responsibility for all obligations, contingent or otherwise, arising on or
after the Closing Date under such written independent contractor
agreements set forth in _Schedule 4.7(a)(iv)_ that are specifically
identified by the Purchaser to the Sellers in a written notice delivered by
the Purchaser to the Sellers no fewer than thirty (30) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date (the " _Independent Contractor Agreements_ ") (but only to
the extent such obligations are attributable to the period on or after the
Closing Date and are not attributable to the period prior to the Closing
Date). With respect to the incentive pay or bonus opportunity under any
Employment Agreement or Independent Contractor Agreement for a performance
period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall be liable to the Purchaser for a pro-rata portion of the
incentive pay and/or bonus which is attributable to the portion of the
performance period prior to Closing, and the Sellers shall reimburse
the Purchaser within 30 days after the Purchaser pays such compensation
and invoices the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers (and
their Affiliates) shall be exclusively responsible for any payments due under
such Employment Agreement or Independent Contractor Agreements (i) for
periods prior to the Closing, or (ii) as a result of the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether such payments are due as
of or any time on or after the Closing Date, except to the extent such
liabilities are taken into account in the determination of the Closing
Working Capital under this Agreement.  Other than with respect to the
Employment Agreements and Independent Contractor Agreements listed in
_Schedule 4.7(a)(iv)_ and with respect to which the Purchaser has given
written notice to the Sellers of its election to assume such Employment
Agreements and Independent Contractor Agreements, as provided in this Section
6.9(b), the Purchaser is not assuming any employment agreements or
independent contractor agreements of Sellers or their Affiliates.

  

(c) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall offer each
Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) coverage under a
group health plan that provides "health benefits" (within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) (but only to the extent
permitted under the applicable plans of the Purchaser): (i)
without limitation for pre-existing conditions (to the extent no such pre-
existing condition limitations applied under the group health plan in which
the

     

   

Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) participated
immediately prior to the Closing), and (ii) which for the year during which
the Closing occurs, provides such Transferred Employee full credit for any
deductible already incurred by the Transferred Employee (and his or her
dependents) under Sellers comparable group health plan and with any other
out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-of-pocket expense
provision of such group health plan (provided that the Sellers provide
appropriate documentation from the Sellers group health plans to confirm the
amount of such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid since the
beginning of the calendar year and such documentation is provided within
thirty (30) business days after the Closing Date).

  

(d) If, as of the Closing Date, any Transferred Employee is eligible to take
any accrued but unused vacation time (pursuant to the vacation policy
applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to Closing), the
Purchaser shall allow such Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation
prior to the end of the year that includes such Closing, to permit such
Transferred Employee to carry forward accrued and unused vacation to
subsequent years in accordance with the Purchasers vacation policy and, to
the extent the Purchasers vacation policy does not permit such accrued and
unused vacation to be carried forward, to provide pay in lieu of such leave,
and/or to receive payment thereafter upon termination of employment to the
extent such payment would have been made under the Sellers vacation policy.
 All accrued and unused vacation time as of the Adjustment Time shall
be included as a current liability in the Closing Working Capital.

  

(e) From and after the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, if the Purchaser terminates the employment of a Transferred
Employee without cause, then the Purchaser shall pay cash severance benefits
to such Transferred Employee in an amount equal to one week of base pay for
each six months of continuous service, with a maximum benefit of 26 weeks of
pay, provided the Transferred Employee signs a general release with respect
to his or her employment with the Purchaser and the Sellers and their
Affiliates. For purposes of determining the severance pay in the preceding
sentence, such Transferred Employee will receive credit for service performed
for the Sellers (or its Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date (to the same
extent that the Sellers credited such service), and service performed for the
Purchaser on or after the Closing Date.

  

(f) The Sellers and their Affiliates shall be responsible for providing
"continuation coverage," as such term is defined under Section 4980B of the
Internal Revenue Code (" _COBRA_ "), to any Business Employee (and his or her
dependents) for any qualified event that occurs on or prior to the Closing
Date, including as a result of the Sellers termination of employment of the
Business Employees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (regardless of whether the Purchaser offers employment to the
Business Employee or the Business Employee does not accept an offer of
employment).

  

(g) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have in effect a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans which include a qualified
cash or

     

   

deferred arrangement within the meaning of section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code (the " _Purchaser s 401(k) Plan_"). Immediately prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause all of the account balances of
the Transferred Employees under NYTs 401(k) Plan (the " _Sellers  401(k)
Plan_") to become fully vested. To the extent a Transferred Employee does
not exercise his or her right under Sellers 401(k) Plan to receive a
distribution from such plan on account of separation from employment, then as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause such
account balances to be transferred to the Purchasers 401(k) Plan, and the
Purchaser shall cause the Purchasers 401(k) Plan to accept such transfer.
Such transfer shall be made in cash or in kind, as mutually agreed by the
Purchaser and Sellers, provided that the portion of the transferred accounts
represented by participant loans shall be transferred in kind. Prior to
such transfer, the Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers, and the Sellers
shall provide to the Purchaser, such evidence or assurance as reasonably
requested by the Sellers and the Purchaser as to the tax-qualified status of
their respective 401(k) plans (including an IRS determination letter, a
submission therefor and/or an opinion of counsel).  The parties shall comply
with all provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA applicable to such
transfer, including sections 414(l) and 411(d)(6) of the Internal Revenue
Code and the corresponding provisions of ERISA. After such transfer of
assets, the Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify the
Sellers against, any subsequent change in the dollar value of the transferred
assets.

  

(h) Sellers shall retain responsibility for claims for workers compensation
or for the type of benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or
not covered by ERISA) that are incurred prior to the Closing Date by
Transferred Employees. The Purchaser shall be responsible for disability
benefits and workers compensation benefits for Transferred Employees for
claims incurred on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of the foregoing, a
medical or dental claim shall be considered incurred when the medical
services are rendered or medical supplies are provided, and not when the
condition arose. A disability or workers compensation claim shall be
considered incurred prior to the Closing Date if the injury or condition
giving rise to the claim occurs prior to the Closing Date.

  

(i) As of the Closing Date, Sellers and their Affiliates shall assign to the
Purchaser all of the restrictive covenants set forth in _Schedule 4.7(a)(v)_.
As of the Closing Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall cause to be
discharged and satisfied in full compensation owed to any of the Transferred
Employees for any periods prior to and including the Closing Date and amounts
owed to any of the Transferred Employees arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in the form of wages, commissions, salaries,
bonuses, sick pay, incentive pay, bonuses and any payments due on account of
termination of employment with any of Sellers or their Affiliates (if any),
provided that the Purchaser shall assume the liability of paying incentive
pay and/or bonuses pursuant to Section 6.9(b) and vacation benefits pursuant
to Section 6.9(d).

  

(j) The Purchaser and the Sellers shall discuss utilization of the "alternate
procedure" of Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 IRB 320 issued
by the IRS, pursuant to which the Purchaser may become responsible for all
employment tax reporting, including Forms W-2, with respect to all payments
made to

     

   

the Transferred Employees during the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs, including payments made by the Sellers.

  

(k) Neither the Sellers nor their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Business, or an individual
performing personal services relating to the Business as an independent
contractor, to leave the employ or engagement of the Business after the date
of this Agreement for the purpose of the Sellers or their Affiliates
continuing to employ or engage such individual on or after the Closing Date.
In addition, from and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not, directly
or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce to leave the employ of the
Purchaser (or its Affiliates) any Transferred Employee or any individual
performing personal services relating to the Business as an independent
contractor to the Business.  The non-interference covenant in the immediately
preceding sentence shall apply for a period of two years following the
Closing Date, _provided_  that it will not prohibit the Sellers and their
Affiliates from: (i) attempting to hire or hiring any Transferred Employee
after the involuntary termination of such employees employment by the
Purchaser; (ii) placing public advertisements or conducting any other form of
general solicitation that is not specifically targeted towards the
Transferred Employees; or (iii) soliciting specifically
identified Transferred Employees with the prior agreement of the Purchaser.

  

6.10 _Retention of and Access to Records_. From and after the Closing Date,
for a period of six (6) years the Purchaser shall preserve all books and
records transferred by the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon the expiration of such six (6) year period, the Purchaser
shall provide the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to obtain copies, at the
Sellers expense, of any of such books and records. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, the Purchaser, at the Sellers expense, shall deliver
to the Sellers such financial information relating to the Business and
transferred to the Purchaser as part of the Station Assets in sufficient
detail to enable the Sellers to prepare their financial statements and all
Tax Returns of the Sellers relating to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall afford to the Sellers, and its counsel, accountants and other
authorized agents and representatives, during normal business hours,
reasonable access to the employees, books, records and other data relating to
the Station Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Transferred Employees and
the Excluded Liabilities in its possession with respect to periods prior to
the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to the
extent that such access may be reasonably required by the requesting party
(a) to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final disposition of any
claims which may have been or may be made against any such party or Person,
or its Affiliates, (b) for the preparation of Tax Returns and audits, and (c)
for any other reasonable and proper business purpose, provided such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the business and operations of the Stations or
of the Purchaser.

  

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. In the event that any of the Sellers
becomes aware (which shall mean any Sellers actual knowledge), on or prior
to the Closing Date, of a breach in any material respect of any
representation or warranty of the Sellers due to facts or events occurring
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, the Sellers shall notify the
Purchaser in writing. Such notice shall include a statement by

     

   

the Sellers whether such breach, together with any other notices of breach
provided pursuant this Section 6.11, would cause the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(a) to not be satisfied.  If such breach of a representation and
warranty would entitle the Purchaser to not consummate the Closing, then the
Purchaser shall be entitled during the thirty (30) calendar day period after
the delivery to the Purchaser of such notice to terminate this Agreement
unless the Sellers undertake to cure such breach; _provided_ that if such
breach is not cured by the Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall not be required to consummate the Closing. If the Purchaser
does not terminate this Agreement within such thirty (30) calendar day
period, such breach will have been waived for purposes of Article VII
(Closing Conditions) and for purposes of Section 8.3(a)(i) (Indemnification
by Sellers for breach of representations and warranties). Without limiting
the Purchasers rights or the Sellers obligations set forth above, in the
event the Purchaser becomes aware (which shall mean the Purchasers
actual knowledge), on or prior to the Closing Date, of a breach in any
material respect of any representation or warranty of the Sellers due to
facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this Agreement,
which the Purchaser believes may cause the condition set forth in Section
7.1(a) to not be satisfied, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers thereof in
writing.

  

6.12 _Control Prior to Closing_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, for
the purposes of the Communications Act and any other applicable Law, this
Agreement, including the covenants in this Article VI, are not intended to,
and shall not be construed to, transfer control of the Business or to give
the Purchaser any right to, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or
direct, or attempt to control, supervise or direct, the programming,
operations or any other matter relating to the Stations and/or the Business
prior to the Closing Date, and the Sellers shall have complete control and
supervision of the programming, operations, policies and all other
matters relating to the Stations and/or the Business up to the time of the
Closing.

  

6.13 _Environmental Surveys_. The Purchaser shall have the option to obtain,
at the Purchasers expense, Phase I environmental audit reports (the " _Phase
I Reports_ ") regarding the Real Property. If requested by the Sellers, the
Purchaser shall provide copies of the Phase I Reports to the Sellers promptly
after they are completed. If, in the Purchasers reasonable judgment, with
the Sellers prior agreement (which shall not be unreasonably withheld),
Phase II environmental audit reports (" _Phase II Reports_ ") are necessary

expense, the Purchaser may obtain such Phase II Reports. If requested by the
Sellers, the Purchaser shall provide copies of the Phase II Reports to the
Sellers promptly after they are completed.

  

6.14 _Real Property Surveys and Title Commitments_.  The Purchaser shall
have the option to obtain at its own expense (i) commitments for owners and
lenders title insurance policies on the Owned Real Property and commitments
for lessees and lenders title insurance policies for all Leased Real
Property (collectively the " _Title Commitments_ "), and (ii) an ALTA survey
on each parcel of Real Property (the " _Surveys_ "). The Title Commitments
will evidence a commitment to issue an ALTA title insurance policy from
Stewart Title Guaranty Company or similar national title insurer selected by
the Purchaser, insuring good, marketable and indefeasible fee simple (or

     

   

leasehold, if applicable) title to each parcel of the Real
Property contemplated above for such amount as the Purchaser directs and will
contain no exceptions except for Permitted Encumbrances.  The Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate (provided that they shall not be required to incur any
cost, expense or other liability) with the Purchaser in obtaining such Title
Commitments and Surveys.  If the Title Commitments or Surveys reveal any lien
or encumbrance on the title other than Permitted Encumbrances, the Purchaser
shall notify the Sellers in writing of such objectionable matter as soon as
the Purchaser becomes aware that such matter is not a Permitted Encumbrance,
and the Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such
objectionable matter as required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

certificate in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and Sellers

Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (a) discuss, encourage, negotiate,
undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as
the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any
transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase
or disposition of any material amount of the Business, the Stations or the
Station Assets or any capital stock of a Seller other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), (b)
facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or
submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction,
(c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person, any information
concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of any Seller in
connection with an Acquisition Transaction, or (d) otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. The Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than the Purchaser) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction. The Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of
their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, release any third party from any

Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller is a party and which were entered into
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the
Business as of the dates thereof and for the periods indicated therein
(except, in the case of the First Quarter Interim Financial Statements and
the Second Quarter Interim Financial Statements, for year-end and audit
adjustments).

  

(e) Within forty-five (45) days (or sooner if available) after the end of
each month between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
deliver to the Purchaser such monthly financial and operating reports as are

the Additional Financial Statements.

  

6.18 _Cooperation with Financing_.

  

(a) The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain
the Commitment Letters in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, provided that the Purchaser may obtain, in lieu of the debt financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, debt financing from alternative
sources on comparable or more favorable terms to the Purchaser (as determined
in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser), and (ii) subject to the
simultaneous consummation of the Closing on the terms and conditions set
forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letters, consummate the Financing on terms and conditions in all material
respects consistent with the terms of the Commitment Letters (or, if the

preceding clause (i), on terms and conditions in all material respects
consistent with the terms of the commitment letters for such alternative debt
financing) or on other terms and with any such other parties as are
satisfactory to the Purchaser.

  

(b) The Sellers shall provide, and shall cause their Affiliates to provide,
reasonable assistance to the Purchasers efforts to obtain the funds
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, including provision of financial
statements for prior periods, facilitating customary due diligence and
arranging for members of the Stations management to meet with prospective
lenders in customary presentations or to participate in customary road shows,
in each case upon the Purchasers request with reasonable prior notice and at
the Purchasers sole cost and expense. At the Purchasers sole cost and
expense, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to instruct their respective accountants to
provide customary assistance in such financing. In the event such financing
includes an offering in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of
1933 of the debt securities of the Purchaser or its Affiliates, the Sellers
will, upon the Purchasers request with reasonable prior notice, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to instruct the Sellers accountants to
deliver to the Purchaser and its Affiliates and the underwriters in any such
offering a letter covering such matters as are reasonably requested by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates or such underwriters, as the case may be, and as
are customarily addressed in accountants "comfort letters," and to provide
such accountants consent to the references to them as experts and
the inclusion in any applicable filings of their auditors reports. The
Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the assistance provided by the Sellers, their
Affiliates, officers, employees and representatives are being provided at the
request of the Purchaser, and (ii) none of the Sellers shall have any
liability to lenders, prospective lenders or any other Person in connection
with the activities contemplated by this Section 6.18. The Sellers shall also
provide the Purchaser with reasonable assistance in gathering information
reasonably available to the Sellers relating to the past operations of the
Business and the Stations. The Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers and
their Affiliates for any and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates in connection with their assistance
provided to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.18.

     

   

6.19 _Transition Services Agreement_. Within thirty (30) days following the
date hereof, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with a list and
description of all services and other rights provided or licensed by or on
behalf of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates to a Station. Within sixty
(60) days of receipt by the Purchaser of such list but in no event fewer than
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser will notify the
Sellers which of such services and other rights the Purchaser desires that
the Stations continue to receive after Closing, and the Sellers, or their
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall provide, or cause to be provided, such
services and other rights (the " _Transition Services_ ") at cost, equal to
the amount of the corporate allocation that would have been charged to the
applicable Seller for the services so provided to the Purchaser consistent
with the Sellers practices for 2006, for a period of up to one (1) year
following the Closing, as requested by the Purchaser. The provision of
such Transition Services shall be subject to a separate, definitive
transition services agreement that the parties shall negotiate in good faith
and enter into at the Closing (" _Transition Services Agreement_ ").

  

6.20 _Non-Broadcast Licenses_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Non-
Broadcast FCC Licenses_ " shall mean the FCC Licenses other than the FCC
Licenses that are main station licenses issued under Part 73 of the rules and
regulations promulgated by the FCC, including business radio licenses and
satellite earth station licenses. If the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied, except that less than all of the FCC
Consents for the assignment of the Non-Broadcast FCC Licenses have
been obtained, then the Sellers and the Purchaser shall consummate the
Closing, excluding such Non-Broadcast FCC Licenses and any related assets
prohibited from being transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to applicable
Law, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Sellers.  The Sellers
and the Purchaser shall enter into a reasonable facilities sharing agreement,
consistent with applicable Law, to permit the Purchaser, at no cost to the
Purchaser, to communicate over the facilities covered by such Non-Broadcast
FCC Licenses until the FCC Consents for the assignment of such Non-Broadcast
FCC Licenses are obtained and such Non-Broadcast FCC Licenses have been
assigned. Within ten (10) Business Days after obtaining the FCC Consent for
the assignment of such Non-Broadcast FCC Licenses, the Sellers shall assign
and transfer such Non-Broadcast FCC Licenses to the Purchaser.

continue to survive (with respect to the subject matter of such written
notice only) until the applicable claim is finally resolved.  All covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement or instruments delivered pursuant
hereto shall survive until performed and discharged in full.

     

   

8.2 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser
agrees to indemnify the Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and representatives (each, a " _Seller
Indemnified Party_ ") against and hold them harmless from and reimburse them
for all losses, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees (collectively, " _Damages_ ") which such Seller Indemnified
Party may at any time sustain or incur as a result of or arising out of:

  

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained
herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(c)(i);

  

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained
herein; and

  

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities.

  

8.3 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. (a) After the Closing, the Sellers,
jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees and representatives (each, a
" _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ") against and hold them harmless from and
reimburse them for all Damages which such Purchaser Indemnified Party may at
any time sustain or incur as a result of or arising out of:

  

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Sellers contained
herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(i);

  

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers contained herein;
and

  

(iii) the Excluded Liabilities.

  

8.4 _Notification of Claims_.

  

(a) A party entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any claim
or demand which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (a " _Notice of
Claim_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a delay or failure to provide such
notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to
the extent that it has been prejudiced by such delay or failure.  Any Notice
of Claim shall (i) state (with reasonable specificity) the basis on which
indemnification is being asserted, (ii) set forth the amount of Damages for
which indemnification is being asserted, and (iii) in the case of third party
claims, be accompanied by copies of all relevant pleadings, demands and other
papers served on the Indemnified Party.

  

(b) If the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party of any claim or
demand pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3, as the case may be, asserted by a
third party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right (i) to employ
counsel of its choice to

     

   

defend any such claim or demand asserted against the Indemnified Party, (ii)
to control and conduct any proceedings or negotiations in connection
therewith and necessary or appropriate to defend the Indemnified Party and
(iii) to take all other steps or proceedings to settle or defend any such
claims, provided that in the case of any settlement that provides for any
relief other than the payment of monetary damages as to which the Indemnified
Party will be indemnified hereunder, such settlement may only be made with
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly as possible after its receipt of
the Notice of Claim (but in any case within 30 days of receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of a Notice of Claim (the " _Indemnity Notice Period_ "))
of its election to defend any such third party claim or demand. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party does assume the defense as provided above, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such defense
(including without limitation, with counsel of its choice), at its own
expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in connection with such participation. If the Indemnifying
Party does not deliver to the Indemnified Party written notice within the
Indemnity Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense
of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party
may defend against any such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, at the cost of the Indemnifying Party, provided that the
Indemnified Party shall not settle any such claim or litigation without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in such defense (including without limitation,
with counsel of its choice), at its own expense, and the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection with
such participation, and in all cases the Indemnified Party shall keep
the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed as to all matters concerning such
third party claim and shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of any and all significant developments relating thereto.

  

(c) In the event that a Notice of Claim hereunder does not involve a third
party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, within 30 days after the date of
receipt of a Notice of Claim, respond in writing to the Indemnified Party
(the " _Indemnity Response_ ") and set forth with reasonable specificity
those items, if any, in the Notice of Claim to which the Indemnifying Party
does not agree as well as the basis upon which such disagreement is founded.
Within 30 days following the receipt of the Indemnity Response by the
Indemnified Party, representatives of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall meet to attempt to resolve through good faith
negotiations the applicable disputed matters. The parties shall negotiate in
good faith for up to 30 days in an attempt to reach a settlement of any
disputed matter.

  

8.5 _Limitations_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnifying Party
shall have any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.3(a)(i), as the case may be, and no Indemnified Party
shall make a claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.3(a)(i), as the case
may be, unless the aggregate amount

     

   

of Damages sustained or incurred with respect to all claims pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.3(a)(i), as the case may be, exceeds 1% of the
Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ ") and then only to the extent of such
excess up to (but not in excess of) a maximum aggregate indemnity for such
Damages payable by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or the Sellers
pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i), as the case may be, of an amount equal to 10%
of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that:

  

(i) the Deductible shall not apply to claims for breach of representation or
warranty under Section 4.1 (Organization), Section 4.2 (Authority), the
second sentence of Section 4.5 (Equipment, Tangible Property, Condition of
Station Assets, solely with respect to title), the last sentence of Section

similar payment actually recovered by the Indemnified Parties from any third
party with respect thereto, (ii) any provision or reserve provided with
respect thereto taken into consideration in the determination of Closing
Working Capital, and (iii) any adjustments to the Purchase Price paid
pursuant to Section 2.3(b) in respect of the item in question.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser and
the Sellers acknowledge that the obligation of the Sellers and the Purchaser,
as the case may be, to provide indemnification for Damages arising out of
Section 8.2 or 8.3 extends only to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and that neither the Sellers
nor the Purchaser shall be obligated to provide such indemnification to any
other Persons.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any
claim for indemnification regarding any breach of any representation or
warranty under Section 4.17 or for any Excluded Liabilities relating to or
arising under Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials, the Sellers shall
have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnified
Party for any Damages that: (i) would not have arisen but for any intrusive
investigation (including any soil, groundwater

     

   

or surface water sampling) by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any of their
respective agents or representatives, except to the extent such intrusive
investigation was consented to by the Sellers pursuant to Section 6.13 or was
required by Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits or a Governmental
Authority; or (ii) exceed the cost to meet or impose the least stringent,
most cost-effective standard or remedy required by applicable Environmental
Laws which is consistent with the commercial or industrial use of the site as
of the Closing Date, as applicable (including any site-specific standards
based on risk assessments and any remedies or standards that require or are
limited to the imposition of institutional or engineering controls, deed
restrictions, land use restrictions or monitored natural attenuation).

  

8.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Benefits_. All payments made by the Sellers or
the Purchaser, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the other
pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and such agreed
treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

  

8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, from and after the Closing
with respect to Damages and any and all claims for any breach or liability
under this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements or otherwise relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Operative Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be solely in accordance
with, and limited by, the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser and the Sellers
hereby waive on their own behalf and on behalf of each other applicable
Indemnified Party, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any

Sellers or the Purchaser, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any
Federal, state or local law, rule or regulation (including (i) any such
rights, claims or causes of action arising under or based upon common law or
otherwise and (ii) any and all claims for Damages or contribution arising
under any Environmental Law); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding

Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) unless
the party seeking to so terminate this Agreement has complied with Section
6.4(b);

  

(d) by either the Sellers or the Purchaser, if the FCC denies the FCC
Applications with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and such denial has become a Final Order;

  

(e) (i) by the Sellers, if the Purchaser breaches or fails to perform in any
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of written
notice thereof to the Purchaser and (C) has not been waived by the Sellers,
and (ii) by the Purchaser, subject to Section 6.11, if Sellers breach or fail
to perform in any respect any of their representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform
(A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1,
(B) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days
following delivery of written notice thereof to the Sellers and (C) has not
been waived by the Purchaser; or

  

(f) by the Purchaser, as provided in Section 6.11.

  

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

(a) If (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(a) through (g) have been
satisfied, (ii) the Sellers have delivered to the Purchaser the certificates
contemplated by Section 3.2(b)(i) and (iii) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or (e), then in each such case the Sellers would
suffer direct and substantial damages, which damages cannot be determined
with reasonable certainty and, in order to compensate the Sellers for such
damages, the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to
$17,500,000, (the " _Liquidated Damages_ ") and such Liquidated Damages
shall, in the absence of fraud on the part of the Purchaser, be the Sellers
sole and exclusive remedy and shall be in lieu of any other remedies at law
or in equity to which the Sellers might otherwise be entitled. The payment
of the Liquidated Damages shall be made (x) within five (5) Business
Days following the date of such termination in the case of any such
termination by the Sellers or (y) prior to, and as a condition precedent to,
any such termination by the Purchaser. The Liquidated Damages shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Sellers and, if not timely paid as described in the immediately preceding
sentence, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate,"
as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect from time
to time or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law, calculated
daily on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed,
without compounding. The parties hereto acknowledge

   

60   

 

  

and agree that the Liquidated Damages, plus any interest accrued and payable
thereon, are to be paid by the Purchaser to compensate the Sellers for such
damages as liquidated damages, and that any and all amounts paid pursuant to
this Section 9.2(a) represent liquidated damages and not a penalty. Upon
payment of the Liquidated Damages as set forth above, this Agreement shall
become null and void and none of the parties hereto shall have any further
liability hereunder except that the provisions of Sections 6.3
(Confidentiality), 6.7 (Publicity) and 6.8 (Transaction Costs) and Articles
IX and X generally shall remain in full force and effect.

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, other than as
described in Section 9.2(a), this Agreement shall become null and void and
none of the parties hereto shall have any further liability hereunder except
that the provisions of Sections 6.3 (Confidentiality), 6.7 (Publicity) and
6.8 (Transaction Costs) and Article IX and X generally shall remain in
full force and effect.

  

9.3 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that,
except with respect to those instances in which the Sellers remedy would be
limited to the payment of Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section
9.2(a), money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by the other parties, that the parties hereto would suffer
irreparable harm as a result of any such breach, and that, in addition to all
other remedies available under this Agreement or at law or in equity, the
parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or
other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach,
without posting any bond, security or other undertaking. In the event of any
action by any party to enforce this Agreement, the other parties hereto
hereby waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

Any such notice or other communication will be deemed to have been given (i)
if personally delivered, when so delivered, against written receipt, (ii) if
sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service which guarantees
next day delivery, one (1) Business Day after being so sent, (iii) if given
by telecopier, once such notice or other communication is transmitted to the

communication is promptly thereafter delivered in accordance with the
provisions of clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) hereof, or (iv) if mailed by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and
addressed to the intended recipient as set forth above, five (5) Business
Days after being so mailed. Any notice, request, demand, claim or other
communication given hereunder using any other means (including ordinary mail
or electronic mail) shall not be deemed to have been duly given unless and
until such notice, request, demand, claim or other communication actually is
received by the individual for whom it is intended.

  

10.2 _Attorneys  Fees and Costs_. If attorneys fees or other costs
are incurred to secure performance of any obligations hereunder, or to
establish damages for the breach thereof or to obtain any other appropriate
relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense, the prevailing party will
be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in
connection therewith.

  

10.3 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any
purported assignment or delegation in violation hereof shall be null and void
except for assignments and transfers by operation of Law.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Purchaser may, without the consent of, but with prior
written notice to, the Sellers, assign all or a portion of the Purchasers
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Purchaser
falling within clause (i) of the definition of Affiliate; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the event of such assignment, the Purchaser shall remain
liable for all of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Purchaser shall be prohibited from assigning this

     

   

Agreement or all or a portion of the Purchasers rights and obligations
hereunder if such assignment would or would be reasonably likely to (i)
require any major amendment of the FCC Application once filed or (ii) result
in any material delay of the FCC Consent.

  

10.4 _Amendments and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except in writing signed by the party or parties against whom
enforcement is sought. The terms of this Agreement may be waived only by a
written instrument signed by the party or parties waiving compliance. No
waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute
a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise provided.  No
delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder. Whenever this Agreement requires or
permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in
writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of
compliance as set forth in this Section 10.4. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be the exclusive rights and remedies available to the parties
hereto at law or in equity.

  

10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the related documents contained
as Exhibits and Schedules hereto or expressly contemplated hereby (including
the Operative Agreements) contain the entire understanding of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior written or oral
and all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings relating to the
subject matter hereof. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are
hereby incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Agreement for
all purposes.  Disclosures included in any Schedule shall be considered
disclosures for all Schedules to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such
other Schedules. No investigation by or on behalf of the Purchaser shall
constitute a waiver as to enforcement of any representation, warranty or
condition contained herein, or a waiver as to any right of indemnification
hereunder.

  

10.6 _Representations and Warranties Exclusive_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and the Operative Agreements constitute all the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties hereto and their
respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors
(including financial, legal and accounting), agents and representatives and
upon which the parties have relied. In particular, and without in any way
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that, in making its decision to purchase the Station Assets, it is not
relying on (a) any information or materials, oral or written, distributed or
made available to the Purchaser by any Person prior to the date hereof
other than matters set forth in this Agreement, including the Schedules
and/or the Operative Agreements or (b) any financial projection, forecast or
business plan relating to the Business (other than, solely for purposes of
clause (vii) of Section 6.1(a), the Capital Expenditures Budget). With
respect to any projection, forecast or business plan delivered by or on
behalf of the Sellers to the Purchaser (other than,

     

   

solely for purposes of clause (vii) of Section 6.1(a), the Capital
Expenditures Budget), the Purchaser acknowledges that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts and
plans, (ii) it is familiar with such uncertainties, (iii) it is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all such projections, forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and (iv) it
shall have no claim of any kind whatsoever against any Person with respect
thereto.

  

10.7 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement is made for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors, executors and
permitted assigns, and nothing contained herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any third party beneficiary
right or any other legal or equitable rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement (except to the extent
that certain third parties are expressly covered by the indemnity herein).

  

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the substantive Laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to any conflicts of Law, rule or principle that might
require the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

  

10.9 _Neutral Construction_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
this Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms length and that
the final terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties
negotiations. Each party represents and warrants that it has sought and
received legal counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties
agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally
drafted by them, and that the provisions of this Agreement therefore should
not be construed against a party or parties on the grounds that the party or
parties drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision(s).

  

10.10 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions or
parts of a provision contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or part of a provision of this Agreement or any other jurisdiction,
but this Agreement shall be reformed and construed in any such jurisdiction
as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision or part of a
provision had never been contained herein and such provision or part shall be
reformed so that it would be valid, legal and enforceable to the
maximum extent permitted in such jurisdiction, _provided_ that any such
reform or construction does not affect the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner adverse to any party.

  

10.11 _Bulk Sales Laws_. The parties hereby waive compliance with the Bulk
Sales Laws of any State in which the Station Assets are located or in which
operations relating to the Business are conducted.

  

10.12 _Heading; Interpretation; Schedules and Exhibits_. The descriptive
headings of the several Articles and Sections of this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only

     

   

and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.  References to Sections or
Articles, unless otherwise indicated, are references to Sections and Articles
of this Agreement. The word "including" means including without limitation.
Words (including defined terms) in the singular shall be held to include the
plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to include the
other gender as the context requires. The terms "hereof," "herein" and
"herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated,
be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. It is understood and agreed that
neither the specifications of any dollar amount in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules or Exhibits is intended to
imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of such item in the
Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes
hereof.

  

10.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. EACH PARTY HERETO
CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED
WITHIN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES
THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY AGREEMENT
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY MAY BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY HERETO ACCEPTS FOR
ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES, GENERALLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE
OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT
RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY AGREEMENT DELIVERED
IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY
OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES
THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT
THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL IN ANY WAY BE
DEEMED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.

  

10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE

     

   

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.14.

  

10.15 _Guaranties_.

  

(a) The Purchaser Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the prompt payment of the Liquidated Damages if the conditions for
payment are satisfied pursuant to Section 9.2(a). The foregoing obligation
of the Purchaser Guarantor constitutes a continuing guarantee of payment and
is and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances,
including circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a guarantor.  The Sellers need not attempt to collect such
obligation guaranteed hereunder from the Purchaser prior to enforcing their
rights against the Purchaser Guarantor. The Purchaser Guarantor hereby
waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law) notice of
acceptance of this guaranty and notice of any liability to which it may
apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, suit or taking of other
action by the Sellers or any Affiliate thereof against, or any other notice
to, any party liable thereon (including the Purchaser).  Except with respect
to the payment of the Liquidated Damages, the Purchaser Guarantor is not
guaranteeing any other obligation, liability or agreement of Purchaser
hereunder.

  

(b) NYT absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the prompt
payment and performance of all covenants, obligations, liabilities and
agreements of the Sellers hereunder before and after Closing. The foregoing
obligation of NYT constitutes a continuing guarantee of payment
and performance, and is and shall be absolute and unconditional under any and
all circumstances, including circumstances which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor.  The Purchaser need not attempt
to collect any obligation guaranteed hereunder from the Sellers prior to
enforcing its rights against NYT. NYT hereby waives (to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law) notice of acceptance of this guaranty and
notice of any liability to which it may apply, and waives promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest, notice of dishonor or
nonpayment, suit or taking of other action by the Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof against, or any other notice to, any party liable thereon (including
any Sellers).

  

10.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be treated as original
signatures for all purposes hereunder.
