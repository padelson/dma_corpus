At the Effective Time, holders of Plaza Common Stock &#13;&#10;shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Plaza other than to receive the &#13;&#10;consideration provided for under this Article III. &#13;&#10;3.04 No Fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, &#13;&#10;neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of PPBI Common Stock shall be issued in the &#13;&#10;Merger.

Plaza shall give PPBI prompt notice upon receipt by Plaza of any such written demands &#13;&#10;for payment of the fair value of such shares of Plaza Common Stock and of withdrawals of such &#13;&#10;demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the DGCL.  If any holder of Dissenting &#13;&#10;Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (through failure to perfect or &#13;&#10;otherwise), the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis &#13;&#10;into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of &#13;&#10;this Agreement.

No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in &#13;&#10;this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than agreements or covenants contained &#13;&#10;herein that by their express terms are to be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination &#13;&#10;of this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections &#13;&#10;6.06(e), 8.02 and this Article IX, which shall survive any such termination).

Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement &#13;&#10;may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision or (ii) amended or modified at any time, &#13;&#10;by an agreement in writing among the parties hereto executed in the same manner as this &#13;&#10;Agreement, except that after the receipt of Shareholder Approval, no amendment shall be made &#13;&#10;which by law requires further approval by the shareholders of Plaza without obtaining such &#13;&#10;approval.  For purposes of clarification, an amendment of any date in Section 8.01(c) shall not &#13;&#10;require further approval by any shareholders and if such amendment were deemed by law to &#13;&#10;require further approval by the shareholders of Plaza, the receipt of the Shareholder Approval will &#13;&#10;be deemed to have granted Plaza the authority to amend such dates without such further approval. &#13;&#10;9.03 Counterparts.

The Shareholder warrants that these provisions will &#13;&#10;not unreasonably interfere with his or her ability to earn a living or to pursue his or her &#13;&#10;occupation and the Shareholder has the means to support himself or herself and his or her &#13;&#10;dependents and the provisions of this Section 6 will not impair such ability in any manner &#13;&#10;whatsoever.  &#13;&#10;(d) The Shareholder will not, at any time during the two-year period referred to &#13;&#10;in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement, disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of its &#13;&#10;Affiliates, or the business conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, or &#13;&#10;any stockholder, member, director, manager, officer, employee or agent of PPBI, its &#13;&#10;Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates. &#13;&#10;7. Specific Performance and Remedies.  Shareholder acknowledges that it will be &#13;&#10;impossible to measure in money the damage to PPBI if Shareholder fails to comply with the &#13;&#10;obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, PPBI will not &#13;&#10;have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other &#13;&#10;equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any &#13;&#10;such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that PPBI may have an &#13;&#10;adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive &#13;&#10;any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with PPBI&#8217;s seeking or &#13;&#10;obtaining such equitable relief.  &#13;&#10;8. Term of Agreement; Termination.  &#13;&#10;(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.  &#13;&#10;(b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date, if &#13;&#10;any, of termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (ii) the &#13;&#10;Effective Time of the Merger.  Upon such termination, no party shall have any further &#13;&#10;obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve &#13;&#10;any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. &#13;&#10;Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is terminated upon the &#13;&#10;Effective Time of the Merger, the provisions in Section 6 shall survive for a period of two &#13;&#10;(2) years from the Closing Date. &#13;&#10;9. Stop Transfer Order.  In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder hereby &#13;&#10;authorizes and instructs Plaza to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of Shareholder&#8217;s &#13;&#10;                                                 &#13;&#10;1 To be included in Shareholder Agreements signed by Carpenter board representatives. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>
