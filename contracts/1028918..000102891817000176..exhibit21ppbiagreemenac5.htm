PROCEDURES 3.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of a holder of shares of Plaza
Common Stock:  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5016.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 12 (a) PPBI Common Stock. Each share of PPBI Common Stock that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger. (b)
Plaza Common Stock. Subject to Sections 3.02, 3.04, 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07, each
share of Plaza Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange
for, the right to receive 0.2000 shares of PPBI Common Stock (the "Exchange
Ratio"). 3.02 Exchange Procedures. (a) Mailing of Transmittal Material.
Provided that Plaza has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the agent
designated by PPBI (who, if different than PPBI's or Plaza's then serving
registrar and transfer agent, is reasonably acceptable to Plaza) (the
"Exchange Agent") all information which is reasonably necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange
Agent shall, promptly following the Effective Date (but in no event more than
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Date), mail and otherwise make
available to each holder of record of Plaza Common Stock, a notice and a form
of letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to Plaza (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
such Certificate(s) theretofore representing shares of Plaza Common Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange
Agent or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent), advising such
holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering
to the Exchange Agent such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to
Section 3.01(b) hereof. A letter of transmittal will be properly completed
only if accompanied by Certificate or Certificates or instructions to
transfer Book-Entry Shares representing all shares of Plaza Common Stock
covered thereby, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section
3.02. (b) PPBI Deliveries. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, PPBI shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent certificates, or at PPBI's option, evidence of shares in book
entry form, representing the number of shares of PPBI Common Stock issuable
to the holders of Plaza Common Stock as the Merger Consideration, to be given
to the holders of Plaza Common Stock in exchange for their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares as provided for in this Article III. The Exchange Agent
shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the shares of PPBI Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account
of the Persons entitled thereto. (c) Exchange Agent Deliveries. (i) Each
holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates or Book- Entry Shares who
has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will,
upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to evidence of
issuance in book entry form, or upon written request of such holder, a
certificate or certificates representing, the number of whole shares of PPBI
Common Stock into which the aggregate number of shares of Plaza Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5017.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 13 surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement and any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to PPBI
Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case, without interest. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose consistent with the notice and form of letter of transmittal to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
(ii) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which prior to the
Effective Time represented Plaza Common Stock and which is not surrendered to
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein
shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of
PPBI Common Stock into which such Plaza Common Stock shall have been
converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the
records of Plaza of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Plaza Common Stock and, if such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to Plaza for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of
certificates for PPBI Common Stock as hereinabove provided. No dividends
which have been declared will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive
shares of PPBI Common Stock under Section 3.01 until such Person surrenders
the Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Plaza
Common Stock, at which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person,
without interest. (d) Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of PPBI
Common Stock in New Names. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to
deliver a certificate or certificates representing shares of PPBI Common
Stock to which a holder of Plaza Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as
a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or
Certificates representing the shares of Plaza Common Stock for exchange as
provided in this Section 3.02, or, in default thereof, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may
be reasonably required in each case by PPBI. If any certificates evidencing
shares of PPBI Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate evidencing Plaza Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by
an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of PPBI Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable. (e) Unclaimed Merger Consideration. The
exchange of shares of Plaza Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Section 3.02 shall be administered by the Exchange Agent
until such time as any unclaimed portion thereof is delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon the stock transfer books of Plaza to establish the identity of those
Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in this Agreement,
which books shall be conclusive (absent  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5018.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 14 manifest error) with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any
consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party
and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. 3.03 Rights
as Shareholders. At the Effective Time, holders of Plaza Common Stock shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Plaza other than to
receive the consideration provided for under this Article III. 3.04 No
Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of PPBI Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Plaza Common Stock who
otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of PPBI Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without
interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the PPBI Average
Share Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share. 3.05 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each outstanding share of Plaza Common Stock held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of approval of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Plaza Common
Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such
time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares of Plaza Common
Stock) shall not be converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Plaza Common
Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(b), without interest
thereon. Plaza shall give PPBI prompt notice upon receipt by Plaza of any such
written demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of Plaza Common
Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments provided
pursuant to the DGCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (through failure to perfect
or otherwise), the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be converted
on a share by share basis into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. Any payments
made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by PPBI or the Surviving
Corporation within the time period set forth in the DGCL. 3.06 Anti-Dilution
Provisions. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the shares of
PPBI Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be
declared with a record date within said period, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted accordingly; provided that a bona fide offering or sale of PPBI
Common Stock for fair value received shall not be deemed a reclassification,  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5019.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 15 recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment of the PPBI Common Stock. 3.07 Withholding Rights. PPBI
(through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Plaza Common Stock such amounts as PPBI determines is
required under the Code or any state, local or foreign Tax law or regulation
thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment,
and to collect any necessary Tax forms or other necessary information. In the
event PPBI reasonably determines that it is so required to deduct or withhold
an amount for or on account of any Tax from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, PPBI shall notify Plaza of
its determination and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize
to the extent permissible the amount of any such deduction or withholding,
including providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested
to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any deduction or withholding.
Any amounts so withheld shall be timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Plaza Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by PPBI. 3.08 Plaza Options,
Plaza Warrants and Plaza Restricted Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, each
Plaza Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a
single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Plaza Common Stock subject to such Plaza Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the PPBI Average Share
Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio over (B) the exercise price per share
of such Plaza Option (the "Option Merger Consideration"), less any applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise
price per share of any such Plaza Option is equal to or greater than the PPBI
Average Share Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, such Plaza Option shall
be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Plaza
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgment of
each holder of a then-outstanding Plaza Option with regard to the cancellation
of such Plaza Option and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Plaza Stock-Based Plans and all
Plaza Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time. (b)
At the Effective Time, each Plaza Warrant which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Plaza Common Stock subject to such
Plaza Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess,
if any, of (A) the PPBI Average Share Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
over (B) the exercise price per share of such Plaza Warrant (the "Warrant
Merger Consideration"), less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share of any such
Plaza Warrant is equal to or greater than the PPBI Average Share Price
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, such Plaza Warrant shall be canceled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Plaza shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgement of each holder
of a then-outstanding Plaza Warrant with regard to the  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5020.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 16 cancellation of such Plaza Warrant and the payment therefor
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each award of restricted
shares of Plaza Common Stock granted under a Plaza Stock-Based Plan (the
"Plaza Restricted Stock") shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof and consistent with the terms of the Plaza Stock-
Based Plan, accelerate in full and such Plaza Restricted Stock shall become
free of any restrictions and any repurchase right shall lapse, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive shares of PPBI Common Stock in accordance
with the Exchange Ratio (provided that any fractional shares of PPBI Common
Stock shall be treated as set forth in Section 3.04), less any applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting. 3.09 Reservation
of Shares. Prior to the Closing, the PPBI Board shall reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of PPBI Common Stock (i) for the purpose of
issuing its shares in exchange for shares of Plaza Common Stock in the Merger

Stock. ARTICLE IV ACTIONS PENDING ACQUISITION 4.01 Forbearances of Plaza.

(relative to Section 5.03(b) taken as a whole), and the representations of
Plaza contained in Section 5.03(m)(v), which shall be true in all material
respects, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of Sections 7.02(a)

representation or warranty for purposes of such Sections, as a consequence of
the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact,

which Plaza may have any liability including, without limitation, as a result
of being deemed a single employer with any entity under Section 4001(b)(1) of
ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"), are set
forth in Section 5.03(m)(i) of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule. True and complete

including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the
Health Care and Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, and with the
terms and provisions of all documents, contracts or agreements pursuant to
which such Benefit Plan is maintained. Each Benefit Plan which is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a
"Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received a favorable determination letter, or advisory or

any circumstances reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such
Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither Plaza nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any correspondence or written or verbal notice from
the IRS, DOL, any other Governmental Authority, any participant in or
beneficiary of, a Benefit Plan, or any agent representing any of the foregoing  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5035.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 31 that brings into question the qualification of any such
Benefit Plan. There is no pending or, to Plaza's Knowledge, threatened
proceeding, lawsuit or claim (other than a routine claim for benefits)
relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither Plaza nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to or could reasonably be likely to be subject to a material Tax,
fine, penalty or material liability of any kind under either the Code or
ERISA. No assets of Plaza or any Subsidiary are subject to an encumbrance or
lien that may be imposed under ERISA or the Code with respect to the
operation, administration or funding of any Benefit Plan. Since January 1,
2013, no Benefit Plan or related trust has been the subject of an audit,
investigation or examination or other proceeding by the IRS, the DOL or other
Governmental Authority. There have been no non-exempt "prohibited
transactions" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA and no breach of fiduciary duty has occurred with respect to any
Benefit Plan. With respect to each Benefit Plan, as applicable, all reports
and disclosures required to be filed or delivered under ERISA and the Code
have been accurate, have been filed or distributed in a timely manner, and
any Taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid. (iii) Neither
Plaza nor any entity considered to be a single employer with Plaza under
Section 3(37) or 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code ("ERISA

of ERISA, a multiple employer plan (as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code)
or multiemployer plan (as defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), a "voluntary
employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code, a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA" or a Retiree Welfare Plan, other than those disclosed
and identified as such in Section 5.03(m)(iii) of Plaza's Disclosure
Schedule. Except as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(iii) of Plaza's Disclosure
Schedule, no Benefit Plan holds as an asset an annuity contract, guaranteed
investment contract or other investment contract issued by an insurance
company. (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any
Benefit Plan (including any amounts withheld from employees' paychecks with
respect to a Benefit Plan) and premiums required to be paid have been timely
made or paid when due in accordance with the terms of the applicable Benefit
Plan and applicable law. All contributions for any period ending on or before
the Closing Date that are not yet due have been made or have been reflected
appropriately in the Plaza Financial Statements. Benefits under each Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA), with the exception of any flexible spending
arrangements subject to Sections 125 and 105 of the Code and health savings
accounts, are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies
issued by an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or similar
organization unrelated to Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries, the premiums for
which are paid directly by Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries, from its general
assets or partly from its general assets and partly from contributions by its
employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to a Benefit Plan requires
or permits a retroactive increase to premiums or payments due thereunder.

Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under,
any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in the payment of any "excess

the Code. No event in connection with a Plaza NQDP has occurred which would
subject a participant to inclusion of income under Section 409A(a)(1) of the
Code and neither Plaza nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability or is a
party with respect to any gross-up provision or agreement in connection with
any income inclusion, interest or additional Tax payable in accordance with

5.03(m)(viii) of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule and Section 6.11(d), each
Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without the consent of the
participants and without the imposition of any additional liability or

the books and records of Plaza and its Subsidiaries was made and has been
serviced in all material respects in accordance with Plaza Bank's lending

#52027286_v14 39 (s) Properties. To Plaza's Knowledge, all real and personal
property owned by Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries or presently used by any
of them in their respective business is in a good condition (ordinary wear
and tear excepted) and is sufficient to carry on their respective business in
the ordinary course of business consistent with their past practices. Plaza
has good, marketable and indefeasible title, free and clear of all Liens, to
all of the material properties and assets, real and personal, reflected on
the consolidated balance sheet of Plaza as of June 30, 2017 included in the
Plaza Financial Statements, or acquired after such date, other than properties
sold by Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business,
except (i) Liens for current taxes and assessments not yet due or payable for
which adequate reserves have been established, (ii) pledges to secure
deposits incurred in the ordinary course of its banking business consistent
with past practice, (iii) such imperfections of title, easements and
encumbrances, if any, as are not material in character, amount or extent,
(iv) as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of Plaza as of June 30,
2017 included in the Plaza Financial Statements and/or (v) as shown on the
title policies listed in Section 5.03(s) of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule. All
real and personal property which is material to Plaza's business on a
consolidated basis and leased or licensed by Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries
is held pursuant to leases or licenses which are valid obligations of Plaza or
any of its Subsidiaries and, to Plaza's Knowledge, are valid and binding
obligations of the other parties thereto, enforceable against Plaza or such
Subsidiary of Plaza, and to Plaza's Knowledge, the other parties thereto, in
accordance with their terms (in each case, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditor's rights or by general equity principles). Except as set
forth in Section 5.03(s) of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule, such leases will not
terminate or lapse prior to the Effective Time and Plaza and each of its
Subsidiaries has the right to use and occupy such leased real property for
the full term, and in accordance with the conditions of the lease relating
thereto. Neither Plaza nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of termination, cancellation, breach or default under any such real
property lease and, to the Knowledge of Plaza as of the date hereof, no event
has occurred, and no circumstances or condition exists, that (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to,
(A) result in a violation or breach of any of the provisions of any real
property lease, (B) give any Person the right to declare a default or
exercise any remedy under any real property lease, (C) give any Person the
right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any real property lease,
or (D) give any Person the right to cancel, terminate or modify any real
property lease. To Plaza's Knowledge, Plaza and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all applicable health and safety related requirements for the
real property owned by any of them, including those requirements under the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. (t) Intellectual
Property; Information Technology; Security. (i) Each of Plaza and its
Subsidiaries owns or possesses valid and binding licenses and other rights to
use all Intellectual Property used by Plaza and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of its business as currently conducted, and neither Plaza nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice of conflict or allegation of
invalidity with respect thereto that asserts the right of others. Plaza has
listed all registered Intellectual Property owned by Plaza and its
Subsidiaries, and all contracts to which Plaza and its Subsidiaries has
licensed Intellectual Property from third parties that is material to the
operation of Plaza and its Subsidiaries, in Section 5.03(t)(i) of Plaza's
Disclosure Schedule (other than commercially available "shrink wrap" or "click
wrap" licenses). Each of Plaza and its Subsidiaries owns or has a valid right
to use or license such  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5044.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 40 Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens (except
any restrictions set forth in any licensed Intellectual Property), and has
performed all the obligations required to be performed by it and is not in
default under any contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to
any of the foregoing. To Plaza's Knowledge, such Intellectual Property is
valid and enforceable. (ii) (A) Each of Plaza and its Subsidiaries owns or is
validly licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens, except),
all Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of its
business as currently conducted; (B) to Plaza's Knowledge, the use of any
Intellectual Property by Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries and the conduct of
their respective businesses as currently conducted does not infringe on or
otherwise violate the legal rights of any Person; (C) to Plaza's Knowledge,
no Person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of
Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by and/or licensed to Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries; and (D) neither
Plaza nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or
otherwise has Knowledge of any pending legal proceeding against Plaza or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property used by Plaza or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Intellectual Property owned by any Person, and
as of the date hereof, Plaza and its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or
events that would give rise to any legal proceeding against Plaza or any of
its Subsidiaries that is likely to succeed. (iii) To Plaza's Knowledge, all
information technology and computer systems (including software, information
technology and telecommunication hardware and other equipment) relating to
the transmission, storage, maintenance, organization, presentation,
generation, processing or analysis of data and information, whether or not in
electronic format, used in or necessary to the conduct of Plaza's and its
Subsidiaries respective businesses (collectively, "Plaza IT Systems") have
been properly maintained by technically competent personnel, in accordance
with standards set by the manufacturers or otherwise in accordance with
standards in the industry, to ensure proper operation, monitoring and use. The
Plaza IT Systems are in good working condition to effectively perform all
information technology operations necessary to conduct business as currently
conducted. Neither Plaza nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced within
the past three (3) years any material disruption to, or material interruption
in, its conduct of its business attributable to a defect, bug, breakdown or
other failure or deficiency of the Plaza IT Systems. Plaza and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable measures to provide for the
back-up and recovery of the data and information necessary to the conduct of
its business (including such data and information that is stored on magnetic
or optical media in the ordinary course) without material disruption to, or
material interruption in, the conduct of its business. Neither Plaza nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any Material Contract related to any
Plaza IT Systems. (u) Fiduciary Accounts. Plaza and each of its Subsidiaries
have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary,
including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee,
agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable laws and regulations. Neither Plaza nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to Plaza's Knowledge, any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any
fiduciary account and the records for each such fiduciary account are true and
correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5045.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 41 (v) Books and Records. The books and records of Plaza and
its Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in
material compliance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and
such books and records accurately reflect in all material respects all
dealings and transactions in respect of the business, assets, liabilities and
affairs of Plaza and its Subsidiaries. (w) Insurance. Section 5.03(w) of
Plaza's Disclosure Schedule lists and summarizes all of the insurance
policies, binders, or bonds currently maintained by Plaza and its
Subsidiaries ("Insurance Policies"), which summary includes for each Insurance
Policy, the name of the insurance carrier, annual premiums, and the amount of
coverage per event and, in the aggregate, a named insured (including any
additional insured that may be required), or otherwise the beneficiary of the
coverage. Plaza and each of its Subsidiaries is insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as are customary and prudent
in accordance with industry practices. All the Insurance Policies are in full
force and effect; neither Plaza nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
thereunder; no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration under such policies; all premiums due and payable with respect
to the Insurance Policies have been timely and fully paid; and all claims
thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. Except as set forth in
Section 5.03(w) of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim for coverage
by Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any Insurance Policies as
to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters
of such Insurance Policies or in respect of which such underwriters have
reserved their rights. Neither Plaza nor any of its Subsidiaries have received
written notice of any threatened termination of, material premium increase
with respect to, or material alteration of coverage under, any Insurance
Policies. (x) Allowance For Loan Losses. Plaza Bank's allowance for loan
losses is, and shall be as of the Effective Date, in compliance with Plaza
Bank's existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for
loan losses as well as the standards established by applicable Governmental
Authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board and is and shall be
adequate under all such standards. (y) Transactions With Affiliates. All
"covered transactions" between Plaza Bank and an "affiliate" within the
meaning of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act have been in
compliance with such provisions. (z) Required Vote; Antitakeover Provisions.
(i) The affirmative vote (or action by written consent) of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Plaza Common Stock entitled to vote (or
consent) is necessary to approve this Agreement and the Transaction on behalf
of Plaza (the "Shareholder Approval"). No other vote (or consent) of the
shareholders of Plaza is required by law, the Plaza Articles, the Plaza
Bylaws or otherwise to approve this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement and
the Transaction. The delivery of Plaza Shareholder Consents representing
greater than a majority of the outstanding Plaza Common Stock complies with
the Plaza Articles, the Plaza Bylaws and the DGCL, and will constitute the
Shareholder Approval required thereby.  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5046.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 42 (ii) Based on the representation and warranty of PPBI
contained in Section 5.04(l), no "control share acquisition," "business
combination moratorium," "fair price" or other form of antitakeover statute or
regulation under the CGCL or any applicable provisions of the takeover laws
of any other state (and any comparable provisions of the Plaza Articles and
Plaza Bylaws), apply or will apply to this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement or the Transaction. (aa) Fairness Opinion. The Plaza Board has
received the opinion of Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P., to the effect that
as of such date, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and
other matters stated therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the holders of
Plaza Common Stock from a financial point of view. (bb) Transactions in
Securities. (i) Since January 1, 2014, all offers and sales of Plaza Common
Stock by Plaza were at all relevant times exempt from, or complied with, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. (ii) Neither Plaza, none of
its Subsidiaries, nor, to Plaza's Knowledge, (A) any director or executive
officer of Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any Person related to any
such director or officer by blood, marriage or adoption and residing in the
same household and (C) any Person who has been knowingly provided material
nonpublic information by any one or more of these Persons, has purchased or
sold, or caused to be purchased or sold, any shares of Plaza Common Stock or
other securities issued by Plaza (1) during any period when Plaza was in
possession of material nonpublic information, or (2) in violation of any
applicable provision of federal or state securities laws, rules or
regulations. (cc) Registration Obligation. Neither Plaza nor any of its
Subsidiaries is under any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to register
any of their respective securities under the Securities Act. (dd)
Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in this Section
5.03, when considered as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements and information contained in this Section 5.03 not misleading.
(ee) No Additional Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties made by Plaza in this Section 5.03 and as Previously Disclosed,
neither Plaza nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Plaza, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and Plaza hereby expressly disclaims any such
other representations and warranties. 5.04 Representations and Warranties of

Approvals; No Defaults. (i) No consents or approvals of, or waivers by, or
notices to, or filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority or

timely manner and without the imposition of a condition, restriction or
requirement of the type described in Section 7.01(b). (ii) Subject to
receipt, or the making, of the consents, approvals, waivers and filings
referred to in the preceding paragraph and expiration of the related waiting
periods, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by PPBI
and the Bank Merger Agreement by Pacific Premier and the consummation of the
Transaction do not and will not (A) constitute a breach or violation of, or a
default under, or give rise to any Lien, any acceleration of remedies or any
right of termination under, any law, code, ordinance, rule or regulation or

agreement, indenture or instrument of PPBI or of any of its Subsidiaries or

#52027286_v14 45 (g) Financial Reports and Securities Documents; Material
Adverse Effect. (i) PPBI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

date filed or to be filed, (A) complied or will comply in all material
respects as to form with the applicable requirements under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be and (B) did not and will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except that information as of a later date shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date; and each of the consolidated statements of
financial condition contained in or incorporated by reference into any such
Securities Documents (including the related notes and schedules thereto)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position
of PPBI and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of operations and stockholders' equity and other comprehensive

during the periods involved, except in each case as may be noted therein.
(ii) Since June 30, 2017, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events
(described in any paragraph of this Section 5.04 or otherwise), is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to PPBI. (h) Legal
Proceedings. No litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding before any
court or governmental agency is pending against PPBI or its Subsidiaries and,
to PPBI's Knowledge, no such litigation, arbitration, claim or other
proceeding has been threatened and there are no facts which could reasonably
give rise to such litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding in any
such case that, individually or in the aggregate, has or could be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to PPBI. Neither PPBI
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is a party
to or subject to any order, judgment, decree or regulatory restrictions that,
individually or in the aggregate, has or could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to PPBI. (i) No Brokers. No action has
been taken by PPBI or its Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid
claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or
other like payment with respect to the Transaction, other than a fee payable
by PPBI to D.A. Davidson and Co.  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5050.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 46 (j) Regulatory Matters. (i) Since January 1, 2014, PPBI and
each of its Subsidiaries has duly filed with the appropriate bank regulatory
authorities in substantially correct form the monthly, quarterly and annual
reports required to be filed under applicable laws and regulations, and such
reports were in all material respects complete and accurate and in compliance
with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. In connection with
the most recent examination of PPBI and each of its Subsidiaries by the
appropriate regulatory authorities, neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries
was required to correct or change any action, procedure or proceeding which
PPBI believes in good faith has not now been corrected or changed, other than
corrections or changes which, if not made, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on PPBI. The most recent
regulatory rating given to Pacific Premier as to compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act is "satisfactory." To the Knowledge of PPBI, since
Pacific Premier's last regulatory examination of Community Reinvestment Act
compliance, Pacific Premier has not received any complaints as to Community
Reinvestment Act compliance. (ii) Neither PPBI nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of any of their respective properties is a party to or is subject to
any order, decree, directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding or
similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
extraordinary supervisory letter from, nor has PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of, any Governmental Authority. PPBI and its Subsidiaries have
paid all assessments made or imposed by any Governmental Authority. (iii)
Neither PPBI nor any its Subsidiaries has been advised by, and does not have
any Knowledge of facts which would reasonably be expected to give rise to an
advisory notice by, any Governmental Authority that such Governmental
Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, directive,
agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter
or similar submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure
or board resolution. (iv) (A) No Governmental Authority has initiated since
January 1, 2014 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to
PPBI's Knowledge, investigation or inquiry into the business, operations,
policies, practices or disclosures of PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Authority in the
ordinary course of the business of PPBI or the applicable Subsidiary), or, to
PPBI's Knowledge, threatened any of the foregoing, and (B) there is no
unresolved violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Governmental
Authority with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of PPBI or its Subsidiaries, except in each case
in subparagraphs (A) and (B), that did not have a Material Adverse Effect.
(v) PPBI and Pacific Premier are "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined
at 12 CFR §225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of its primary federal bank
regulator) and the rating of Pacific Premier under the CRA is no less than
"satisfactory." Neither PPBI nor Pacific Premier has received any
notification from a Governmental Authority that their status as "well-
capitalized" or "satisfactory" for CRA purposes will change within one year,
nor does PPBI have  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5051.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 47 Knowledge of any conditions or circumstances that would
result in a CRA rating of less than "satisfactory" or material criticism from
regulators with respect to discriminatory lending practices. (k) Compliance
With Laws. Each of PPBI and its Subsidiaries: (i) is, and at all times since
January 1, 2014 has been in material compliance with all applicable federal,
state, local and foreign statutes, laws, codes, regulations, ordinances,
rules, judgments, injunctions, orders, decrees or policies and/or guidelines
of a Governmental Authority applicable thereto or to the employees conducting
such businesses, including, without limitation, Section 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act and FRB regulations pursuant thereto, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the FRB, all other
applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices and Environmental Laws and all posted and internal
policies of PPBI and its Subsidiaries related to customer data, privacy and
security; (ii) has, and at all times since January 1, 2014 has had, all
permits, licenses, franchises, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and
has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental
Authorities (and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith) that are required in order to permit them to own or
lease their properties and to conduct their businesses as presently
conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and
approvals are in full force and effect and, to PPBI's Knowledge, no
suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened; and (iii) has
received no notification or communication from any Governmental Authority (A)
asserting that PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any
of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Authority
enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or

Plaza and PPBI further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to

fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to

additional information. 6.04 Regulatory Filings. (a) Each of PPBI and Plaza
and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings
and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all

shall use its best efforts to make any initial application filings with
Governmental Authorities within thirty (30) days of the date of this
Agreement or as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter. Each of PPBI
and Plaza shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5055.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 51 each case subject to applicable laws relating to the

respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transaction, and each party shall keep the other party
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
Transaction. Each party hereto further agrees to provide the other party with
a copy of all correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transaction, provided that PPBI shall not be required to
provide Plaza with confidential portions of any filing with a Governmental
Authority. In addition, Plaza shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure

prepare all documentation to effect all filings and to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the Transaction. To the extent not

press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of
the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
that PPBI or Plaza may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the circumstances),

advice of outside counsel, be required by law or the rules or regulations of
the SEC or Nasdaq. Plaza and PPBI shall cooperate to develop all public

interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, provided that
in any such event, Plaza will work in good faith with PPBI to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements. (b) During the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Plaza shall, upon the
request of PPBI, cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer
on a monthly or more frequent basis with representatives of PPBI regarding its

6.07 Acquisition Proposals. (a) Plaza agrees that it shall, and shall direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative retained by it) (all of the foregoing, collectively,
"Representatives") to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, including by requesting the other party to promptly
return or destroy any confidential information previously furnished by or on
behalf of Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder and by specifically
enforcing the terms thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. From the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, none of Plaza, its
Subsidiaries nor any of their Affiliates shall, and each of the foregoing
shall cause their respective directors, officers or employees or any
Representative retained by them not to, directly or indirectly through another
Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing

or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5058.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 54 terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
contractual "standstill" or similar obligations of any Person other than PPBI
or its Affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to approve or recommend,
or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or
propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, if the Plaza Board determines in good faith, after consulting with
its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would
breach, or would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, the Plaza
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law, Plaza may, in response to a
bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this
Section 6.07(a) that the Plaza Board determines in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (1) furnish information with respect to itself to any
Person making such a Superior Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
on terms that are in all material respects no less restrictive to such Person
than the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to PPBI (as
determined by Plaza after consultation with its outside counsel) (the
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), and (2) participate in discussions
or negotiations regarding such a Superior Proposal. Plaza agrees that it shall
concurrently provide to PPBI any information (whether such information is
confidential, nonpublic or otherwise) concerning Plaza or Plaza Bank that may
be provided to any other Person in connection with any Superior Proposal
which has not previously been provided to PPBI. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or
offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice or disclosure of an
intention to do any of the foregoing from any Person relating to any (w)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 10%
or more of the total revenues, net income, assets or deposits of Plaza and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of any class of Equity Securities representing 10% or more of the voting
power of Plaza or Plaza Bank, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of any
class of Equity Securities of Plaza or Plaza Bank or (z) merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Plaza or Plaza Bank, other than
the Transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant
to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of Plaza Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of Plaza's consolidated assets, which
the Plaza Board determines in good faith, after taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation), and after consulting with Plaza's
financial advisor (which shall be a recognized investment banking firm) and
outside counsel, (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on
the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required,
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Plaza Board, is
reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party. (b) Neither the Plaza
Board nor any committee thereof shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to PPBI, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to PPBI, the recommendation or
declaration of advisability by such  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5059.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 55 Plaza Board or any such committee of this Agreement or the
Merger in connection with the solicitation of Plaza Shareholder Consents or
otherwise (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such action being
referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) recommend,
declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare advisable the approval or
adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such
action, or adopt or approve any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) cause or
permit Plaza to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
(each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or resolve or agree to take any such
action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Shareholder
Approval, the Plaza Board may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
(y) in response to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f) to accept such Superior Proposal, in the case of each of
clauses (x) and (y), if the Plaza Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Plaza under
applicable law, provided that the Plaza Board may not effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
unless the Plaza Board shall have first provided written notice to PPBI (an
"Adverse Change Notice") at least three Business Days prior to such action
that it is prepared to take such action and, if such action is in response to
a Superior Proposal, the following additional conditions are satisfied: (A)
such notice shall attach the most current version of any written agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and (B)
PPBI does not make, within three Business Days after the receipt of such
notice, a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Plaza Board (after consultation with a financial advisor of national
reputation and outside legal counsel), cause the offer previously constituting
a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment or modification of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Adverse Change Notice and a new three Business
Day period). Plaza agrees that, during the three Business Day period prior to
its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or termination pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), Plaza and its officers, directors and representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with PPBI and its officers, directors and
representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by PPBI.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Plaza shall not be
entitled to enter into any agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this
Agreement has been terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 8.01, and
Plaza has paid to PPBI the Termination Fee. (c) In addition to the
obligations of Plaza set forth in this Section 6.07, Plaza shall promptly
(within 24 hours) advise PPBI orally and in writing of its receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal. (d) Plaza agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.07 by any Representative of Plaza or
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.07 by Plaza. (e)
The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.07 were violated by Plaza, its
Subsidiaries or any  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5060.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 56 Representative of Plaza or its Subsidiaries. It is
accordingly agreed that PPBI shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of Section 6.07 and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which PPBI is entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys' fees or
other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations
herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to
obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or
defense, PPBI shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs incurred therein. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
Plaza or the Plaza Board from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. 6.08 Certain Policies. Prior to
the Effective Date, upon the request of PPBI, Plaza shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and
regulations, use their commercially reasonable best efforts to modify or
change their Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of
PPBI; provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made
prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and
further provided that in any event, no such modification or change made by
Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of
previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of Plaza or its management with any such adjustments.
6.09 Nasdaq Listing. PPBI shall, as promptly as practicable, file all
documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq
the shares of PPBI Common Stock to be issued to the Plaza shareholders (i) as
the Merger Consideration in the Merger and (ii) to convert the Plaza
Restricted Stock into shares of PPBI Common Stock. 6.10 Indemnification.
(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, PPBI and the Surviving Corporation (each an "Indemnifying
Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer and employee of Plaza or a Plaza Subsidiary, as applicable,
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to
the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent

#52027286_v14 57 without limitation, matters related to the negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the
Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be
entitled under the Plaza Articles and the Plaza Bylaws or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in Section 6.10 of
Plaza's Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
PPBI shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as
incurred by such Indemnified Parties to the same extent as such persons are
entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Plaza
pursuant to the Plaza Articles and the Plaza Bylaws or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding which has been set forth in Section 6.10 of
Plaza's Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice
the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless the Indemnified Parties have conflicts of interest), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine by final, non-appealable written order that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations. (c) PPBI (and the Surviving
Corporation) shall maintain Plaza's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy (or provide a policy providing comparable coverage
and amounts on terms no less favorable to the persons currently covered by
Plaza's existing policy, including PPBI's existing policy if it meets the
foregoing standard) covering persons who are currently covered by such
insurance for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that in no event shall PPBI be obligated to expend, in order to
maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), an
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums paid by Plaza as of the date
hereof for such insurance ("Maximum Insurance Amount"); provided further,
that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure
such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Insurance Amount, PPBI shall
obtain the most advantageous coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Insurance Amount. PPBI shall provide proof of such coverage to
Plaza no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5062.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 58 (d) The obligations of PPBI and the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties
in a manner adverse to any Indemnified Party or any other Person entitled to
the benefits of this Section 6.10, or to whom this Section 6.10 applies,
without the written consent of the effected Indemnified Party or Parties
and/or such other Person, as the case may be. If PPBI or any of its
successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other
entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of PPBI shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.10. (e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and his or her representatives, as set forth in Section 9.07
herein, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise. 6.11 Benefit Plans. (a) As soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Time, PPBI shall transition Transferred
Employees of Plaza and its Subsidiaries from the Benefit Plans of Plaza and
its Subsidiaries to the corresponding PPBI Benefit Plans and take all
reasonable action so that Transferred Employees of Plaza and its Subsidiaries
shall be entitled to participate in each PPBI Benefit Plan of general
applicability to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of PPBI and
its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the Transferred
Employees of Plaza and its Subsidiaries in the PPBI Benefit Plans may occur
at different times with respect to different plans), provided that coverage
shall be continued under the corresponding Benefit Plans of Plaza and its
Subsidiaries until such Transferred Employees are permitted to participate in
the PPBI Benefit Plans and provided further, however, that nothing contained
herein shall require PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to
any former employee of Plaza and its Subsidiaries under any discretionary
equity compensation plan of PPBI. PPBI shall cause each PPBI Benefit Plan in
which employees of Plaza and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to
recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the
vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not for accrual of
pension benefits) under the PPBI Benefit Plans, the service of such
Transferred Employees with Plaza and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as
such service was credited for such purpose by Plaza and its Subsidiaries,
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the
extent not otherwise permissible under the terms of a PPBI Benefit Plan.
Nothing herein shall limit the ability of PPBI to amend or terminate any of
the PPBI Benefit Plans or the Plaza Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms at any time. (b) At and following the Effective Time, PPBI shall honor,
and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in
accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual
rights of, current and former employees of Plaza and its Subsidiaries and
current and former directors of Plaza and its Subsidiaries existing as of the
Effective Date, as well as all bonus, deferred compensation, supplemental
retirement plan, salary continuation, severance, termination, change in
control and other existing plans and policies of Plaza and its  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5063.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 59 Subsidiaries to the extent that each of the foregoing
(including amounts accrued or otherwise payable pursuant thereto) are
expressly set forth in Section 6.11(b) of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule. (c) In
the event PPBI transitions Transferred Employees of Plaza and its
Subsidiaries from the group medical, dental, health, life or disability plan
of Plaza and its Subsidiaries to the corresponding PPBI Benefit Plan at any
time prior to the end of the applicable plan year of the group medical,
dental, health, life or disability plan of Plaza and its Subsidiaries, at
such time as Transferred Employees of Plaza and its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental, health, life or disability plan
of PPBI or its Subsidiaries, PPBI shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of PPBI, (ii) provide
full credit under medical, health and dental plans for any deductibles, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees and
their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under a corresponding Plaza Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that such waiver shall not be
required to the extent that such waiver would result in a duplication of
benefits or to the extent not otherwise permissible under the terms of a
contract insuring benefits under the PPBI Benefit Plans. (d) Within sixty
(60) days from the date of this Agreement, PPBI shall identify the Employees
for whom PPBI agrees to continue employment following the Closing provided
they are employed by, and in good standing with, Plaza immediately prior to
the Closing (the "Transferred Employees"). On or before the Closing Date,
Plaza shall terminate the employment of those Employees who are not
Transferred Employees and shall pay any severance, retention, change in
control, accrued and unused paid time off, amounts payable pursuant to Section
3.08(a) hereof, or other similar payments, in each case, which have been
Previously Disclosed by Plaza to PPBI, obtain an executed general release of
claims that has not been revoked, and pay to the proper taxing authorities
any income and employment Tax withholding as well as the employer portions of
any applicable employment Taxes. PPBI shall remain responsible for payment to
any Transferred Employee of any severance or similar compensation and
benefits payable following a termination of employment. Those employees of
Plaza and its Subsidiaries who do not continue their employment with PPBI or
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, who are not a party to an
employment agreement or otherwise entitled to an existing severance package
and who sign and deliver a termination and release agreement (which will be
negotiated between PPBI and Plaza) within 30 days of the Effective Time,
shall be entitled to receive a single lump sum payment of severance in an
amount and in accordance with the terms of the Plaza severance policy which
has been set forth in Section 6.11 of Plaza's Disclosure Schedule, up to a
maximum of 12 weeks of salary. For purposes of the foregoing, any severance
benefits payable in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence
pursuant to timely delivered termination and release agreements shall be paid
on the later to occur of (i) the PPBI payroll date for the PPBI payroll period
during which the former employee delivers to the Surviving Corporation his or
her executed termination and release agreement, or (ii) the PPBI payroll date
for the PPBI payroll period during which the former employee's termination
and release agreement becomes effective following the expiration of any
revocation period afforded under applicable law. If Plaza or any of its
Subsidiaries has any other severance pay plan or arrangement, then any
amounts paid pursuant to that plan or  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5064.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 60 arrangement shall reduce the amount that the employee will
receive under this Section 6.11(d) and in no event shall there be any
duplication of severance pay. Nothing contained in this Section 6.11(d)
hereof shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way PPBI's
or its Subsidiaries at will employment policy or provide any third party
beneficiary rights to employees of Plaza or any of its Subsidiaries. In no
event shall severance pay be taken into account in determining the amount of
any other benefit (including but not limited to, an individual's benefit
under any retirement plan or policy). (e) Prior to the Closing, Plaza and its
Subsidiaries shall have paid into the Plaza Bank 401(k) Plan (the "Plaza
Retirement Plan") all employer contributions, including any employer matching
contributions, profit sharing contributions or other non-elective
contributions. Prior to the Closing, Plaza shall (i) adopt written
resolutions (or take such other necessary or appropriate action), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to PPBI, to terminate the Plaza Retirement
Plan in compliance with its terms and requirements of applicable law,
effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date and (ii)
provide for full vesting of all non- elective contributions under the Plaza
Retirement Plan for all participants who currently maintain an account under
the Plaza Retirement Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no
later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date. Plaza shall provide
PPBI with evidence of the termination of the Plaza Retirement Plan. (f) Each
of Plaza and PPBI acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained
within this Section 6.11 with respect to Employees are included for the sole
benefit of Plaza and nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.11. Nothing contained herein (i) shall be construed
to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement or
(ii) alter or limit the ability of PPBI to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program or arrangement at any time established, sponsored or
maintained by PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Plaza and PPBI agrees
that the terms of this Section 6.11 do not and shall not create any right in
any Person to continued employment with Plaza, PPBI or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or to any compensation or benefit. 6.12 Investor
Rights Agreement. PPBI and Carpenter shall enter into an Investor Rights
Agreement which shall address, among other things, (i) Carpenter's right to
designate one member to serve on the PPBI Board and the Pacific Premier Board
and to continue to serve in such capacity, subject to Carpenter satisfying
certain conditions, and (ii) PPBI's agreement to file a registration
statement to enable the funds managed by Carpenter to sell their shares of
PPBI Common Stock acquired in connection with the Merger and (iii)
Carpenter's agreement not to solicit the customers or employees of Plaza.
6.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Plaza and PPBI shall give prompt
written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a failure
of any of the conditions provided for in Article VII. 6.14 Estoppel Letters.
Plaza shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to
PPBI at the Closing with respect to the real estate (i) owned or leased by
Plaza or a Plaza

substantially the form of Annex F from all tenants and (ii) leased by Plaza

substantially the form of Annex G from its lessor. 6.15 Assumption of
Subordinated Notes Obligations. As of the Effective Time, PPBI shall have
assumed or caused one of its Subsidiaries to assume Plaza's Subordinated Notes
obligations. In connection therewith, PPBI and Plaza shall execute and deliver
any supplemental documents reasonably required pursuant to the term of the
Subordinated Notes to make such assumptions effective. 6.16 Antitakeover
Statutes. Each of PPBI and Plaza and their respective Boards of Directors
shall, if any state antitakeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable
to this Agreement and the Transaction, take all action reasonably necessary
to ensure that the Transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement and the Transaction. 6.17 Consents.
Plaza shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals, waivers, non-
objections and to deliver any notices required pursuant to the terms of the
Material Contracts as a result of the Transaction. 6.18 Exemption from
Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective Time, each of PPBI and
Plaza shall take all steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of Plaza Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of such shares of Plaza Common Stock in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 6.19 Consent
Decree. PPBI and Plaza shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to receive written confirmation from the DOJ prior to the Effective
Date that the Consent Decree will terminate at the Effective Time. Each of
PPBI and Plaza shall have the right to review in advance all information
submitted to the DOJ in connection with the Consent Decree or the termination
thereof, and each shall consult with the other with respect to its efforts to
receive such confirmation. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such
parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. ARTICLE VII

appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in

(other than agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express
terms are to be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of
this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
(other than Sections 6.06(e), 8.02 and this Article IX, which shall survive
any such termination). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, no representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to
deprive a party hereto or any of its affiliates of any defense at law or in
equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person,
including without limitation any shareholder or former shareholder. 9.02
Waiver; Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this
Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision or (ii)
amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing among the parties
hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except that after the
receipt of Shareholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by the shareholders of Plaza without obtaining such
approval. For purposes of clarification, an amendment of any date in Section
8.01(c) shall not require further approval by any shareholders and if such
amendment were deemed by law to require further approval by the shareholders
of Plaza, the receipt of the Shareholder Approval will be deemed to have
granted Plaza the authority to amend such dates without such further approval.
9.03 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be deemed to constitute one and the same original

rights to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other party's
fraud or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement. 9.06 Notices.

Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, the Investor Rights Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, the
Investor Rights Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement supersede any and
all other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except for the
Indemnified Parties' right to enforce PPBI's obligation under Section 6.10,
which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement. 9.08 Severability. Except to the extent that
application of this Section 9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Plaza or PPBI, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement. 9.09 Enforcement of the
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as
provided in Section 8.02(b), it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In the event attorneys' fees or other costs are incurred to secure
performance of any of the obligations herein provided for, or to establish
damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief,
whether by way of prosecution or defense, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein.

("PPBI"). All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below). WHEREAS, Plaza
Bancorp, a Delaware corporation ("Plaza"), and PPBI are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger
Agreement"), pursuant to which Plaza will merge with and into PPBI on the
terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection
therewith, outstanding shares of Plaza Common Stock will be converted into
shares of PPBI Common Stock in the manner set forth therein; and WHEREAS, the
Manager is the general partner of Carpenter Community BancFund, L.P.,
Carpenter Community BancFund-A, L.P. and Carpenter Community BancFund-CA, L.P.
(collectively, the "Investors"), which own the shares of Plaza Common Stock
identified on Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of
Plaza Common Stock subsequently acquired by the Investors during the term of
this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and WHEREAS, in order to
induce PPBI to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Manager has agreed to
enter into and perform this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1\. Agreement to Vote
Shares. The Manager agrees that while this Agreement is in effect, at such
time as Plaza conducts the Plaza Consent Solicitation, the Manager shall
deliver, on behalf of the Investors, a duly executed copy of the written
consent set forth as Exhibit II to this Agreement (or cause such consent to
be delivered) covering all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or
hereafter) that are beneficially owned by the Investors or as to which the
Manager or the Investors have, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or
direct the voting. 2\. Transfer of Shares. (a) Prohibition on Transfers of
Shares; Other Actions. The Manager hereby agrees, for itself and on behalf of
the Investors, that while this Agreement is in effect, the Manager shall not,
without the prior written approval of PPBI, (i) sell, transfer, pledge,
encumber, distribute by gift or donation, or otherwise dispose of any of the
Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Shares) or any interest therein, whether by actual disposition, physical
settlement or effective economic disposition through hedging transactions,
derivative instruments or other means, except for charitable gifts or
donations where the recipient enters into a voting agreement binding the
recipient to vote its shares in the manner provided in Section 1 of this
Agreement, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
any Person, or take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or
could reasonably be expected to violate or conflict with the Manager's
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5076.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 A-2 Agreement, or (iii) take any other action that could
reasonably be expected to impair or otherwise adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Manager's power, authority and ability to comply with
and perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement; provided,
however, that the prohibitions provided for in this Section 2 shall no longer
apply to the Manager or the Investors once Shareholder Approval is obtained
by delivery to Plaza and PPBI of the Plaza Shareholder Consents. (b)
Transfer of Voting Rights. The Manager hereby agrees, for itself and on
behalf of the Investors, that the Manager shall not deposit any Shares in a
voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into any voting agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement with respect to any of the Shares. 3\.
Representations and Warranties of the Manager. The Manager represents and
warrants to and agrees with PPBI as follows: (a) Capacity. The Manager has
all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement. (b) Binding Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Manager and constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Manager, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles. (c) Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Manager does not, and the performance by the Manager of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Manager of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which the Manager or the
Investors are a party or by which the Manager or the Investors are bound, or
any statute, rule or regulation to which the Manager or the Investors are
subject or any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of the Manager
or the Investors. (d) Ownership. The Shares are, and, except as otherwise
provided for in Section 2(a) hereof, through the term of this Agreement will
be, owned beneficially and of record solely by the Manager and the Investors,
except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. The Investors have title
to the Shares, free and clear of any lien, pledge, mortgage, security
interest or other encumbrance, except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit I
hereto. As of the date hereof, the Shares identified on Exhibit I hereto
constitute all of the shares of Plaza Common Stock owned beneficially or of
record by the Investors. The Manager has and, except as otherwise provided
for in Section 2(a) above, will have at all times during the term of this
Agreement (i) sole voting power and sole power to issue instructions with
respect to the matters set forth in Section 1 hereof, (ii) sole power of
disposition and (iii) sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in
this Agreement, in each case with respect to all of the Shares owned by the
Investors on the date of this Agreement and all of the Shares hereafter
acquired by the Investors and owned beneficially or of record by them during
the term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"beneficial  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5077.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 A-3 ownership" shall be interpreted in accordance with Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act, provided that a Person shall be deemed to
beneficially own any securities which may be acquired by such Person pursuant
to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of
conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise
(irrespective of whether the right to acquire such securities is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time, including the passage of time
within 60 days, the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any
event or any combination of the foregoing). (e) Consents and Approvals. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Manager does not, and the
performance by the Manager of its obligations under this Agreement and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, require
the Manager to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to
make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority. (f)
Absence of Litigation. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Manager, threatened against or affecting
the Manager or the Investors or any of their affiliates before or by any
Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to materially impair
the ability of the Manager to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis. 4\. No
Solicitation. The Manager hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement
it shall not, and shall not permit any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it to, directly or
indirectly, (a) take any of the actions specified in clauses (i)-(vi) of
Section 6.07(a) of the Merger Agreement, (b) agree to release, or release, any
Person from any obligation under any existing standstill agreement or
arrangement relating to Plaza, or (c) participate in, directly or indirectly,
a "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the
SEC) or powers of attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or
influence any Person with respect to the voting of, any shares of Plaza Common
Stock in connection with any vote or other action on any matter of a type
described in Section 1, other than to recommend that shareholders of Plaza
deliver written consents in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger and as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement. The Manager agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than PPBI with respect to any possible
Acquisition Proposal and will take all necessary steps to inform any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it of the obligations undertaken by the Manager
pursuant to this Section 4. 5\. Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding
Prohibited Transactions. The Manager hereby agrees to notify PPBI promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of
any additional shares of Plaza Common Stock or other securities of Plaza of
which the Manager or the Investors acquire beneficial or record ownership on
or after the date hereof. The Manager will comply with the provisions of
Section 6.07(c) of the Merger Agreement as if it were Plaza. 6\. Specific
Performance and Remedies. The Manager acknowledges that it will be impossible
to measure in money the damage to PPBI if it fails to comply with the
obligations  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5078.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 A-4 imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any
such failure, PPBI will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the
Manager agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition
to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such
failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
PPBI may have an adequate remedy at law. The Manager agrees that it will not
seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a
bond in connection with PPBI's seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.
7\. Term of Agreement; Termination. (a) The term of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof. (b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the date, if any, of termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (ii) the Effective Time of the
Merger. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve
any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination. 8\. Stop Transfer Order. In furtherance of this Agreement,
the Manager hereby authorizes and instructs Plaza to enter a stop transfer
order with respect to all of the Shares for the period from the date hereof
through the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7,
except as otherwise provided for in Section 2(a) hereof. 9\. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified,
and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument
in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by
any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such
party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any
provision hereof by such party. 10\. Notices. All notices, requests, claims,
demands or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given when delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission
confirmation if sent by telecopy or like transmission and on the next Business

Shareholder agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing

general solicitations through newspapers or other media of general
circulation, or the engagement of professional search firms, not targeted at
such employees) any employees of Plaza or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing ("Plaza Employees"); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to any Plaza Employee (Y) who does not become an employee of PPBI or
any of its Subsidiaries or is terminated by PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries
without cause on or after the Closing Date; or (Z) whose employment
terminated more than six months prior to the time that such Plaza Employee is
first solicited for employment following the Closing Date; or (ii) knowingly
(A) induce, persuade, encourage or influence or attempt to induce, persuade,
encourage or influence any Person having a business relationship with Plaza
or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, to discontinue,
reduce or restrict such relationship with PPBI or its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date, provided that nothing herein shall prevent Shareholder from
conducting or engaging in business with any Person who was not solicited in
violation of Section 6(a)(ii)(B), or (B) solicit or target the deposits, loans
or other products and services from or to Persons who were depositors,
borrowers or customers of Plaza or its Subsidiaries on the date of this
Agreement, and/or as of the Closing Date, whether by personal contact, by
telephone, by facsimile, by mail or other form of solicitation or
communication, or in any other way except for general solicitations that are
directed to the general public and not directed specifically to Persons who
were depositors, borrowers or customers of Plaza or its Subsidiaries on the
date of this Agreement, or as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for purposes of clarity, nothing herein shall prohibit the
Shareholder from exercising Shareholder's discretion relating to
Shareholder's personal and business banking relationships. (b) The
Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by Plaza and
its Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants made by the
Shareholder in this Section 6 are made as a necessary inducement for PPBI to
enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of this Section 6 shall be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is expressly understood and
agreed that although the Shareholder and PPBI each consider the restrictions
contained in this Section 6 to be reasonable, if a final determination is
made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or
territory or any other restriction contained in this Section 6 is
unenforceable against any party, the provisions of this Section 6 shall be
deemed amended  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5090.jpg) 

#52027286_v14 B-5 to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such
maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable. [Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6 shall not apply to any affiliate,
representative, client or portfolio company of Shareholder.]1 (c) The
Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement are
necessary to protect PPBI's legitimate business interests and to protect the
value of PPBI's acquisition of Plaza. The Shareholder warrants that these
provisions will not unreasonably interfere with his or her ability to earn a
living or to pursue his or her occupation and the Shareholder has the means
to support himself or herself and his or her dependents and the provisions of
this Section 6 will not impair such ability in any manner whatsoever. (d)
The Shareholder will not, at any time during the two-year period referred to
in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement, disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any
of its Affiliates, or the business conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any
of their Affiliates, or any stockholder, member, director, manager, officer,
employee or agent of PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates. 7\.
Specific Performance and Remedies. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be
impossible to measure in money the damage to PPBI if Shareholder fails to
comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event
of any such failure, PPBI will not have an adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate
remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief
on the basis that PPBI may have an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees
that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with PPBI's seeking or obtaining
such equitable relief. 8\. Term of Agreement; Termination. (a) The term of
this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. (b) This Agreement shall
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date, if any, of termination
of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (ii) the Effective
Time of the Merger. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further
obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination
shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event this Agreement is terminated upon the Effective Time of the Merger, the
provisions in Section 6 shall survive for a period of two (2) years from the
Closing Date. 9\. Stop Transfer Order. In furtherance of this Agreement,
Shareholder hereby authorizes and instructs Plaza to enter a stop transfer
order with respect to all of Shareholder's 1 To be included in Shareholder

hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions
hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed

any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such
party. 11\. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when

Community BancFund-CA, L.P. c/o Carpenter Fund Manager GP, LLC 5 Park Plaza
Suite 950 Irvine, CA 92614 Re: Investor Rights Agreement Gentlemen: This
letter will confirm our agreement with Carpenter Fund Manager GP, LLC (the
"Manager"), on behalf of, and as general partner of, each of Carpenter
Community BancFund, L.P., Carpenter Community BancFund-A, L.P. and Carpenter
Community BancFund-CA, L.P. (collectively, the "Investors"), that pursuant to
and effective as of the consummation of the merger (the "Merger") of Plaza
Bancorp ("Plaza") with and into Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. ("PPBI"),
pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of
August 8, 2017, by and between Plaza and PPBI (the "Merger Agreement"), the
Manager, on behalf of the Investors, shall be entitled to the following
rights, in addition to any rights specifically provided to all shareholders
of PPBI. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 1\. Board Representation. (i) The
Manager has identified James B. Jones to PPBI and Pacific Premier Bank
("Pacific Premier") or, if Mr. Jones is unable to serve, the Manager will
identify another individual mutually acceptable to the Manager and PPBI (the
"Manager Nominee") to potentially serve on the Board of Directors of PPBI
(the "PPBI Board") and the Board of Directors of Pacific Premier Bank (the
"Pacific Premier Board"). If requested by the Manager prior to the
effectiveness of the Merger, PPBI and Pacific Premier Bank agree that, upon
such effectiveness, each will appoint such Manager Nominee to the PPBI Board
and to the Pacific Premier Board, subject to: (a) such Manager Nominee being
qualified to serve as a member of the PPBI Board and the Pacific Premier
Board under all applicable corporate governance policies or guidelines of PPBI
and Pacific Premier, and applicable legal, regulatory and stock market
requirements, (b) the reasonable  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5106.jpg) 

E-2 #52027286_v14 approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee of the PPBI Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and (c) the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals. (ii)
From and after the Merger, and for so long as the Investors' beneficial
ownership (as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the issued and outstanding shares of the
common stock of PPBI ("Investors' Beneficial Ownership") is equal to 9.90% or
more, PPBI will take all lawful action to, if requested by the Manager, (i)
elect the Manager Nominee to the Pacific Premier Board and (ii) nominate and
recommend to its shareholders the Manager Nominee for election to the PPBI
Board at PPBI's annual meeting of shareholders. If so requested by the
Manager, PPBI shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Manager
Nominee to be elected as a director of PPBI, and PPBI shall solicit proxies
for such person to the same extent as it does for any of its other nominees to
the PPBI Board. The Manager shall notify PPBI of any proposed Manager Nominee
to the PPBI Board, in writing, no later than the latest date on which
shareholders of PPBI may make nominations to the PPBI Board in accordance
with the bylaws of PPBI, together with all information concerning such
nominee reasonably requested by PPBI, so that PPBI can comply with applicable
disclosure rules (the "Nominee Disclosure Information"); provided that in the
event the Manager fails to provide any such notice, the Manager Nominee shall
be the person then serving as the Manager Nominee as long as the Manager
provides the Nominee Disclosure Information to PPBI promptly upon request by
PPBI. (iii) If the Manager Nominee ceases to serve as a director of the PPBI
Board and/or the Pacific Premier Board for any reason (other than due to the
fact that the Investors' Beneficial Ownership falls below the threshold set
forth in this letter agreement), PPBI shall, if so requested by the Manager,
use its reasonable best efforts to take all action required to fill the
vacancy or vacancies created thereby with an individual designated by the
Manager (a "Manager Successor Designee") to serve in place of such Manager
Nominee for the remainder of the term that the Manager Nominee who is being
replaced would have served if he or she had not been replaced, subject to
such Manager Successor Designee being reasonably acceptable to PPBI and
qualified to serve as a member of the PPBI Board and the Pacific Premier Board
under all applicable corporate governance policies or guidelines of PPBI and
Pacific Premier and applicable legal, regulatory and stock market
requirements. During any period when a Manager Nominee is not serving on the
PPBI Board or Pacific Premier Board but the Manager is entitled to have board
representation hereunder, the Manager shall be entitled to receive all
materials distributed for or at all meetings (telephonic or otherwise) of the
PPBI Board and the Pacific Premier Board and their respective committees,
except for any documents subject to an attorney-client or attorney- client
work product privilege. (iv) Subject to subsection 1(v) below, if a Manager
Nominee is nominated by PPBI but not elected to the PPBI Board, PPBI shall,
if so requested by the Manager, immediately increase the size of the PPBI
Board and appoint an individual designated by the Manager and reasonably
acceptable to PPBI (such individual to be different from the individual who
was not elected by the shareholders of PPBI) to the PPBI Board. (v) Anything
to the contrary provided in this Section 1 notwithstanding, no increase in
the size of the PPBI Board shall be required by this Section 1 if it would
cause the size  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5107.jpg) 

E-3 #52027286_v14 of the PPBI Board to exceed the maximum size permitted
under PPBI's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporations ("Certificate
of Incorporation") or Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"); provided that
PPBI shall use its reasonable best efforts to amend such Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws to increase the number of directorships necessary to
appoint the individual designated by the Manager, including, without
limitation, submitting a shareholder proposal to amend the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws to increase the number of seats submitted to a vote
of shareholders at PPBI's next annual meeting of shareholders. (vi) At such
time as the Investors' Beneficial Ownership is less than 9.90% the Manager
will have no further rights under this letter agreement, and at the written
request of the PPBI Board, the Manager shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Manager Nominee to resign from the PPBI Board as promptly as
possible thereafter, and at the written request of the Pacific Premier Board,
the Manager shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Manager
Nominee to resign from the Pacific Premier Board as promptly as possible
thereafter. 2\. Resale Registration Statement. (i) PPBI agrees to cause to
be included in the Registration Statement for registration for resale those
shares of PPBI Common Stock to be issued to the Investors as Merger
Consideration (such shares, together with any shares issued or issuable upon
any stock split, distribution, recapitalization or similar event, the
"Registrable Securities"). PPBI further agrees to maintain the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement and cause the Registration Statement and any
related prospectus or prospectus supplement to be appropriately updated as
described in paragraph (v) below until the Registrable Securities may be
freely traded without a prospectus pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act
or otherwise (such period of time, the "Effectiveness Period"). (ii) Each
Investor shall prepare and furnish such information relating to it and its
Affiliates as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation of
the Registration Statement, and the Investors and their legal advisors shall
have the right to review the Registration Statement prior to its filing.
(iii) Each Investor agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading. Each Investor further agrees that if
it shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of any information
furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Registration
Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
false or misleading, to promptly inform PPBI thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement. (iv) PPBI agrees to
advise the Investors, promptly after PPBI receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension
of the qualification of PPBI Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent  

  

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5108.jpg) 

E-4 #52027286_v14 PPBI is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any
such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of
the Registration Statement or for additional information. (v) In connection
with PPBI's registration obligations hereunder, PPBI shall: (a) (1) prepare
and file with the SEC such amendments, including post- effective amendments,
to such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration
Statement continuously effective as to the Registrable Securities for the
Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the SEC such additional
Registration Statements as necessary in order to register for resale under
the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities and (2) cause the related
prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required prospectus
supplement, and as so supplemented or amended to be filed pursuant to Rule
424 (or any similar provisions then in force) promulgated under the
Securities Act, in each of the cases of clauses (1) and (2) so that the
Registration Statement and prospectus or prospectus supplement may be used
continuously by the Members to sell the Registrable Securities throughout the
Effectiveness Period; (b) cooperate with the Investors so that the shares of
Registrable Securities are DTC-eligible from and after the time that the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; and (c) make all
required periodic filings with the SEC such that, following the time at which
the Registrable Securities become eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144 of
the Securities Act, the Registrable Securities do not become ineligible to be
sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. 3\. Non-Solicitation. (i)
Manager agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date,
Manager and the Investors will not directly or indirectly: (a) solicit (other
than general solicitations through newspapers or other media of general
circulation, or the engagement of professional search firms, not targeted at
such employees) any employees of Plaza or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing ("Plaza Employees"); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to any Plaza Employee (1) who does not become an employee of PPBI or
any of its Subsidiaries or is terminated by PPBI or any of its Subsidiaries
without cause on or after the Closing Date; or (2) whose employment terminated
more than six months prior to the time that such Plaza Employee is first
solicited for employment following the Closing Date; or (b) knowingly (1)

engaging in business with any Person who was not solicited in violation of
Section 3(i)(b)(2), or (2) solicit or target the deposits, loans or other
products and services from or to Persons who were depositors, borrowers or
customers of Plaza or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and/or

 ![](exhibit21ppbiagreemenac5109.jpg) 

E-5 #52027286_v14 any other way except for general solicitations that are
directed to the general public and not directed specifically to Persons who
were depositors, borrowers or customers of Plaza or its Subsidiaries on the
date of this Agreement, or as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for purposes of clarity, nothing herein shall prohibit the
Manager or the Investors from exercising their discretion relating to their
business banking relationships. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 shall not apply to any
affiliate, representative, client or portfolio company of Manager. (ii) The
Manager acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by Plaza and its
Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants made by the Manager
in this Section 3 are made as a necessary inducement for PPBI to enter into
the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

provisions of this Section 3 shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that although
the Manager and PPBI each consider the restrictions contained in this Section
3 to be reasonable, if a final determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or territory or any other
restriction contained in this Section 3 is unenforceable against any party,
the provisions of this Section 3 shall be deemed amended to apply as to such
maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may
judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. (iii) The Manager
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement are necessary
to protect PPBI's legitimate business interests and to protect the value of
PPBI's acquisition of Plaza. (iv) The Manager will not, at any time during
the two-year period referred to in Subsection 3(i) of this Agreement,
disparage PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, or the business
conducted by PPBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, or any
stockholder, member, director, manager, officer, employee or agent of PPBI,
its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates. 4\. Termination. This letter
agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect,
without any action on the part of any of the parties hereto, in the event of
the sale of substantially all of the assets PPBI or a change of control of
PPBI, which shall be deemed to include any transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which the shareholders of PPBI prior to such
transaction or series of transactions hold less than a majority of the voting
power of PPBI or any successor in interest thereto or less than a majority in
interest of all or substantially all of the assets of PPBI. 5\. Confidential
Information. The Manager and each Investor agrees that it will not disclose
to any third party any information provided by PPBI or Pacific Premier
hereunder, which is not generally available to the public or which is
specifically designated by PPBI or Pacific Premier as confidential, except
with the prior express approval of PPBI's Chief Executive Officer, or as may
otherwise be required by applicable law.

agreement constitutes the only agreement between the Investors and the
Manager, on the one hand, and PPBI and Pacific Premier, on the other hand,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or

basis in the California Courts. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits
to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the California Courts for the
