must select a position with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net

reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages in respect of which a claim could be made under this
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> or any other provision of this Agreement, provided such mitigation does not
unreasonably disrupt the ongoing business operations of the Indemnified Party. Any costs or
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with such
mitigation shall constitute &#147;Damages&#148; that may be recovered by the Indemnified Party under this
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that an Indemnified Party
shall not be obliged to make or pursue any claim or right it may have against an insurer or any
other Person for insurance, indemnity, reimbursement or other payment.

respect to the matters to which those Damages relate and (b)&nbsp;any third-party insurance proceeds and
recoveries in respect of third party indemnification obligations actually received by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Damages. If an Indemnified Party receives such insurance
proceeds or indemnification recoveries in connection with Damages for which it has received
indemnification, such party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance
proceeds when received, up to the amount of indemnification received.

herein or therein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Indemnified Party in
connection with any Damages arising out of the matters set forth in this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that nothing herein will
limit in any way any such party&#146;s (A)&nbsp;remedies in respect of fraud, a violation of Rule&nbsp;10b-5 under
