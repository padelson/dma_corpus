provided in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Effect of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) _General Effect_. All the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises
and assets of the Operating Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Company, and all Indebtedness, Liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Operating Company and Merger Sub shall become the Indebtedness, Liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Surviving Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Managers_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the managers of the
Operating Company shall tender their resignations as managers, and at the
Effective Time, the managers of Merger Sub shall be the managers of the
Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be.

 



 

(c) _Operating Agreement._ At the Effective Time, the Operating Agreement of
Merger Sub shall be the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended as provided by Law.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Operating Company Units_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Operating Company or the Securityholders, the issued and outstanding Units
shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into (i) in the case of
Units held by VMG Blocker Corp. at the Effective time, such number of units of
the Surviving Company so that the percentage of the outstanding units of the
Surviving Company owned by VMG Blocker Corp. immediately after the Effective
Time is equal to the percentage of outstanding Units of the Operating Company
owned by VMG Blocker Corp. immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
in the case of all other issued and outstanding Units, the right to receive a
portion of the Aggregate Consideration as set forth below in _Section 2.03_
(Consideration), payable, without interest, to the Securityholders owning such

amount payable under this _Section 2.02(d)_ being the " _Merger Consideration_

such Securityholder (the " _Individual Option Consideration_ ", and, the
aggregate amount payable to all Unit Holders under this _Section 2.02(e)_
being the " _Option Consideration_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
execution of a Letter of Transmittal and a Unit Option Termination Agreement
by every holder of Unit Options is not a condition to the Closing, as
described in Article VIII, and neither the Target Companies nor their
respective shareholders or members, as applicable, shall be deemed to have
breached this Agreement as a result of such non-execution; provided that no
holder of a Unit Option shall be paid its portion of the Option Consideration
unless such holder first delivers an executed Letter of Transmittal and a Unit
Option Termination Agreement. Any payment of the Option Consideration to a
holder of Unit

Capital, _minus_ (e) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working
Capital is less than the Minimum Target Working Capital, _minus_ (f) Estimated
Transaction Expenses (such amount is referred to herein as the " _Aggregate
Consideration_ "). _Schedule 1.1_ , as adjusted from time to time as provided
herein, reflects the allocation of Stock Purchase Consideration, Merger
Consideration or Option Consideration, as applicable, to the Securityholders
entitled thereto and their pro rata interests in and to the Indemnification
Escrow Funds.

 



 

Section 2.04 _Closing Payments, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the Sellers Representative (or, with
respect to Securityholders holding Unit Options and who are employees of the
Operating Company, such other representative or agent designated thereby) on
behalf of each Securityholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from Parent to an account designated in writing by the Sellers Representative
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount, in the
aggregate, equal to (i) the Aggregate Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, _minus_ (iii) the Reserve Amount (the " _Closing
Payment_ "). The Sellers Representative, or its designated representative or
agent on its behalf, shall act as paying agent in effecting the exchange of
cash for the Blocker Shares, Units and Unit Options, and shall distribute, in
cash, an amount equal to:

 



 

(i) with respect to VMG Tax-Exempt LP, but subject to delivery by such
Securityholder to the Sellers Representative of a fully executed Letter of
Transmittal, an amount equal to the Stock Purchase Closing Payment;

 



 

(ii) with respect to each Securityholder holding Units, but subject to
delivery by such Securityholder to the Sellers Representative of a fully
executed Letter of Transmittal, the Unit Closing Payment Amount;

 



 

(iii) with respect to each Securityholder holding Unit Options, but subject to
delivery by such Securityholder to the Sellers Representative of a fully-
executed Letter of Transmittal and an Option Termination Agreement, the Unit
Option Closing Payment Amount (which, for Securityholders who are employees of
the Operating Company that own Unit Options but do not own Units, Sellers
Representative shall pay, or cause to be paid, through the payroll system of
the Operating Company (net of any Taxes required to be withheld from any
payment of the Option Consideration));

 



 

in each case in accordance with the funds flow schedule attached hereto as
_Schedule 2.04(a)_ (the " _Funds Flow_ "). Within five (5) Business Days of
the later of the date of the Specified Holder Approval and the date of the
Board Approval, the Sellers Representative shall

 



      
 

 



 

distribute to each Securityholder a letter of transmittal in substantially the
form and substance of _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ). At or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each
Securityholder who has not already delivered such documents prior to the
Effective Time shall deliver to the Sellers Representative a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions therein and any other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions. The Sellers Representative shall promptly
provide confirmation of receipt of the Letter of Transmittal to Parent.
Promptly following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y)
delivery by a Securityholder of its executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Sellers Representative, the Sellers Representative shall deliver to such
Securityholder, the payment to which such Securityholder is entitled under
this _Section 2.04(a)_. Until a Letter of Transmittal is so delivered, each
Unit shall represent solely the right to receive the payment to which such
Securityholder is entitled under this _Section 2.04(a)_ , without interest,
and neither the Surviving Company nor the Sellers Representative shall be
required to pay the holder thereof the cash to which it would otherwise have
been entitled. No Securityholder may modify the form or substance of a Letter
of Transmittal or a Unit Option Termination Agreement without the prior
written approval of Parent (email being sufficient) except for any such
modification that is immaterial and nonsubstantive.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the Escrow Agent an amount equal to
the Indemnification Escrow Funds, which amount shall be deposited and held by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of
the Target Companies, all Estimated Indebtedness that is required to be repaid
at the Closing for which Payoff Letters have been provided no later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In order to facilitate the
repayment of Estimated Indebtedness that is required to be repaid at the
Closing, or that is otherwise being repaid at the Closing, the Target
Companies shall obtain payoff letters for all Estimated Indebtedness of the
Target Companies as of the Closing Date (" _Payoff Letters_ "), which Payoff
Letters shall indicate that the lenders have agreed to immediately release all
Liens in respect of such Indebtedness relating to the assets and properties of
the Target Companies upon receipt of the amounts indicated in such Payoff
Letters.

 



 

(d) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Target Companies and Securityholders, all Estimated Transaction Expenses. The
Parties acknowledge that the Indebtedness of the Target Companies as of the
Closing Date and the Transaction Expenses are obligations of the Target
Companies or the Securityholders incurred on or before the Closing Date, and
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to make them obligations of Parent.
Payment of the Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction Expenses by Parent
on behalf of the Target Companies and the Securityholders on the Closing Date
is being made for convenience only.

 



 

Section 2.05 _The Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of The Giannuzzi Group, LLP, 411 West 14th Street, 4th Floor, New
York, New York 10014, commencing at 11:59 p.m. local time on the second

Closing itself) or such other date as the Parties may mutually determine (the
" _Closing Date_ "). On or as soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Operating Company and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a duly executed certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_

filings or recordings required by the DLLCA or other applicable Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as

_Effective Time_ ").

definitive closing payment schedule (the " _Closing Certificate_ "), duly
certified by an officer of the Operating Company as accurately setting forth
Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Working Capital, Estimated
Transaction Expenses and Aggregate Consideration (each, an " _Estimated
Closing Calculation_ " and, collectively, the " _Estimated Closing
Calculations_ "), in each case together with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation. The Estimated Closing Calculations shall be determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
the Target Companies past practices. At the request of Parent, Sellers shall
cause the Target Companies to perform, jointly with Parent or its
Representatives, a physical count of the inventory of the Target Companies as
of a date prior to Closing reasonably requested by the Parent. Parent shall be
entitled to review, comment on and request reasonable changes to the Closing
Certificate, and the Sellers Representative and the Target Companies shall
cooperate with Parent and its representatives in connection therewith. The
Sellers Representative shall consider Parents proposed changes to the
Closing Certificate in good faith.

 



 

Section 2.08 _Post Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly, but in any event within forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a
consolidated balance sheet of the Target Companies (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), which shall reflect Parents determination of (i) Cash,
Indebtedness of the Target Companies, Transaction Expenses and Working Capital
(each a " _Proposed Closing Calculation_ "), in each case determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
the Target Companies past practices, (ii) Aggregate Consideration (calculated
with reference to the amounts set forth in clause (i) of this sentence) ("
_Preliminary Aggregate Consideration_ ") and (iii) the Proposed Adjustment
Amount, if any, in each case of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), together with such
detail and supporting documentation as shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Sellers Representative, and provided that Parent shall thereafter have the
continuing obligation to provide the Sellers Representative with access to
additional books, records and work papers related thereto, including those of
Parents and the Target Companies accountants, if any, in each case, within
three (3) Business Days following the Sellers Representative reasonable
request therefor, until such time as the Final Adjustment Amount has been
determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that
Sellers Representative shall execute any confidentiality, representation,
non-reliance or other letter that is reasonably requested by Parents or the
Target Companies accountants, if any, in connection therewith. The "
_Proposed Adjustment Amount_ " (which may be a positive or negative number)
shall be equal to the Preliminary Aggregate Consideration (which shall
separately set forth the Stock Purchase Consideration, the Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration) as set forth on the Closing
Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.08(a)_ , _minus_ the
Sellers Representatives determination of Aggregate Consideration (which
shall separately set forth the Stock Purchase Consideration, the Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration), as set forth in the Closing
Certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.07_ (Closing Certificate).

 



 

(b) If the Sellers Representative disagrees with Parents determination of
any Proposed Closing Calculation, Preliminary Aggregate Consideration or the
Proposed Adjustment Amount, in each case, as reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Sellers Representative may, within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, deliver a written notice (the " _Dispute
Notice_ ") to Parent setting forth the Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives calculation of each disputed amount (each an " _Item of
Dispute_ "). In preparing such Dispute Notice, the Sellers Representative
shall have access to all items reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative related to the Closing Balance Sheet. If Parent does not
receive a Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers
Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet shall
be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties. If Parent receives a
Dispute Notice from the Sellers Representative within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Sellers Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet, Parent
and the Sellers Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve each Item of Dispute, and, if any Item of Dispute is so resolved, the
Closing Balance Sheet shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect
such resolution. If any Item of Dispute remains unresolved as of the twentieth
(20th) day after delivery by the Sellers Representative of the Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Sellers Representative shall jointly retain Grant
Thornton LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such remaining
disagreement. Parent and the Sellers Representative shall request that the
Accounting Firm render a determination as to each unresolved Item of Dispute
within thirty (30) days after its retention, and the Sellers Representative,
Parent, the Target Companies and their respective Representatives shall
cooperate fully with the Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such
determination as quickly and accurately as practicable, including the
provision by Parent and the Target Companies of all books and records and work
papers (including those of accountants) relating to the Closing Balance Sheet
and all other items reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm. The
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts that were set
forth in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Dispute Notice and that remain
unresolved by Parent and the Sellers Representative. In resolving any Item of
Dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Person or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Person. The Accounting Firms
determination(s) shall be based upon the definitions of Preliminary Aggregate
Consideration, Proposed Adjustment Amount and each Preliminary Closing
Calculation (as applicable) included in this Agreement. The Accounting Firms
determination of each Item of Dispute submitted to it shall be in writing,
shall conform with this _Section 2.08_ and shall be conclusive and binding
upon each of the Parties, and the Closing Balance Sheet shall be modified to
the extent necessary to reflect such determination(s). The Accounting Firm
shall provide a determination of the "Final Adjustment Amount" (which may be a
positive or negative number) which shall be equal to the Accounting Firms
determination of Aggregate Consideration (which shall be determined with
reference to Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Transactions Expenses and
Final Working Capital) pursuant to this _Section 2.08_ _minus_ the Sellers
Representatives determination of Aggregate Consideration set forth in the
Closing Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.07(Closing Certificate).
The Accounting Firm shall allocate its fees, costs and expenses between
Parent, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each such Party bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party. Cash, Indebtedness of the Target
Companies, Transaction Expenses and Working Capital, in each case as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.08_ , are referred to herein as "
_Final Cash_ ," " _Final Indebtedness_ ," " _Final Transaction Expenses_ " and
" _Final Working Capital_ ," respectively.

 



 

(c) The " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be a positive or negative
number, shall be equal to (i) the amount agreed to as the Final Adjustment
Amount (which

 



      
 

 



 

shall set forth the allocation of such amount between the Stock Purchase
Consideration, the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration) at any
time in writing by Parent and the Sellers Representative; (ii) if a Closing
Balance Sheet is not delivered by Parent within the time period required by
_Section 2.08(a)_ , if the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion,
elects, the Final Adjustment Amount will be $0.00; (iii) if a Dispute Notice
is not delivered by the Sellers Representative to Parent within the time
period required by _Section 2.08(a)_ , the Proposed Adjustment Amount set
forth in the Closing Balance Sheet, if any; or (iv) the Final Adjustment
Amount as set forth in the written determination of the Accounting Firm made
in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.08_.

 



 

(d) _Payments_. Within five (5) days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount: (i) if the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the account(s) designated in writing
by the Sellers Representative an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment
Amount; or (ii) if the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the
Sellers Representative and Parent shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to
pay to the account designated in writing by Parent an amount in cash from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds equal to the absolute value of the Final
Adjustment Amount.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Updating Percentage Allocations; Allocation of the Aggregate
Consideration_. In the event there are any adjustments to be made to the
Percentage Allocations after the date hereof, including, without limitation,
in connection with any payments required to be made by Parent or by or on
behalf of the Securityholders pursuant to _Section 2.09_ or _ARTICLE X_
(Indemnification), the Sellers Representative shall promptly deliver an
updated _Schedule 1.1_ , to both (i) Parent, for Parents review, and (ii)
each affected Securityholder, reflecting a revised Percentage Allocation for
each Securityholder (including, after giving effect to the manner in which
Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction Expenses, Final Working
Capital and the Final Adjustment Amount are calculated and the allocation of
the Aggregate Consideration, in accordance with the terms of Section 2.04, to
each Securityholder in accordance with the Target Companies Charter
Documents). The Parties agree to allocate the Aggregate Consideration, in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.04 (and all other capitalizable costs)
to each Securityholder according to such Securityholders Percentage
Allocation, in each case, as adjusted as provided herein; provided that such
allocation of the Aggregate Consideration to VMG Tax-Exempt L.P. shall not
exceed 5.5% of the Aggregate Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Sellers Representative,
Parent, the Surviving Company and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment to any Party under this Agreement or the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement such Taxes as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment, or any other Tax
withholding obligation with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted by the
Sellers Representative, Parent, the Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Sellers Representative, Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be. The Sellers
Representative, Parent, the Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, shall pay over to the appropriate Governmental Authority amounts
withheld under this _Section 2.10_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.11 _Reserve Account; Letter of Transmittal_. The Sellers
Representative is establishing a reserve account from the Aggregate
Consideration (the " _Reserve Account_ ") in the aggregate amount of Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($2,500,000) (the " _Reserve
Amount_ ") to pay any costs, fees, Taxes and expenses incurred at any time,
whether arising prior to or after the Closing, by or for the benefit of the
Target Companies or their Securityholders, and regardless of whether at the
Closing such costs, fees, Taxes and expenses are actual, estimated or
contingent, anticipated or unanticipated, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. At the Closing, Parent shall wire the Reserve
Amount to an account designated by the Sellers Representative. To the extent
amounts placed into the Reserve Account are not used, or in the judgment of
the Sellers Representative are not expected to be used, to pay fees, Taxes
and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including costs associated with any post-Closing issues or
disputes, such remaining amount ( _ _plus__ all earnings thereon, if any),
shall be distributed by the Sellers Representative to the applicable
Securityholders in proportion to their respective Percentage Allocation. The
Sellers Representative shall have sole and exclusive authority to disburse
and pay amounts placed into the Reserve Account consistent with the provisions
of this Agreement. Each Letter of Transmittal executed by a Securityholder
shall include an agreement to be bound by all of the obligations and to
perform all of the covenants of the Securityholders set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Payments to the Sellers  Representative_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, payment in full to or at the direction of the
Sellers Representative shall be deemed to satisfy and discharge in full all
of Parents and Merger Subs obligations and any liability to the Sellers
Representative and the Securityholders under this Agreement with respect
thereto upon receipt of such payments by the Sellers Representative,
regardless of whether such payments are further distributed or paid to each
Securityholder.

be responsible for the costs and expenses of their respective filings;
provided that Parent shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) all of the
filing fees payable under the HSR Act and the Securityholders shall be
responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all of the filing fees payable under

upon reasonable advance notice, and in a manner so as not to interfere with
the normal business operations of the Target Companies, to all premises,
properties, executive officers, books, records, policies, contracts and
documents of the Target Companies; provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to any information the disclosure of which would, in
the Target Companies or the Sellers Representatives sole discretion, waive
any privilege.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.04 _Supplemental Schedules_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, any Party making any representation or warranty
hereunder (as the case may be, the " _Updating Party_ ") shall be entitled
(but not required) to update, amend or modify the Schedules relating to the
representations and warranties in _ARTICLE III_ (Representations and
Warranties of the Target Companies), _ARTICLE IV_ (Representations and
Warranties of Certain VMG Parties) and _ARTICLE V_ (Representations and
Warranties of the Acquiring Companies), respectively, to reflect any facts,
circumstances or events (including the occurrence or non-occurrence thereof)
which would cause any such representation or warranty made by a Party to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, by providing Parent (in the case
of an update, amendment or modification by any Party other than the Acquiring
Companies) or the Sellers Representative (in the case of an update, amendment
or modification by Parent or Merger Sub), as applicable, with written notice
setting forth the update, amendment or modification and specifying the
Schedule or Schedules affected thereby; provided, however, that any such
update, amendment or modification (other than a Material Update as set forth
below) shall not cure any misrepresentation or breach of representations and
warranties that would have existed hereunder had such update, amendment or
modification not been provided. If any such update, amendment or modification
discloses any material development first arising during the period subsequent
to the date of this Agreement that would cause an inability of the Updating
Party to deliver the officers certificate to be delivered hereunder at
Closing by it as contemplated by _Section 8.02_ (Conditions to Obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub) or _Section 8.03_ (Conditions to Obligations of the
Target Companies, VMG General Partner and VMG Tax-Exempt LP), without giving
effect to this _Section 6.04_ , as the case may be (a " _Material Update_ "),
the Updating Party must promptly provide to Parent (in the case of Material
Update by any Party other than the Acquiring Companies) or the Sellers
Representative (in the case of a Material Update by Parent or Merger Sub), as
applicable, any information or documentation reasonably requested by Parent or
the Sellers Representative, as applicable, in order for such Person to
evaluate the Material Update, and, if the Material Update is provided less
than ten (10) Business Days before the Outside Date, the Outside Date will be
extended until ten (10) Business Days after the Material Update to afford the
other Parties an opportunity to review such information. After receiving the
Material Update and the related information and documentation reasonably
requested by it, Parent (in the case of Material Update by any Party other
than the Acquiring Companies) or the Sellers Representative (in the case of a
Material Update by Parent or Merger Sub), as applicable, will have ten (10)
Business Days to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the
Updating Party, with such termination being the sole remedy relating to
matters set forth in the Material Update, and if such Person does not
terminate this Agreement within such period, the Material Update will amend
the applicable Schedule, qualify the specific representations and warranties
contained in the Material Update, and cure the specific misrepresentation or
breach of representations and warranties that would have existed hereunder had
the Material Update not been provided.

 



 

Section 6.05 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives shall contact or communicate with the customers and suppliers
of the Operating Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or about the Operating Company in any way, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Operating Company and the Sellers
Representative.

partnership of VMG Splitter LP (ii) then cause VMG Splitter LP to be
dissolved. .

 



 

Section 6.07 _Financial Information Cooperation_. The Target Companies and the
Securityholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the sole expense
of Parent, to furnish to Parent as promptly as practicable the financial and
other information regarding the Target Companies as may be reasonably
requested by Parent to satisfy any disclosure requirements applicable to
Parent under Regulations S-X or S-K of the Securities Act, and other
applicable securities Laws, including the execution and delivery of customary
representation letters to McGladrey LLP and audit reports thereon by such
accounting firm, together with any consents required for Parent to use or
disclose such reports. The obligations of the Securityholders in this _Section
6.07_ shall survive the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.08 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 



 

Section 6.09 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 6.09_ , at or prior to the Closing, the Target Companies shall enter
into termination agreements with respect to each of the agreements set forth
on _Schedule 3.25_ , pursuant to which termination agreements neither the
Target Companies nor the Surviving Company shall have any further financial or
other obligation thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Release of Liens_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
Representative shall deliver to Parent, on behalf of the Target Companies,
such Lien releases or other written evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, evidencing the release of all Liens on the assets of the Target
Companies and its subsidiaries that are not Permitted Liens.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_. Prior to the Closing, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly contemplated by the terms
of this Agreement, the Target Companies shall not do any of the following in
connection with the business of the Target Companies or otherwise without the
prior written consent of Parent:

 



 

(a) Other than in the Ordinary Course of Business or as required by law, enter
into, terminate, adopt or amend in any material respect any employment, change
in control or severance agreement or any other Employee Benefit Plan or
collective bargaining agreement, except as required by applicable Law; or

 



 

(b) Other than in the Ordinary Course of Business or as required by law, (A)
grant any increase in compensation or benefits, or make any award or grant
under any Employee Benefit Plan, to any current or former director,
consultant, officer or employee, except for payment of the Contingent Bonuses
set forth in _Schedule 1.2_ (which shall be paid upon the occurrence of the
Closing) and increases in compensation to employees other than directors or
officers as may be required under existing agreements or applicable Law, (B)
hire any new employee (other than to fill a vacancy or replace a terminated

accordance with past practice.

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

Section 7.01 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or reasonably required to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request.

 



 

Section 7.02 _Press Releases_. From and after the date of this Agreement,
except to the extent required by applicable Law or stock exchange
requirements, the Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, issue any press
release or public announcement of any kind concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent and
the Sellers Representative, and, in the event any such public announcement,
press release or disclosure is required by applicable Law or stock exchange
requirements, the Parties will consult with one another prior to the making
thereof to the extent reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
on and after the Closing Date, the Target Companies shall be permitted (i) to
disclose to their respective and prospective members and stockholders (who may
disclose to their direct and indirect investors) the fact that the Closing has
occurred, the Aggregate Consideration paid hereunder and other items directly
relating to the Aggregate Consideration and (ii) to disclose on their websites
and in their marketing materials the nature and general terms of the
transactions contemplated hereunder (which disclosure may be accompanied by
the logos of the Operating Company and Parent).

with respect to the filing fees required to be paid under the HSR Act, each
Party shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses

contemplated hereby or otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that, in the event of a Closing, Parent shall pay the Transaction Expenses
that were reflected in the calculation of Aggregate Consideration on behalf of
the Securityholders as provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
regardless of whether the Closing occurs or this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_ (Termination), any fees or expenses of
any Party incurred by, at the direction of or for the benefit of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates (including for the purpose of obtaining
any third party consents) shall be paid by Parent.

 



 

Section 7.04 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Parent acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between Guarantor and the Operating Company dated March 5, 2013 (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating to the Target
Companies.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Securityholders will, and will cause
their Affiliates to, keep confidential and protect, and will not divulge,
allow access to or use in any way, any and all information concerning the

that is not generally known to the public. The Securityholders acknowledge
that such confidential information constitutes a unique and valuable asset of
the Target Companies.

 



 

(c) The Securityholders further acknowledge that Parent has required that the
Securityholders make the agreements in _Section 7.04(b)_ as a condition to
Parents willingness to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Securityholders agree that the agreements contained in _Section
7.04(b)_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Parent and that any violation or breach of _Section 7.04(b)_ will result in
irreparable injury to Parent and the Target Companies for which no adequate
remedy would exist at law. Accordingly, in addition to any relief at law that
may be available to Parent or the Target Companies for such violation or
breach and regardless of any other provision contained in this Agreement,
Parent and the Target Companies will be entitled to injunctive and other
equitable relief restraining such violation or breach.

responsible for complying with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code for any individual who is an

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.06 _Provision Respecting Representation of the Securityholders_.
Each of the Parties hereby agrees that each of The Giannuzzi Group, LLP, The
Di Salvo Group PLLC and Edward Wildman Palmer LLP (each, a " _Company Counsel_
") may serve as counsel to each and any Securityholder, on the one hand, and
the Target Companies, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each Company Counsel (or any of their
respective successors) may serve as counsel to the Securityholders in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation of the Target Companies, and each of the
Parties hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. The Parties acknowledge that each Company Counsel has represented
and performed services for the Target Companies prior to the Closing, and that
any information obtained during past representation of the Target Companies by
such Company Counsel (or any of their respective successors), shall be
permitted to be used by Company Counsel for such litigation, claim or
obligation, provided, however, that Company Counsel shall not be permitted to
disclose such information to any third party unrelated to such litigation,
claim or obligation without Parents written consent.

 



 

Section 7.07 _Post-Closing Record Retention and Access_. From and after the
Closing, Parent shall provide the Securityholders and their authorized
Representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, to any books and records and other
materials relating to periods prior to the Closing Date in connection with
general purposes, whether or not relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (including , with respect to taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the
preparation of Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns or claim for refund (and any
materials necessary for the preparation of any of the foregoing), and
financial statements for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and
the management and handling of any Action, whether such Action is a matter
with respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder), or to comply
with the rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service,

 



      
 

 



 

the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other Governmental Authority.
Parents obligations with respect to such books and records shall include
maintaining, for a period of at least seven (7) years following the Closing
Date, computer systems permitting reasonable access to any such books and
records which are stored in electronic form in a fashion which is not
materially less efficient than current access methods. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by the Sellers Representative, Parent shall not
permit, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, the
destruction, alteration or other disposition of any books and records and
other materials of the Target Companies, or any portions thereof, relating to
periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender to the
Sellers Representative such books and records and materials or such portions
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any Target Company shall be required to disclose any information to
the Securityholders or their authorized Representatives if such disclosure
would contravene any Laws or binding judgments or orders of any Governmental
Authority.

 



 

Section 7.08 _Further Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parent and the Sellers Representative
shall allocate adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration required by _Section
2.08_ (Post Closing Adjustment), among the Securityholders as set forth on
_Schedule 1.1_. The Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.08_ (Post Closing Adjustment), shall be
allocated for purposes of (i) applying Section 751 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.751-1 in determining the portion of the gain or loss
recognized by each holder of Operating Company interests upon the sale of such
holders membership interests pursuant to this Agreement that is attributable
to the Operating Companys "unrealized receivables" and "inventory items" (as
such terms are defined in Section 751 of the Code), (ii) computing special
basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Code and Treasury Regulations
Section 1.743-1, (iii) allocating such special basis adjustments among the
assets of the Operating Company under Section 755 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.755-1 and (iv) all other Tax purposes, based on the
respective gross fair market values of the Operating Companys assets. The
respective gross fair market values of the Operating Companys assets will be
determined by an appraisal completed by an independent valuation firm of
nationally recognized standing selected and paid for by Parent (the "
_Valuation Firm_ "), which shall be completed and submitted to Parent and the
Sellers Representative on or before 60 days following the Closing. The
appraisal provided by the Valuation Firm shall be modified, as appropriate, by
the Valuation Firm to reflect any adjustments in the Aggregate Consideration
made following the Closing in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties will
prepare and file all Tax Returns (including the statement required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.743-1(k) and Internal Revenue Service Form 8308) in a
manner consistent with this _Section 7.08(a)_ , such allocation of the Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration, and the fair market values so
determined, and neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Target Companies, the Sellers
Representative, the Securityholders, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
shall take any Tax position that is inconsistent with this _Section 7.08(a)_ ,
such allocation of the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration, or
such fair market values unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Code Section 708(b)(1)(B) Technical Tax Termination_. The Parties agree
that, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
taxable year of the

 



      
 

 



 

Operating Company shall terminate for federal and, unless required by
applicable Tax Law, any applicable state and local income Tax purposes as of
11:59 p.m. local time on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Following the Closing, the Sellers Representative shall, at the
Securityholders sole cost and expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Operating Company for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, regardless of whether such Tax Returns are due after
the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due
thereon to the extent that such Taxes were not taken into account in
determining Working Capital. Parent and the Target Companies shall cooperate
with the Sellers Representative in preparing and filing such Tax Returns,
including providing records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Tax Returns, making employees and third-party advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided, and signing and delivering to the Sellers
Representative for filing any Tax Returns prepared in accordance with this
_Section 7.08_ that are required to be signed by Parent or the Operating
Company. Parent and the Sellers Representative agree that such Tax Returns
shall include as an income Tax deduction on or before the Closing Date (x) the
amount of any Transaction Expenses (to the extent that such amounts are
deductible, taking into account the safe harbor contained in IRS Revenue
Procedure 2011-29 for "success-based fees"), (y) the Option Consideration and
(z) the employer portion of any employment Taxes on any Transaction Expenses,
provided, however, that, in the event that such deductions are deferred to a
date after the Closing Date as a result of the requirements of the Code, any
audit or other tax proceeding, Parent shall pay an additional amount to the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) equal to the amount
of such deferred deductions _multiplied by_ 45%. To the extent not discussed
in the immediately preceding sentence, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practice of the Target Companies, except as
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law. The Sellers Representative shall
provide Parent with drafts of Tax Returns no later than October 31, 2013 and
shall permit Parent to review and comment on such Tax Returns. The Sellers
Representative shall address in good faith comments on such Tax Returns
provided by Parent to the Sellers Representative in writing within ten (10)
days of receipt of such draft Tax Returns from the Sellers Representative. If
Parent and the Sellers Representative disagree about whether any such
comments should be accepted, such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance
with the provisions of Section 7.08(k) (Dispute Resolution). The Parties agree
and acknowledge that the federal Income Tax Return of the Operating Company
for the Tax period of the Operating Company that ends on the Closing Date will
include an election under Section 754 of the Code and, to the extent
applicable, an analogous election will be made in each of the state and local
Income Tax Returns of the Operating Company for that Tax period. With respect
to any such Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are not Income Tax
Returns, the Sellers Representative will provide Parent with drafts of such
Tax Returns no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date thereof
(taking into account any extensions thereof) and shall address in good faith
comments on such Tax Returns provided by Parent relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are received in writing from Parent within five (5) days of
receipt of such draft Tax Returns from the Sellers Representative. If Parent
and the Sellers Representative disagree about whether any such comments
should be accepted, such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance with the

 



      
 

 



 

provisions of Section 7.08(k) (Dispute Resolution). For avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 7.08(c)_ shall apply to any information returns (such as IRS
Forms 1099) filed or issued with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the
Target Companies.

 



 

(ii) The Securityholders shall cause VMG Blocker Corp. to pay estimated Taxes
or set aside in cash an amount to pay Taxes reasonably estimated to be payable
by VMG Blocker Corp. up to and including the Closing Date. The Sellers
Representative shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Buyer all books and
records and other documentation relating to any estimated Taxes payable by or
on account of VMG Blocker Corp. or the Operating Company (including the amount
of any such estimated Taxes due (including estimates thereof) and the due date
for such Taxes) for (x) any Pre-Closing Tax Period no later than two(2) days
prior to the Closing Date, and (y) any Straddle Period no later than five (5)
days prior to the due date of any such estimated Taxes. Following the Closing,
Parent shall, at the Securityholders sole cost and expense, prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for VMG Blocker
Corp. for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are not filed on or before the
Closing Date and all Straddle Period Returns for the Target Companies. Such
Tax Returns and Straddle Period Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Tax Return preparation standards set forth in _Section
7.08(c)(i)_ (including those standards set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of
_Section 7.08(c)(i)_ ). Parent shall provide Sellers Representative with
drafts of any such Tax Returns and Straddle Period Returns that are Income Tax
Returns no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (taking
into account any extensions thereof) and shall permit Sellers Representative
to review and comment on such Tax Returns and Straddle Period Returns. The
Sellers Representatives good faith comments on such Income Tax Returns that
are provided by the Sellers Representative to Parent in writing within ten
(10) days of receipt of such draft Tax Returns and Straddle Period from Parent
shall be incorporated by Parent into such Tax Returns and Straddle Period
Returns that are Income Tax Returns. If Parent and the Sellers
Representative disagree about whether any such comments should be accepted,
such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7.08(k) (Dispute Resolution). With respect to any such Tax Returns or
Straddle Period Returns that are not Income Tax Returns, Parent will provide
the Sellers Representative with drafts of such Tax Returns or such Straddle
Period Returns no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof
(taking into account any extensions thereof) and Parent shall address in good

the Sellers Representative to Parent in writing within ten (10) days of
receipt of such draft Tax Returns or Straddle Period Returns from Parent. If
Parent and the Sellers Representative disagree about whether any such
comments should be accepted, such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance
with the provisions of Section 7.08(k) (Dispute Resolution). On or prior to
the date that Parent files or causes to be filed any Tax Return prepared in
accordance with this _Section 7.08(c)(ii)_ , the Securityholders shall pay to
Parent an amount equal to the Taxes allocable to the Securityholders with
respect to such Tax Return (determined, with respect to any Straddle Period
Return, in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 7.08(d)_ ),
net of any Taxes paid or set aside pursuant to this _Section 7.08(c)(ii)_ or
any such Taxes included in the calculation of Working Capital.

 



 

(d) _Straddle Period_. Taxes for any Tax period of the Target Companies that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall
be allocated for all purposes of this Agreement (i) to the Securityholders for
the portion of the Tax period up to

 



      
 

 



 

and including the Closing Date and (ii) to Parent for the portion of the Tax
period beginning after the Closing Date. For that purpose, (A) real, personal
and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied on an annual or other
periodic basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of the Target Companies for a Straddle
Period shall be allocated between the periods described in clauses (i) and
(ii) of the preceding sentence on a per diem basis based on the number of days
during the Straddle Period ending with and including the Closing Date and
number of days during the Straddle Period commencing on the day after the
Closing Date, and (B) Taxes that are not Per Diem Taxes, including Income
Taxes and any transactional Taxes such as Taxes based on sales, revenue or
payments of the Target Companies for a Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the periods described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding
sentence as if such Tax period ended as of the end of the Closing Date. For
purposes of clause (B) of the preceding sentence, any allocation of gross or
net income or deductions or other items required to determine any Taxes
attributable to such a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of
the books and records of the Target Companies as of the end of the Closing
Date, provided that exemptions, allowances, deductions or periodic Taxes (such
as property Taxes) that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not
limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales and transfer taxes, recording charges and
similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
together with any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes,
shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Securityholders. The Sellers
Representative and Parent shall cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the
provisions of all applicable Tax Laws in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest
extent possible under such Tax Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes
payable in connection therewith.

 



 

(f) _Tax Indemnification_. The Securityholders shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify Parent and its Affiliates from and against all liability for
(i) Taxes of the Target Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date
(determined in accordance with _Section 7.08(d)_ (Straddle Period)), (ii)
Transfer Taxes (together with any interest, penalties or additions to such
Transfer Taxes) that are the responsibility of the Securityholders pursuant to
_Section 7.08(e)_ and (iii) any Taxes required to be withheld from any payment
to any Seller under this Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow Agreement
which the Sellers Representative fails to withhold pursuant to _Section 2.10_
and which are asserted by any Governmental Authority to be the responsibility
of Parent. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 7.08(i)_ (Tax Proceedings), payment of the Tax to the
appropriate Governmental Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier
than the date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
Governmental Authority or court unless payment of the Tax is required as a
condition to a contest. Parent and its Affiliates shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify the Securityholders from and against all liability
for Transfer Taxes (together with any interest, penalties or additions to such
Transfer Taxes) that are the responsibility of the Parent or any Affiliate
pursuant to _Section 7.08(e)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Tax Refunds_. The Securityholders shall be entitled to any refunds
received for federal, state, local or foreign Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date (determined in accordance with _Section 7.08(d)_ of the Target
Companies, along with any interest paid with respect thereto by the relevant
Taxing Authority. Parent shall cause any such refunds (including interest) to
which the Securityholders are entitled that are received by the Target
Companies or any Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date, whether by offset,
credit, receipt of payment or otherwise, to be paid promptly to the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Securityholders, net of all out-of-pocket
reasonable, actual third-party expenses (including Taxes) incurred by Parent,
the Target Companies, or any Affiliate thereof with respect thereto. Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative,
amend any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and in the event that
Sellers Representative desires to amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, the provisions of _Section 7.08(j)_ shall apply.

 



 

(h) _Post Closing Transactions; Certain Tax Agreements_. The Securityholders
shall terminate, or shall cause to be terminated, on or prior to the Closing
Date, any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnity agreement to which any
of the Target Companies is a party, except as otherwise expressly contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(i) _Tax Proceedings_. If a claim shall be made by any Governmental Authority
in respect of the Target Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall
promptly and in any event no more than ten (10) days following Parents
receipt of such claim, give written notice to the Sellers Representative of
such claim; provided, however, that the failure of Parent to give such notices
shall only relieve the Securityholders from their indemnification obligations
hereunder to the extent they are actually prejudiced by such failure. With
respect to any Tax claim of the Operating Company for which the
Securityholders may have an indemnification obligation hereunder, the Sellers
Representative shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken
in connection with such Tax claim (including selection of counsel or any
accounting firm) at the Securityholders expense subject to the requirements
of this _Section 7.08(i)_ ; provided that Parent shall control, and the
Securityholders shall be liable for reasonable third party expenses of any
such Tax claim relating to VMG Blocker Corp. Proceedings in connection with
any Tax claim relating to the Target Companies for any period for which the
Securityholders would not have an indemnification obligation hereunder shall
be the responsibility of Parent. The Sellers Representative shall promptly
notify Parent if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any
Tax claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period which it is entitled to control
pursuant to this Agreement. No Tax claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
which the Sellers Representative is entitled to control all proceedings may
be settled without the written consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent, the Securityholders,
the Sellers Representative, the Target Companies and each of their respective
Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with each other in contesting any Tax
claim in accordance with this _Section 7.08(i)_ and shall keep each other
reasonably informed concerning the progress of proceedings related to Tax
claims for which the Securityholders would have an indemnification obligation
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, (i) in the case of a Tax claim for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which the Sellers Representative is entitled to
control all proceedings, Parent may participate in such proceedings (including
through its own counsel) at Parents expense, and (ii) in the case of a Tax
claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Parent is entitled to control all
proceedings, the Sellers

 



       
 

 



 

Representative may participate in such proceedings (including through its own
counsel) at the Securityholders expense. The Parties shall satisfy their
indemnity obligations pursuant to _Section 7.08(f)_ (Tax Indemnification)
within ten (10) days after a final determination (within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code or analogous provisions of state, local or foreign
Tax Law) or settlement of the relevant Tax claim is made.

 



 

(j) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Target Companies, the Securityholders and the
Sellers Representative and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 7.08_ , any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, and other Tax matters
addressed by this _Section 7.08_. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax matters and making employees and
third-party advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Parent shall use its best efforts to provide such cooperation as necessary so
that the Tax Returns described in _Section 7.08(c)_ (Tax Returns) can be filed
no later than October 15, 2013.

 



 

(k) _Dispute Resolution_. Except as provided by _Section 7.08(a)_ (Purchase
Price Allocation) or with respect to matters addressed by _Section 7.08(i)_
(Tax Proceedings), any dispute, controversy or claim between Parent, on the
one hand, and the Securityholders or the Sellers Representative, on the other
hand, arising out of or relating to the provisions of this Agreement that
relates to Taxes that cannot be resolved by negotiations between Parent and
the Sellers Representative shall be submitted to a "Big Four" accounting firm
or Tax counsel not representing Parent or Guarantor or the Sellers
Representative within the past 24 months for any material Tax matter for
resolution in the same manner in which disputes are handled pursuant to
_Section 2.08_ (Post Closing Adjustment).

 



 

Section 7.09 _Exclusivity_. Until the earlier of the Closing Date and such
time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX, the Target
Companies and the Specified Holders shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, participate in, invite,
solicit, entertain, initiate, encourage or enter into any negotiation,
discussion or agreement with any party with respect to an acquisition of the
Units or the Target Companies or the assets of the Target Companies (other
than the inventory of the Target Companies in the Ordinary Course of Business
or obsolete equipment) or any divestiture, merger, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, redemption or similar
transaction involving the Specified Holders or the Target Companies
(collectively, a " _Proposed Transaction_ "). The Target Companies and the
Specified Holders shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees and other representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, activities and
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Proposed Transaction.

Securityholders shall cause each of Driven Pirate, LLC, and Driven Booty, LLC
to change its limited liability company or corporate name, as the case may be,

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause each of the
Target Companies and their Affiliates to not, amend, repeal or otherwise
modify the indemnification provisions of any of the Target Companies Charter
Documents as in effect at the Closing in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at the Closing were managers,
directors, shareholders, members, officers or employees of the Target
Companies. From and after the Closing, Parent shall assume, be liable for and
honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Target Companies to
honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this Section 7.11, without limit as to time. The Surviving
Company shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by an indemnified person in enforcing this Section
7.11.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Operating Company shall obtain a six-year "tail"
managers, directors and officers liability insurance policy, which shall
provide at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and
conditions, which are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than
the Operating Companys existing policy. The cost of the "tail" policy
purchased pursuant to this _Section 7.11(b)_ shall be a Transaction Expense.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Return of Confidential Information_. Promptly after the Closing,
the Target Companies (or their financial advisor, as applicable) shall request

reflected in the Final Transaction Expenses or any Contingent Bonuses, (iv)
any Taxes in accordance with _Section 7.08(f)_ , (v) any and all claims
brought by Robert Ehrlich or any of his Affiliates, and/or (vi) the matters
set forth on _Schedule 10.02_ (the " _Special Litigation_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Securityholders shall have no
liability of any nature whatsoever to any Parent Indemnified Party with
respect to the Special Litigation (as set forth on _Schedule 10.02_ ) except
with respect to Damages for which the Securityholder Indemnifying Party
receives notice in accordance with Section 10.06 on or before the date which
is thirty (30) months from the Closing Date (the " _Special Litigation End
Date_ "). In the event that the Special Litigation is

 



      
 

 



 

dismissed, resolved, or terminated by a final judgment, consent, stipulation,
or other disposition by a court of competent jurisdiction, or settled in
accordance with the terms hereof, at any time following the Survival End Date
and prior to the Special Litigation End Date, all remaining Indemnification
Escrow Funds, as herein defined, shall be released and distributed to
Securityholders in accordance with the terms hereof and subject to the terms
of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement after the payment from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party of any
amounts to be paid in connection with such dismissal, resolution, termination,
consent, stipulation or other disposition.

 



 

(b) VMG Tax-Exempt LP shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the
Parent Indemnified Parties from and against and in respect of, and pay and
reimburse each Parent Indemnified Party for, any and all Damages suffered or
paid as a result of, in connection with, relating to or arising from (i) the
breach by any of VMG Blocker Corp., VMG General Partner or VMG Tax-Exempt LP
of any representation or warranty made by such Party in this Agreement or the
Schedules or any certificate delivered hereunder, (ii) the breach of any
covenant or agreement to be performed by any such Party prior to the Closing
under this Agreement, and/or (iii) the breach of any covenant or agreement to
be performed by VMG General Partner or VMG Tax-Exempt after the Closing under
this Agreement; provided that nothing contained in this _Section 10.02(b)_
shall limit the indemnification obligations of the Securityholders set forth
in _Section 10.02(a)_.

 



 

(c) Any Party providing indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE X_ is hereinafter referred to as a " _Securityholder Indemnifying
Party_."

 



 

(d) Any Damages payable by any Securityholder Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this _Section 10.02_ shall first be paid from the Indemnification Escrow
Funds, and thereafter, directly from such Securityholder Indemnifying Party.

 



 

Section 10.03 _Indemnification by Parent and the Surviving Company_. Parent
and the Surviving Company shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Securityholders and each of their respective
Representatives (each, a " _Securityholder Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against and in respect of, and pay and reimburse each Securityholder
Indemnified Party for, any and all Damages suffered or paid as a result of, in
connection with, relating to or arising from (i) the breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in
_ARTICLE V_ (Representations and Warranties of the Acquiring Companies), (ii)
the breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or agreement to be
performed by it hereunder, and/or (iii) the breach by the Target Companies of
any covenant or agreement to be performed by them after the Closing hereunder
and/or (iv) the business of the Target Companies, as conducted by Parent and
the Surviving Company on or after the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, any Damages resulting from any action or inaction of Parent or the
Surviving Company that gives rise to a claim for indemnification under
_Section 10.02_ (Indemnification by the Securityholders). Any Damages payable
by Parent and/or the Surviving Company pursuant hereto shall be paid to
Sellers Representative on behalf of each Securityholder.

 



 

Section 10.04 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Individual Claim Threshold. No Parent Indemnified Party shall make an
indemnity claim under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to
_Section 3.23(m)_ ), _Section 10.02(a)(vi)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_
(Indemnification by the Securityholders) with respect to an individual item or
series of related items of Damages unless and until the aggregate amount of
Damages suffered (or reasonably expected to be suffered if such item or series
of related items are adversely determined) by the Parent Indemnified Parties
(collectively) arising from the same or related set of facts and circumstances
exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the " _De Minimis Amount_ "). No
Securityholder Indemnified Party shall make an indemnity claim under _Section
10.03_ (i) (Indemnification by Parent) with respect to an individual item or
series of related items of Damage unless and until the aggregate amount of
Damages suffered (or reasonably expected to be suffered if such item or series
of related items are adversely determined) by the Securityholder Indemnified
Parties (collectively) arising from the same or related set of facts and
circumstances exceeds the De Minimis Amount. All such Damages arising from the
same set of facts and circumstances that do not exceed the De Minimis Amount
in the aggregate shall be excluded when determining whether the Deductible
Amount referred to in _Section 10.04(b)_ has been satisfied. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, individual claim thresholds set forth in this _Section
10.04(a)_ shall not apply to breaches of the Fundamental Representations or
breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12_
(Tax Matters).

 



 

(b) _Deductible Amount_. No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover for an indemnification claim under _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ (other than
with respect to any breach of _Section 3.23(m)_ ), _Section 10.02(a)(vi_ ) or
_Section 10.02(b)(i)_ (Indemnification by the Securityholders) unless, until
and only to the extent that any Parent Indemnified Party (individually or
collectively with all other Parent Indemnified Parties) has suffered or
incurred actual Damages aggregating in excess of One Million Six Hundred
Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($1,625,000) (the " _Deductible Amount_ "),
whereupon any Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to claim
indemnification only for amounts in excess of the Deductible Amount, subject
to the other limitations set forth herein. No Securityholder Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover for an indemnification claim under _Section
10.03(i)_ (Indemnification by Parent and the Surviving Company) unless, until
and only to the extent that any Securityholder Indemnified Party (individually
or collectively with all other Securityholder Indemnified Parties) has
suffered or incurred actual Damages aggregating in excess of the Deductible
Amount, whereupon any of the Securityholder Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to claim indemnification only for amounts in excess of the Deductible
Amount, subject to the other limitations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Deductible Amount shall not apply to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations or breaches of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 3.12_ (Tax Matters).

 



 

(c) _Indemnity Cap_. The aggregate liability of the Securityholder
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ , _Section
10.02(a)(vi)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ (Indemnification by the
Securityholders) for breaches of representations and warranties other than
Fundamental Representations or breaches of representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.12_ (Tax Matters) shall not exceed ten million dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Indemnity Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the above, no
Securityholder shall be required to make payments on account of claims for
indemnification under this Agreement (including from the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnification Escrow Funds) in excess of the total cash proceeds received by
such Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each Person providing indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ is also
referred to herein as an " _Indemnifying Party_ ," and each Person being
indemnified pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ is also referred to herein as an "
_Indemnified Party_." For purposes of determining the liability of any
Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE X_ for any Damages, appropriate
reductions shall be made to reflect the recovery pursuant to any insurance
policy actually received by any Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages,
net of expenses incurred by such Indemnified party in collecting such recovery
and any increases in premia resulting therefrom. If an indemnification payment
is received by any Indemnified Party, and such Indemnified Party later
actually receives insurance recoveries or Tax benefits (within the time period
specified), as described in the immediately preceding sentence, in respect of
the related Damages or indemnification payments that were not previously
accounted for with respect to such Damages or indemnification payments when
made, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, and
promptly, but in any event no later than five (5) days after delivery of such
notice by such Indemnified Party, pay (or cause the Escrow Agent to pay from
the Indemnification Escrow Funds) to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to
the lesser of (A) any such net insurance recoveries and Tax benefits (unless
such amounts were taken into account in calculating such Damages) and (B) the
actual amount of the indemnification payments previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Damages.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Article X_ shall limit the claims of any Party with respect
to fraudulent, criminal or intentional misconduct.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all monetary claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification set
forth in _Section 7.08(f)_ and this _ARTICLE X_. In furtherance of the
foregoing, but without limiting the rights of indemnification expressly
provided for under _Section 7.08(f)_ (Tax Indemnification), _Section 10.02_
(Indemnification by the Securityholders) and _Section 10.03_ (Indemnification
by Parent and the Surviving Company) (and subject to the other provisions of
this _ARTICLE X_ ), each Indemnified Party hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (including any right, whether arising at
Law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery,
damages or any other recourse or remedy, including the remedy of rescission
and remedies that may arise under common law) for monetary relief it may have
against any Indemnifying Party whether arising under or based upon any
federal, state, local or foreign Law (including any Environmental
Requirements) or otherwise. Nothing in this _Section 10.05_ shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which such Person
shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any partys fraudulent,
criminal or intentional misconduct.

 



 

Section 10.06 _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party arising from a claim of a third party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party

 



       
 

 



 

in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of
the Third-Party Claim; provided that failure or delay to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



 

The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim and, if it elects, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, in each case, at its own expense
with regard to fees, costs, and expenses associated with such defense, so long
as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within
fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third-Party
Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party will have the financial resources to defend against the Third-Party
Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the Third-
Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief, and (iv) the Third-Party Claim does not relate to or
arise in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; provided, however, that with respect to
indemnification for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties, the right
of any Securityholder Indemnifying Party to participate in or control the
defense of a Third-Party Claim shall not apply after the Deductible Amount and
the Indemnification Escrow Funds are exhausted.

 



 

Should an Indemnifying Party elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense; provided, however, that if there exists a conflict
of interest (including the availability of one or more legal defenses to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party) that
would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to retain one
counsel (plus one local counsel in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified
Party determines counsel is necessary), reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, provided that
the Indemnified Party will contest such Third-Party Claims in good faith.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE X_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party
has elected not to assume the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend a Third-Party Claim, each Party shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making personnel available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. No
compromise or settlement of any Third-

 



      
 

 



 

Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that no such consent shall be required if (i) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party and no
effect on any other claims that may be made against such Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates and (ii) each Indemnified Party that is party to such Third-
Party Claim is fully and unconditionally released from liability with respect
to such claim. No Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise any Third-Party
Claim without the express prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
unless the Indemnified Party waives its rights to indemnification hereunder
with respect to such Third-Party Claim; provided that it shall be reasonable
for the Indemnifying Party to withhold any such consent if such settlement or
compromise affects any claims that are then pending or threatened, or may be
made, against such Indemnifying Party.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall have the right to control the defense, compromise and settlement
of the Special Litigation. No compromise or settlement of the Special
Litigation (a " _Special Litigation Settlement_ ") shall be binding on the
Securityholders for purposes of their indemnification obligations under this
Article X without the Sellers Representatives consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that if Sellers
Representative does not so consent (regardless of whether it does so
reasonably or unreasonably), then the Damages payable by the Securityholders
pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(vi)_ with respect to the Special Litigation
Settlement shall be determined by the mutual agreement of Parent and the
Sellers Representative after negotiations in good faith or, failing such
agreement, pursuant to arbitration in accordance with _Section 11.16_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate amount of the cash payments to
be made by Parent or the Surviving Company as part of the Special Litigation
Settlement is greater than 200% of the aggregate amount of Indemnity Escrow
Funds that will be released to pay the Special Litigation Settlement pursuant
to this _Article X_ , then the Special Litigation Settlement shall be binding
on, and indemnifiable by, the Securityholders for all purposes of this
_Article X_ even if consent of the Sellers Representative is not obtained.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Securityholders or the Sellers
Representative shall have any right to prevent or inhibit Parent or the
Surviving Company from defending, compromising or settling the Special
Litigation.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Procedures for Inter-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of such claim, the nature and basis
of the alleged breach giving rise to such claim and all relevant facts and
circumstances relating thereto. Failure of delay in notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party or its
indemnification obligations, except, and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that such failure or delay has materially
harmed the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The Indemnified
Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to its books
and records during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior written
notice for the purpose of allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable
opportunity to verify any such claim for Damages. The Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party within forty-five (45) days following its receipt
of such notice and granting of such access if the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party

 



      
 

 



 

under this _ARTICLE X_. If the Indemnifying Party does not so notify the
Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the Indemnifying Party under
this _ARTICLE X_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall pay (or, if applicable,
cause the Escrow Agent to pay from the Indemnification Escrow Funds) the
amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of
any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim as provided above,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve such dispute. Following the final determination of the amount of
Damages to which the Indemnified Party is entitled (whether determined in
accordance with this _Section 10.07_ or by arbitration), the Indemnifying
Party shall pay (or, if applicable, cause the Escrow Agent to pay from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds) such Damages to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer or certified check made payable to the order of the Indemnified
Party. Where the provisions of this _ARTICLE X_ conflict with the provisions
of _Section 7.08(i)_ , the provisions of _Section 7.08(i)_ shall control.

 



 

Section 10.08 _Duty to Mitigate_. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or otherwise reduce the amount of any Damages
that it incurs in connection with any matter with respect to which it is
entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant
to this _ARTICLE X_ , including, without limitation, taking commercially
reasonable measures to attempt to recover from any third parties alleged to be
responsible for such Damages and any insurance proceeds available to offset
such Damages under insurance policies maintained by the Indemnified Party, and
any such insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified Party shall
be offset against the amount of Damages to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_. The costs and expenses of such
mitigation efforts shall be included in the Indemnified Partys Damages for
which the Indemnified Party will become entitled to be held harmless,
indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_.

 



 

Section 10.09 _Knowledge_. No right of indemnification under this _ARTICLE X_
shall be limited by any reason of any investigation or audit conducted before
or after the Closing or the knowledge of any party acquired at any time of any
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by any other party
at any time, or the decision of any party to complete the Closing (other than
with respect to a Material Update).

 



 

Section 10.10 _No Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable to or otherwise responsible for
punitive damages, except to the extent that such punitive damages were
actually paid by such Person to a third party.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ shall be treated by the Parties, for
federal income Tax and other applicable Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the
cash proceeds received by the Securityholders in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Materiality_. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages
incurred out of or relating to any breach of a representation or warranty and
for determining whether or

 



      
 

 



 

not a breach has occurred, all references to "Material Adverse Effect",
"material" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative terms),
including as expressed in accounting concepts such as GAAP, shall be
disregarded.

 



 

Section 10.13 _No Contribution_. No Securityholder Indemnified Party shall
have or exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert) any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Parent or
the Target Companies in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which he, she or it may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 11.01 _Sellers  Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Target Companies hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and
appoints the Sellers Representative as the agent, agent for service of
process and true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Securityholders, with full
power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of such
Securityholder with respect to this Agreement and the taking by the Sellers
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken or made by the Sellers Representative under this
Agreement including the exercise of the power to: (i) execute, deliver,
acknowledge, certify and file (in the name of any or all of the
Securityholders or otherwise) any and all documents, including, without
limitation, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and to take any and all
actions, and make all payments and disbursements, that the Sellers
Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate in connection with any matter covered in _Section
2.08_ (Post Closing Adjustment), _Section 2.11_ (Reserve Account) or any
indemnification claim under _ARTICLE X_ (Indemnification) (including
negotiating, entering into compromises or settlements of and demanding
arbitration with respect to any such matters covered in _Section 2.08_ (Post
Closing Adjustment) _Section 2.11_ (Reserve Account) or any indemnification
claim, as applicable); (ii) update the _Schedule 1.1_ as contemplated herein;
(iii) give and receive notices and communications under this Agreement and the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement; and (iv) take such actions as the Board of
Directors or Board of Managers, as applicable, under the organizational
documents of the Target Companies would be permitted to take (subject to the
terms of such organizational documents as they exist immediately prior to
Closing). The Sellers Representative hereby accepts its appointment as the
Sellers Representative.

 



 

(b) The power of attorney granted in this _Section 11.01_ (i) is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Sellers
Representative; and (iii) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution or
liquidation of each of the Securityholders.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers Representative
on all matters relating to _Section 2.08_ (Post Closing Adjustment) and the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and each Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers Representative on all matters
relating to _ARTICLE X_ (Indemnification), and each of them shall

 



      
 

 



 

be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Securityholder by the Sellers Representative, and on any other action
taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Securityholder by the Sellers
Representative, as fully binding upon such Securityholder.

 



 

(d) The Sellers Representative may at any time designate a replacement
Sellers Representative and each Securityholder, by virtue of his, her or its
receipt of the Aggregate Consideration provided for by this Agreement, shall
be deemed to have consented to such replacement Sellers Representative. If
the Sellers Representative shall dissolve or liquidate or otherwise become
unable to fulfill its responsibilities as representative of the
Securityholders, then the Securityholders shall, by "majority vote" within
thirty (30) days after such dissolution, liquidation or other event, appoint a
successor representative. After any such replacement or appointment of a
successor pursuant to this _Section 11.01_ , the replacing party shall provide
prompt written notice thereof to Parent. Until such notice is received by
Parent, Parent will be entitled to rely on the actions of the previous
Sellers Representative. Any such replacement or successor shall become the
"Sellers Representative" for purposes of this Agreement. If for any reason
there is no Sellers Representative at any time, all references herein to the
Sellers Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Securityholders.

 



 

(e) No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative. The Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to any Securityholder for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment with respect to any
matter arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of its duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith). The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to be indemnified by the
Securityholders, on a joint and several basis, for any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the Sellers Representative with respect to any matter arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder. The
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to recover from the Securityholders,
on a joint and several basis, any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Sellers Representative in good faith and in connection with
actions taken by the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement
(including the hiring of accountants and legal counsel and the incurring of
accounting and legal fees and costs). The Sellers Representative shall keep
reasonably detailed records of the costs and expenses for which it seeks
reimbursement as herein provided.

 



 

Section 11.02 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section
7.08(f)_ (Tax Indemnification), _Section 10.02_ (Indemnification by the
Securityholders) and _Section 10.03_ (Indemnification by Parent and the
Surviving Company), this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 11.03 _Equitable Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, prior to the Closing, the Parties agree that in the event any Party
hereto violates any provisions of this Agreement, the remedies at Law with
respect to such violation may be inadequate. In such event, the Parties shall
have the right, in addition to all other rights and remedies they may have,

 



      
 

 



 

to specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce
or prevent any violations by one or more Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules (including Disclosure Schedules), and the documents referred to
herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

 



 

Section 11.05 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned (i) by
any Party other than Parent without the prior written consent of Parent or
(ii) by Parent without the written consent of the Sellers Representative,
except that (a) Parent may assign its right to purchase Units hereunder in
whole or in part to Guarantor or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, and (b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company may
assign their rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part
through a collateral assignment to any lender which provides financing in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 11.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any
amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of digital
imaging and electronic mail or a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person.

 



 

Section 11.07 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.08 _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, waivers and other
communications hereunder must be in writing and will be deemed to have been
duly given only if delivered personally against written receipt, delivered by
facsimile transmission against facsimile confirmation, mailed by prepaid first

Section 11.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Each Party irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or the state courts of
Delaware in respect of any disputes or claims under _Section 7.03_
(Confidentiality) or with respect to which a party otherwise seeks equitable
remedies pursuant to _Section 11.03_ (Equitable Remedies). Each Party further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such Partys respective address set forth in _Section
11.08_ (Notices) above shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 11.10_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of the matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction in this _Section 11.10_ in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware or the state courts of Delaware, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment, waiver or modification
of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by Parent and the Sellers Representative, or in the case
of a waiver by Parent or Sellers Representative, as the case may be, by the
party waiving compliance. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, covenant or agreement
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and
Schedules (including Disclosure Schedules) identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Construction_. Where specific language is used to clarify by
example a general statement contained herein, such specific language shall not
be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the
general statement to which it relates. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Party.

requires, (i) words of any gender include each other gender or the neuter;
(ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or
singular number, respectively; (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby"
and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement; (iv) the terms
"Article" or "Section" refer to the specified Article or Section of this
Agreement and (v) the word "including" means "including without limitation."

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.15 _Disclosure Schedules_. The information set forth in each
section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement (the "
_Disclosure Schedules_ ") shall be deemed to provide the information
contemplated by, or otherwise qualify, the representations and warranties of
the Target Companies, VMG General Partner, VMG and VMG Tax-Exempt LP set forth
in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement and any other
section or subsection of this Agreement, if it could reasonably be concluded
that such information applies to such other section or subsection of this
Agreement and regardless of whether such section or subsection of this
Agreement is qualified by reference to the Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

Section 11.16 _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) Except for disputes and claims under _Section 7.03_ (Confidentiality) or
with respect to which a party otherwise seeks equitable remedies pursuant to
_Section 11.03_ (Equitable Remedies) (which may be pursued in a court of
competent jurisdiction as provided in _Section 11.10_ (Consent to
Jurisdiction)), and disputes under _Section 2.08_ (Post Closing Adjustment),
_Section 7.08(a)_ (Purchase Price Allocation) and _Section 7.08(k)_ (Dispute
Resolution) (which disputes shall be governed by the provisions of such
Sections), each party agrees that arbitration administered by the American
Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules
(the " _AAA Rules_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
claim or dispute (" _Claim_ ") based on, arising out of, or relating to the
rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, whether such Claim
arose or the facts on which such Claim is based occurred prior to or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Parties hereto agree that (i) one arbitrator shall be appointed
pursuant to the AAA Rules to conduct any such arbitration, (ii) such
arbitrator shall have at least fifteen (15) years of experience whether as an
attorney or as a neutral arbitrator with respect to equity purchase agreements
and complex commercial contracts, and (iii) all meetings of the Parties and
all hearings with respect to any such arbitration shall take place in New
York, New York.

 



 

(c) In addition, the Parties hereto agree that (i) the arbitrator shall have
no authority to make any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (as executed and delivered by the Parties hereto), (ii) the
arbitrator shall have no greater authority to award any relief than a court
having proper jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 11.10_ (Consent to
Jurisdiction) and (iii) the arbitrator shall have no authority to commit an
Error of Law (as defined below) in his or her decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination, and on appeal from or motion to vacate
or confirm such decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination, a court having proper jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 11.10_
(Consent to Jurisdiction) may vacate any such decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination to the extent containing an Error of
Law. For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Error of Law_ " means any decision,
judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination that is inconsistent
with the laws governing this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.09_ (Governing
Law). Any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination of
the arbitrator and any information disclosed in the course of any arbitration
hereunder (collectively, the " _Arbitration Information_ ") shall be kept
confidential by the Parties subject to _Section 11.16(d)_ , and any appeal
from or motion to vacate or confirm such decision, judgment, ruling, finding,
award or other determination shall be filed under seal.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) In the event that any party or any of such partys Affiliates, associates
or representatives is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Arbitration
Information (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), such Disclosing Party shall notify
the other Parties promptly of the request or requirement so that the other
Parties may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 11.16_. If, in the absence of a protective order
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Disclosing Party or any of its
Affiliates, associates or representatives believes in good faith, upon the
advice of legal counsel, that it is compelled to disclose any such Arbitration
Information, such Disclosing Party may disclose such portion of the
Arbitration Information as it believes in good faith, upon the advice of legal
counsel, it is required to disclose; provided that the Disclosing Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of
the other Parties, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such portion of the Arbitration Information required to
be disclosed as the other Parties shall designate. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 11.16_ to the contrary, the Parties shall have no obligation to
keep confidential any Arbitration Information that becomes generally known to
and available for use by the public other than as a result of the disclosing
partys acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of such partys Affiliates,
associates or representatives. The Parties agree that, subject to the right of
any party to appeal or move to vacate or confirm any decision, judgment,
ruling, finding, award or other determination of an arbitration as provided in
this _Section 11.16_ , the decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination of any arbitration under the AAA Rules shall be final,
conclusive and binding on all of the Parties hereto; provided, however, that
nothing in this _Section 11.16_ shall prohibit any party hereto from
instituting litigation to enforce any final decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination of the arbitration.

 



 

Section 11.17 _Costs and Expenses_. In the event of any action for
indemnification arising under _ARTICLE X_ (Indemnification), the prevailing
party shall be entitled to, and the non-prevailing party shall pay to the
prevailing party, the costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of
legal counsel) incurred by the prevailing party in connection with enforcing
its rights or defending claims hereunder. In the event of any arbitration
pursuant to _Section 11.16_ (Arbitration), each party to the arbitration shall
bear its own costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of legal
counsel, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law), and all
costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding (such as filing fees, the
arbitrators fees, hearing expenses, etc.) shall be borne equally by the
parties to the arbitration; provided, however, that the arbitrator shall, in
the award, allocate all such costs and expenses against the non-prevailing
party. Any costs and expenses payable by any Securityholder Indemnifying Party
pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ (Indemnification) or _Section 11.16_ (Arbitration)
shall first be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, and thereafter,
directly from the Securityholder Indemnifying Party.

 



 

Section 11.18 _Guaranty_.

 



 

(a) Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary
obligor and not as surety, the due and punctual payment and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub (and any permitted assignees thereof) of all of their
obligations to the Target

 



       
 

 



 

Companies, VMG General Partner, VMG Tax-Exempt LP and the Sellers
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ ").

 



 

(b) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Target Companies, VMG General
Partner, VMG Tax-Exempt LP and the Sellers Representative that (i) it has
full organizational power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations under this _Section 11.18_ , (ii) the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Guarantor and the performance by Guarantor
of its obligations under this _Section 11.18_ have been duly authorized by all
requisite organizational action, and (iii) this _Section 11.18_ constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable in
accordance with its terms and conditions (except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally, or other equitable principles).

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Stock Purchase Agreement
and Agreement and Plan of Merger as of the date first written above.
