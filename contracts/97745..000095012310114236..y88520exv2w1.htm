ARTICLE I**

 

 **THE OFFER 

   

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than eight (8) Business Days following the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer. 

  

 (b) The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Time that number of Shares which, together with the Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of the total number of Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof)) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex A (together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ") (and shall not be subject to any other conditions). Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Time. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or to increase the Offer Price;  _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Annex A or otherwise impose any other condition to the Offer, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.1, extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Time_ "). 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to the parties respective rights to terminate this Agreement under Article VIII, if applicable, Merger Sub (i) may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived, until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii) shall extend the Offer for any period required by applicable Law, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Offer, and, for periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust, competition or similar Law set forth on Section 1.1(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (as it may be modified or supplemented as set forth therein) shall have expired or been terminated and (iii) to the extent requested by the Company on one or more occasions for periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer if on any then-scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived, until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived;  _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Merger Sub extend the Offer beyond June 12, 2011 unless, as of such date, all the Offer Conditions, other than the obtaining or achievement of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined in Annex A) and the condition set forth in section (a) of Annex A to the extent related to the HSR Act or any other antitrust, competition or similar Law, have been satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived, in which case such date shall be extended by ninety (90) days (such date, the " _End Date_ "). 

  

 (f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of an amount pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iii)) all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1). Acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions upon the Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_ ". Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the Offer for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents may, in Merger Subs sole discretion, provide for such a reservation of right. Nothing contained in this Section 1.1 shall affect any termination rights in Article VIII, as to the Agreement, or in Annex A, as to the Offer. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII.

The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement) furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and, immediately following such filing, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, together with, to the extent requested by the Company, the Schedule 14D-9, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.

Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and, immediately following such filing, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand and shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on any response and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. 

  

 (i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.  

  

 (a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-_  _9_ ") that shall, except as expressly provided in Section 5.3, contain the

stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by
the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and,
immediately following such filing, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments
or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and
Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between it and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand and shall
give the Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the response of the Company to those comments and to
provide comments on any response, and the Company shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC
or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall
give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board
Recommendation contained in the Schedule 14D-9. 

   

 (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement) furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub mailing labels, security position listings and any other available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such information and assistance (including lists of record holders or beneficial owners of the Shares, updated from time to time upon Parents, Merger Subs or any of their Representatives request, and the addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions of such record holders or beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Sub or any such Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial owners of the Shares. Such information shall be considered Confidential Information pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Directors_.  

  

 (a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including Shares accepted for payment) bears 

   ##### 

  

 

to the total number of Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall cause
Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of
the Company, including by increasing the number of directors, seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors and taking all actions
necessary in connection with accomplishing the foregoing, including amending
the Company Bylaws. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (A) each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company and (B) as requested by Parent, each board of directors (or
similar governing body) of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee
thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on
the Board of Directors of the Company. 

   

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions necessary to effect the appointment of Parents designees, including mailing to its stockholders information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(b), which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under Section 1.3(a) hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such information. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent (the " _Independent Directors_ ") shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors of the Company, (iii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, and (iv) any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.  

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.4, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a fully diluted basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof); _provided, however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Shares authorized and unissued or held in the treasury of the Company at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (giving effect to the Shares issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding Company Stock Options 

   ##### 

  

 

and Company RSUs and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if
such Shares were outstanding) and (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by any
Law or Order. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but
not in part, at any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier
to occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing) and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the aggregate purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company at Parents election, either (i) entirely in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by (A) paying in cash by wire transfer of same-day funds an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (B) issuing to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory Note shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing during the period in which any portion of the principal amount of such promissory note remains outstanding, as published by The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis on the outstanding principal amount of the Promissory Note from the date the Promissory Note is originally issued until the date of payment in full of the Promissory Note, and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. The Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by federal or state securities Laws. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ ") and that all such Top-Up Shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Parent Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 3.1(c) and 3.1(e), each issued and outstanding Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) any Shares held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which Shares shall remain outstanding, except that the number of such shares owned by any such subsidiary of the Company shall be adjusted in the Merger to maintain relative ownership percentages (as adjusted, the " _Remaining Shares_ "), (ii) any Cancelled Shares, and (iii) any Dissenting Shares, shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. 

  

 (d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001, of the Surviving Corporation and shall with the Remaining Shares constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or in the securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar transaction, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 3.1(e) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment for such Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 3.1(b), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the Dissenting Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares or the Promissory Note delivered by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the Top-Up Shares. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or another U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, immediately available 

   ##### 

  

 

funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (collectively, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such customary form and have such other customary provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent and Parent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or delivery of an "agents message" to the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in respect of Book-Entry Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in respect of the Shares represented by its Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (iii) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, including amounts payable to holders of Shares, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash shall be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or if such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred, as applicable, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or such 

   ##### 

  

 

Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article III. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 3.2(d). 

  

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options and Company RSUs; ESPP_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to acquire Shares granted under the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the Dionex Corporation Stock Option Plan (each a 

   ##### 

  

 

 _Company Stock Plan_ ") or otherwise that is outstanding and unexercised as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Stock Option_
"), (i) in the case of the Company Stock Options that are fully vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Vested Company Stock Options_
"), shall terminate and cease to represent a right to acquire Shares, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash equal
to the product of (x) the number of Shares that were purchasable upon
exercise of such Vested Company Stock Option and (y) the Offer Price less the
exercise price of such Vested Company Stock Option; and (ii) in the case of
the Company Stock Options that are not fully vested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Unvested Company Stock Options_ "), shall be
assumed by Parent and converted into an award (an " _Assumed Award_ ")
representing a right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares underlying the Unvested Company Stock Option that would have
become purchasable upon each future vesting date of such Unvested Company
Stock Option and (y) the Offer Price less the exercise price of such Unvested
Company Stock Option (the " _Assumed Award Offer Amount_ "). The right to
receive the Assumed Award Offer Amount in respect of an Assumed Award shall
be subject to the vesting terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and of
the award agreements evidencing the corresponding Unvested Company Stock
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such Assumed
Award Offer Amount shall be payable as soon as practicable following the
applicable vesting dates (but not later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter in any event); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) if the employment
or service of a holder of an unvested Assumed Award who is not an Eligible
Employee under the Companys Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan (the "
_CIC Plan_ ") is terminated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on or after
the Effective Time without Cause (as such term is defined in Section 3.3(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter), all then unvested Assumed Awards shall
immediately vest and the holder thereof shall be paid the Assumed Award Offer
Amount in respect of such Assumed Awards as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter (and, subject to Section 3.3(c) below, no later than ten (10)
Business Days thereafter); or (B) if the employment of a holder of an Assumed
Award who is an Eligible Employee under the CIC Plan is terminated by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries under circumstances that constitute a Covered
Termination (as defined in the CIC Plan), all then unvested Assumed Awards
shall immediately vest and the holder thereof shall be paid the Assumed Award
Offer Amount in respect of such Assumed Awards as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Covered Termination (and, subject to Section 3.3(c)
below, no later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter). For purposes of
clarity, with respect to any Assumed Awards held by a member of the Companys
Board of Directors as of the date hereof who does not become a member of the
Parents Board of Directors as of the Effective Time, as a result of his or
her cessation of service as of the Effective Time, the Assumed Award shall
immediately vest and such director shall be entitled to be paid the Assumed
Award Offer Amount as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (but no
later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any event). 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each award of restricted stock units denominated in Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan or otherwise that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Company RSU_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an award (an " _Assumed RSU_ ") representing a right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares that would have been delivered to the holder on each future vesting date of such Company RSU (or on each future delivery date of such Company RSU, if such 

   ##### 

   

 

delivery date is later than the related vesting date) and (y) the Offer Price
(the " _Assumed RSU Offer Amount_ "), and such Assumed RSU Offer Amount shall
be payable as soon as practicable after the applicable vesting date or
delivery date (but not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any
event). The right to receive any Assumed RSU Offer Amount in respect of
Assumed RSUs shall be subject to the vesting and delivery terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan and of the award agreements evidencing the
corresponding Company RSU as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , (A) that the performance metrics
relating to Company RSUs that are subject to the achievement of such
performance metrics (such Company RSUs, the " _Company Performance RSUs_ ")
shall be deemed to have been achieved at target as of the Effective Time with
the number of Company Performance RSUs and the related number of Assumed RSUs
to be fixed on the Effective Time at the Target Stock Unit Amount (as set
forth in the applicable award agreement) and all other vesting terms of such
Assumed RSUs that were originally Company Performance RSUs shall remain
the same; (B) that the Assumed RSUs that were originally Company Performance
RSUs shall vest, subject to the continuous employment of the applicable
employee through each vesting date, as follows: 50% of the Assumed RSUs that
were originally Company Performance RSUs shall vest on August 3, 2012; 25% of
the Assumed RSUs that were originally Company Performance RSUs shall vest on
August 3, 2013; and 25% of the Assumed RSUs that were originally outstanding
Company Performance RSUs shall vest on August 3, 2014; and (C) that if the
employment or service of a holder of unvested Assumed RSUs (including those
that were originally Company Performance RSUs at target, as fixed above) (I)
who is not an Eligible Employee under the CIC Plan is terminated by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time without Cause (as such
term is defined in Section 3.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), all then
unvested Assumed RSUs shall immediately vest and the holder thereof shall be
paid the Assumed RSU Offer Amount as soon as practicable thereafter (and,
subject to Section 3.3(c) below, no later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter) or (II) who is an Eligible Employee under the CIC Plan, is
terminated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under circumstances that
constitute a Covered Termination (as defined in the CIC Plan), all then
unvested Assumed RSUs shall immediately vest and the holder thereof shall be
paid the Assumed RSU Offer Amount as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Covered Termination (and, subject to Section 3.3(c) below, no later than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter). For purposes of clarity, with respect to any
Assumed RSUs held by a member of the Companys Board of Directors as of the
date hereof who does not become a member of the Parents Board of Directors
as of the Effective Time, as a result of his or her cessation of service as
of the Effective Time, the Assumed RSU shall immediately vest and such
director shall be entitled to be paid the Assumed RSU Offer Amount as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter (but no later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter in any event). 

   

 (c) Cash payments made pursuant to Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) above (i) shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 4(f) and 5(g) of the CIC Plan (with respect to the  application of Sections 409A and 280G of the Code, respectively) as if such provisions were incorporated into this Agreement, (ii) to the extent payable as a result of a termination of employment, shall be subject to the holders execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of the Company, and (iii) shall not serve as an offset to or otherwise reduce the severance benefits that a holder of the right to the cash payments in respect of the Assumed Awards and Assumed RSUs as provided by Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) may be entitled to receive from Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with the termination of such holders employment 

   ##### 

  

 

with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall take all necessary
actions to cause each Eligible Employee under the CIC Plan to acknowledge the
treatment pursuant to this Section 3.3 of Vested Company Stock Options,
Unvested Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, in each case, that such
Eligible Employee holds as of the Effective Time, and the effectiveness of
the modifications to Section 4(d) of the CIC Plan shall be conditioned upon
the Eligible Employees delivery of such acknowledgment and the restrictive
covenant agreement described in Section 4(d) of the CIC Plan. 

   

 (d) The Company shall (i) suspend the Companys 2003 Employee Stock Participation Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) ensure that no new offering periods under the Company ESPP will commence during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (iii) ensure that there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the participants under the Company ESPP during the current offering period, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that already are in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and (iv) ensure that no individuals shall commence participation in the Company ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time. The accumulated contributions of the participants in the current ESPP offering shall be used to purchase Shares within five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and the participants purchase rights under the ongoing offering shall terminate immediately after such purchase. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the ESPP. 

  

 (e) The Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the Vested Stock Options, Assumed Awards and Assumed RSUs with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Law, and the Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, make any required filings with and payments to the applicable Governmental Entity relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Vested Company Stock Options, Assumed Awards or Assumed RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (f) The Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take any necessary actions to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3. The Company and Parent agree that, prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan shall be amended to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of options, restricted stock units or other awards thereunder on or after the Offer Closing Date. The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs or otherwise.

 (c) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any state of facts, circumstance, event, change, effect or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with all other facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, or occurrences, (1) is materially adverse to the business, results of operation or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) renders the Company incapable of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the End Date; _provided, however_ , that, in the case of clause (1) only, no facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects or occurrences to the extent resulting from or arising out of the following shall be deemed, either alone or in combination to constitute, and no facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects or occurrences to the extent resulting from or arising out of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would be, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) changes after the date hereof in the economic, business, financial, technological or regulatory environment generally affecting the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declared or undeclared acts of war or terrorism or

 (g) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (" _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), (ii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan and (iii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. 

  

 (h) Each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is either (i) funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) self-insured and the Company has sufficient reserves to pay run out claims if such Company Benefit Plan is terminated. 

  

 (i) All contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof with respect to each Company Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or, to the extent not required to be paid, accrued in accordance with GAAP. 

  

 (j) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in connection with which the Company or its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to be subject to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a material Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code. There are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto which would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether insured or uninsured. 

  

 (k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) entitle any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance or termination pay, except as may be required by applicable Law, (ii) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as may be required by applicable Law, or (iii) result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise. 

   

 (l) All Company Stock Options have been granted in compliance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plans, with applicable Law, and with the applicable provisions of the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as in effect at the applicable time, and all such Company Stock Options are accurately disclosed in all material respects as required under applicable Law in (i) the Filed SEC Documents, including the financial statements contained therein or attached thereto (if amended or superseded by a filing with the SEC made prior to the date of this Agreement, as so amended or superseded), and (ii) the Tax Returns of the Company. In addition, the Company has not issued any Company Stock Options or any other similar equity awards pertaining to Shares under any Company Benefit Plan with an exercise price that is less than the "fair market value" of the underlying shares on the date of grant, as determined for financial accounting purposes under GAAP. 

  

 (m) All Company Benefit Plans subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been established, maintained and administered in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Laws, (ii) if they are required to be registered have been registered and if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and applicable Law. 

  

 (n) Each individual who currently renders services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and who is classified by the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor or other non-employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and exclusion from participation under the Company Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized, except to the extent that any potential mischaracterization of such an independent contractor or other non-employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries would not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (o) The parties hereto acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to employment, compensation, severance and other Company Benefit Plans or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including Sections 3.3, 6.5 and 6.9 (collectively, the " _Arrangements_ ") to certain holders of Shares and other securities of the Company (the " _Covered Stockholders_ "). Payments and grants under the Arrangements (i) are being paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Stockholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) are not calculated based on the number of Shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered Stockholder. The adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each

Arrangement has been approved as an employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.3(a) or (b), in the event that, prior to the Offer Closing, the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this Section 6.3, and that, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, it may, subject to compliance with Section 6.3(d), prior to the Offer Closing, take the following actions (but only if and to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation 

   ##### 

  

 

with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to cause it to breach or violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
law): (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such _bona fide_ written
Alternative Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with

discussions or negotiations with, and only with, such Person and its
Representatives regarding such _bona fide_ written Alternative Proposal;

determined to take such actions and the Company shall simultaneously provide
or make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company

fide_ written Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent. The Company shall not, and
shall not cause or permit its Subsidiaries or Representatives to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement relating to or in connection with an
Alternative Proposal with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
except for a customary confidentiality agreement pursuant to clause (i) above
of this Section 6.3(c), and neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives, has entered into any agreement relating to or in
connection with an Alternative Proposal prior to the date hereof, and the
Company shall not, and shall not cause or permit its Subsidiaries or
Representatives to, enter into any agreement relating to or in connection with
an Alternative Proposal following the date hereof, that would prevent the
Company from providing any information to Parent as contemplated by this
Agreement. 

   

 (d) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal, and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding an Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the Person making any such Alternative Proposal or indication, inquiry or request and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or indication, inquiry or request (including copies of any document or correspondence evidencing such Alternative Proposal or indication, inquiry or request). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any such Alternative Proposal or indication, inquiry or request. 

  

 (e) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Recommendation or (ii) make any public statement in connection with the Company Meeting, or in reference to an Alternative Proposal, that is inconsistent with the Recommendation (any action or public statement described in clause (i) or (ii) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), or (iii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than any customary confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to clause (i) above of Section 6.3(c)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Alternative Proposal (A) in each case, unless it concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the failure to do so would be 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably likely to cause it to breach or violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and subject to the requirement that (1) the Company shall
have complied in all material respects with this Section 6.3, given Parent
and Merger Sub prompt written notice advising them of the decision of the
Board of Directors of the Company to take such action and, in the event that
such decision relates to an Alternative Proposal, such Alternative Proposal
shall have been an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Proposal that
did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this Section 6.3
and that in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the
Company constitutes a Superior Proposal, and the Company shall have included
in such notice the material terms and conditions of the Alternative Proposal,
including the identity of the person making any such Alternative Proposal and
copies of any document or correspondence evidencing such Alternative Proposal
and (2) in the event that such decision relates to an Alternative Proposal:
(x) the Company shall have given Parent and Merger Sub three (3) Business
Days after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement (or make another proposal) and if Parent and Merger Sub propose to
revise the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal), the Company
shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its financial and legal advisors
to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal and (y) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations
and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed
to by Parent and Merger Sub, if any, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) in the case of any action
contemplated by clause (iii) above, unless the Company shall have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including the
payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2. In the event
the Board of Directors of the Company does not make the determination
referred to in the preceding clause (A)(2)(y) of this paragraph and
thereafter determines to effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to this
Section 6.3(e), the procedures referred to above shall apply anew and shall
also apply to any subsequent Change of Recommendation. Following each and
every material revision to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall
be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply
with the requirements of this Section 6.3(e) with respect to such new written
notice, except that the three (3) Business Day period referred to above shall
be reduced to two (2) days (one (1) of which must be a Business Day). 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; and _provided, further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Recommendation. 

  

 (g) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

   

 (i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " with respect to the Company, shall mean any of the following transactions: (i) any transaction or series of related transactions with one or more third Persons involving: (A) any

or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any sale, lease

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation thereafter (the " _Company Employees_ ") will be offered participation and coverage under Parents and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for these purposes, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) compensation and benefit plans that are substantially similar to the plans generally in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "); _provided_ , that continued participation and coverage following the Effective Time under the benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to satisfy the obligations under this sentence, it being understood that the Company Employees may commence participating in the comparable Parent Benefit Plans on different dates following the Effective Time with respect to different comparable Parent Benefit Plans. 

  

 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (including any such plans that are Company Benefits Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of any New Plan under which similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (iii) for purposes of any New Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or (iv) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent legally permissible, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, (x) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) to the extent information is provided to Parent in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and its plan administrator, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the Old Plans plan year ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan, for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket and life-time maximum limitations or requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor all obligations under the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending, suspending or terminating any particular Company Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms and applicable Law. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5, the provisions of Sections 6.5(a), (b) and (c) shall apply only with respect to Company Employees who are covered under Company Benefit Plans that are maintained primarily for the benefit of employees of the Company employed in the United States (including Company Employees regularly employed outside the United States to the extent they participate in such Company Benefit Plans). With respect to Company Employees not described in the preceding sentence, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable Laws relating to employees and employee benefits matters applicable to such employees. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and to ensure that the account balances of the participants in the Company 401(k) Plan are fully vested upon such plan termination, in each case effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall take the action necessary (including the amendment of Parents 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ")) to permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed to roll over any eligible rollover distributions into Parents 401(k) Plan. The Company Employees shall be eligible immediately as of the Effective Time to participate in Parents 401(k) Plan. 

  

 (f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any event prior to the Offer Closing Date), the Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, take all action necessary to fulfill all consultation and notification requirements, and obtain all approvals from, any unions, works councils or other labor organizations, whether required pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise. Any written or oral communications to the employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that relate to or are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be previously approved in writing by Parent, it being agreed that Parent and the Company shall cooperate, including by providing Parent a reasonable period of time to review and approve any such communication, in providing any such mutually agreeable communication. 

  

 (g) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer, employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other 

   ##### 

  

 

compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any purpose, (ii) guarantee employment for any period of
time, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its

Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company
Benefit Plan, employee benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the

efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting

the HSR Act review, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
other in (x) determining whether any filings are required or advisable, in

parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) promptly making all such filings and

promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all other actions and do, or cause
to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to
resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice, or competition authorities of any other jurisdiction for which, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent, consents, permits, authorizations,
waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting
periods are required or advisable with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any

its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, product
lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other Order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying the Offer Closing or
the Closing or delaying the Offer Closing beyond the End Date, _provided_
that the Company will only be required to take or commit to take any such
action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action,
commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company only
in the event the Offer Closing occurs. 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.

filings with, any Governmental Entity, and confer in good faith to resolve
any disagreement as to their strategy for communicating with any Governmental
Entity or third party regarding any Regulatory Law. Each of the Company and
Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in

Offer and/or the Merger, the fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith, and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Debt
Financing_ ") (it being understood that the receipt of such Debt Financing is
not a condition to the Offer or the Merger), including: (i) participating
in meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions and (ii) assisting with
the preparation of materials for presentations, memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the Companys
business or (B) require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to
the Effective Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed or
simultaneously indemnified and (y) any documentation executed by the Company
of any of its Subsidiaries shall not become effective until the consummation

Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and by-laws or   #####

Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or
employees in effect as of the date hereof, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time
were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim.

 (c) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six years following the Effective Time directors and officers liability insurance with a Best rated "A" or better carrier, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage (including the scope and amount thereof) as, and contain terms and conditions that are equivalent to, the coverage set forth in the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the " _Current Policy_ "), and may, at the Surviving Corporations option, be in the form of a "tail" policy; _provided_ that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.9(c), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay more than 250% of the current annual policy premium.

The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper 

   ##### 

  

 

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.9. The agreements and covenants contained herein
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which
any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 Section 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. The Company shall take such steps as may be necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

   ##### 

  

 

the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $65,000,000 in cash (the
" _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion;
_provided, however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 8.2(a), all
references to "15%" in the definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall be
deemed to refer to "50%" instead. 

   

 (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) or clause (iii)(A) of Section 8.2(a) shall be made to Parent promptly following the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummation of any transaction contemplated by, any Alternative Proposal (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); and any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) or clause (iii)(B) of Section 8.2(a) shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this Agreement (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); _provided_ that in the event that any payment is required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.2(a) in connection with a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h), the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent at the same time as such termination. Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent. 

   

 (c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in this Section 8.2. In the event that the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable under this Section 8.2, then (1) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount, and (2) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made plus three percent (3%).

Annex A 

   

Conditions to the Offer 

  

 Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 12, 2010 (the " _Agreement_ "), among Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Weston D Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Dionex Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in this Annex A shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) the rights and obligations of Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer (subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement), Merger Sub (i) shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Merger Sub to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), pay for, or may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any tendered Shares and (ii) may terminate or amend the Offer as to Shares not then paid for, in the event that at the then-scheduled Expiration Time (as it may be extended pursuant to Section 1.1(e) of the Agreement) or immediately prior to such payment, (A) any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated, or any regulatory approval set forth or referenced in Sections 4.4(b)(iii) or 4.4(b)(v)(A), or Sections 5.2(b)(iii), 5.2(b)(iv) or 5.2(b)(v) of the Agreement which in the reasonable judgment of Parent is required or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, shall not have been obtained or shall not remain in full force and effect (or any statutory waiting period in respect thereof shall not have expired) (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting periods, including under the HSR Act, being referred to as the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), or any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall have resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Condition, (B) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied or (C) any of the following shall have occurred: 

   

 (a) (i) any restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order or similar legal restraint or prohibition shall have been issued by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and shall then be in effect, or (ii) any suit, action or other proceeding shall have been instituted by any Governmental Entity and shall remain pending that would reasonably be expected to result in a restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order or similar legal restraint or prohibition, in the case of either clause "(i)" or "(ii)" preventing the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and/or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 4.1 solely as such section relates to the Company, Section 4.2(a) (except to a _de minimis_ extent) Section 4.2(b) (except to a _de minimis_ extent), Section 4.4(a) and Section 4.21 of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though made at and as of such time (unless any such representation or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which case as of such specific date) or (ii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though made at and as of such time (unless any such representation or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which case as of such specific date), except in the case of the foregoing clause (ii), where the failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (c) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material respects with all of the Companys covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with by it prior to such time; 

   

 (d) since the date of the Agreement, any fact, circumstance, event, change, effect or occurrence shall have occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (e) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or another senior executive officer of the Company, dated as of the then-scheduled Expiration Time, certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (b) and (c) of this Annex A do not exist; or 

   

 (f) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

    

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub. The failure or delay by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
