<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December&nbsp;12, 2010 (the
&#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), among Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., a Delaware corporation
(&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), Weston D Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;), and Dionex Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms that are used but not otherwise defined in this Annex A shall
have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Offer, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) the rights and obligations
of Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer (subject to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement), Merger Sub (i)&nbsp;shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule&nbsp;14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to the obligation of Merger Sub to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), pay for, or may delay the acceptance for payment of or,
subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any tendered Shares and (ii)&nbsp;may
terminate or amend the Offer as to Shares not then paid for, in the event that at the
then-scheduled Expiration Time (as it may be extended pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.1(e) of the Agreement)
or immediately prior to such payment, (A)&nbsp;any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the HSR
Act shall not have expired or been terminated, or any regulatory approval set forth or referenced
in Sections&nbsp;4.4(b)(iii) or 4.4(b)(v)(A), or Sections&nbsp;5.2(b)(iii), 5.2(b)(iv) or 5.2(b)(v) of the
Agreement which in the reasonable judgment of Parent is required or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, shall not have
been obtained or shall not remain in full force and effect (or any statutory waiting period in
respect thereof shall not have expired) (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting
periods, including under the HSR Act, being referred to as the &#147;<U>Requisite Regulatory
Approvals</U>&#148;), or any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall have resulted in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Condition, (B)&nbsp;the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied or (C)&nbsp;any of the following shall have occurred:

legal restraint or prohibition shall have been issued by any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction and shall then be in effect, or (ii)&nbsp;any suit, action or other proceeding shall have
been instituted by any Governmental Entity and shall remain pending that would reasonably be
expected to result in a restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order or
