referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." Transferred Employees shall be
given the same benefits and right to benefits as Buyer's other employees
depending on their status as full time or part time and classification as to
exempt or non-exempt. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Transferred Employee any right with respect to continued employment with the
Buyer, nor shall anything herein limit or interfere with the Buyer's right to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time (subject to
applicable law), with or without cause or notice, or restrict the Buyer in the
exercise of independent business judgment in modifying any terms or conditions
of employment of the Transferred Employees on and after the Closing Date,

for participation, vesting, and benefit accrual) maintained by the Selling
Companies; provided that such crediting of service shall not operate to

Buyer not otherwise available under the terms of such plan. (c) Selling
Companies and Buyer agree that Buyer shall accept responsibility for the
Transferred Employees' vacation obligations owed by Seller to the Transferred
Employees after Closing. Buyer explicitly consents to the assumption of the
liability for the accrued but unused vacation balances as of Closing Date of

Closing. Any transferred vacation balances for employees that elect not to
accept employment with Buyer shall be accounted for in the True-Up, pursuant
to Section 2.5. Transferred Employees shall be entitled to the standard paid
time off and sick time pursuant to Buyer's plans and policies. In the event
that any Transferred Employee is currently entitled to a higher annual
vacation accrual under the plan offered by the applicable Selling Company than
currently offered pursuant to the Buyer's plan, the Buyer shall honor the
higher annual vacation accrual with respect to such Transferred Employee to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. (d) No assets or Liabilities of any
Plan will be transferred to the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer, provided
that Buyer shall allow its retirement plan, if any, to accept a "direct
rollover" of the account balances of the Transferred Employees, if such
rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law and plan terms by any
such Transferred Employee, including any 401(k) loan. (e) Selling Companies

shall enter into an employment or compensation agreement with the Buyer (the
"Employment Agreements"): Ashley Bush, Brian Cooper, Michael Oakes, William
McAfee, Ronda McAfee, William Witt, Sylvia Smith-Turk, Robert Chad Felix and
Don Booher (herein together the "Key Employees"). With the exception of Sylvia
Smith-Turk and Ronda McAfee, who will each have one-year term employment
agreements, the employment agreements will be for a three-year term with
corresponding non-compete and non-solicit/non-hire restrictive covenants. The
provisions of these restrictive covenants shall be contained in The Key
Employees' Employment Agreements. Buyer covenants that until the post-closing
negotiations set forth in Section 7.1 have been concluded/resolved/consummated
(and for 60 days thereafter), it will not enforce the non-competition
provisions of this Section 5.8 against Brian Cooper with respect to his
indirect partial ownership in Guaranteed Title Group, LLC, an affiliate
business arrangement. Buyer also covenants that it will not enforce or attempt
to enforce the non-competition provisions in this Section 5.8 against William
or Rhonda McAfee with respect to their ownership in Short Sale Solutions or
Pikes Peak School of Real Estate during the term of any employment agreement
between Buyer and these employees. (b) Restrictive Covenants. Selling
Companies, ET CO, ET WY, Dwyer and Willis, for a period of three (3) years
after the Closing Date ("Restricted Period") agree not to (i) solicit, attempt
to hire or hire, directly or indirectly, any of the Transferred Employees; or
(ii) participate in, open, own, direct, work for, run or otherwise compete
with Buyer in the title insurance, escrow, closing and settlement services
business ("Competing Business") in counties in which the Businesses operate,
as identified on Schedule 5.8(b) (the "Restricted Areas"); provided, however,
Selling Companies shall not be prohibited from acquiring a 5% or less
ownership interest in a public company that operates or has ownership in a
Competing Business and Buyer acknowledges the existence of the Thomas Title
Division of Empire West Title Agency, LLC ("Thomas Title"), a primarily
commercial based title business located in the Scottsdale, Arizona area and
licensed throughout the U.S., as well as ET CO and ET WY's other existing
business operations in Colorado, Arizona and Nevada outside of the Restricted
Areas ("Other Operations"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Thomas Title
shall not be subject to the non-Competition provisions of this Agreement and
shall be permitted to continue to close transactions in the ordinary course of
business; provided, however, during the Restrictive Period both Thomas Title
and the Other Operations shall be subject to a three year non-hiring
restrictive covenant with respect to the Transferred Employees. During the
Restricted Period, in the event that a Transferred Employee approaches ET CO,
ET WY, Thomas Title or any of the Other Operations regarding employment, ET
CO, ET WY, Thomas Title or the Other Operation will first obtain Buyer's
approval before discussing employment opportunities with the Transferred
Employee, but in no event will ET CO, ET WY, or the Other Operations contact
any Transferred Employee regarding employment opportunities. In addition, for
the Restricted Period, the Other Operations will not open physical (brick and
mortar) offices in the Restricted Areas, however, so long as it remains
primarily a commercial based title business and operates consistent with past
practices, Thomas Title is not restricted from opening offices in the
Restricted Areas. The Parties acknowledge that, in connection with the
transfer of company names the Seller may, for business purposes, reconstitute
Thomas Title and/or the Other Operations into new corporate entities
("Reconstitution"). Notwithstanding the Reconstitution of Thomas Title or one
more of the Other Operations, the terms of this Section 5.8 and Article VIII
will apply to the any newly form entity arising from a Reconstitution. 17 | P

to the extent that Selling Companies may provide the Buyer with such benefits
without violating the terms of such Unassigned Contract or applicable Law;
provided that the performance by the Buyer of an Unassigned Contract does not
cause a breach or threatened breach under such Unassigned Contract, the Buyer
agrees to perform, at its sole expense, all of the obligations of Selling
Companies to be performed after the Closing Date under each such Unassigned
Contract for which the Buyer receives benefits under after the Closing Date,
and to reimburse Selling Companies for any reasonable and required expenses
are incurred by Selling Companies on the Buyer's behalf in keeping such

provided, however, if the Colorado Title Group Division assets are transferred

agreement whereby Buyer shall continue to provide title search and exam
services to some or all of the Remaining Operations at service levels and

arising out of or related to (a) any breach of any representation or warranty
of Selling Companies contained in this Agreement; (b) the Retained Liabilities
or (c) fraud or gross and willful misrepresentation of the Selling Companies

shall apply to any Third-Party Claim: (a) The Indemnified Party will give the
Indemnifying Party written notice of any Third Party Claim within thirty (30)
days of becoming aware of any such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
a delay in giving such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party only to the
extent the Indemnifying Party suffers irreparable prejudice from or as a
result of such a delay. The Indemnifying Party will undertake the defense
thereof by representatives chosen by it, unless the Indemnifying Party
disputes the propriety of such Third Party Claim for indemnification against
it under the provisions of this Article VIII and delivers a written notice
("Dispute Notice") of such dispute and election not to indemnify within twenty
(20) days of receipt of written notice of such Third Party Claim (in which
case, the provisions of Section 9.14 shall govern the resolution of such

an adjudication of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall make
fully available to the Indemnifying Party and its representatives on a timely
basis all records and other materials required or requested by them and in the
possession or under the control of the Indemnified Party, for the use of the
Indemnifying Party and its representatives in defending any such Third Party
Claim, and shall in all other respects give full and prompt cooperation and
assistance in such defense. (b) If the Indemnifying Party timely delivers a
Dispute Notice to the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall
undertake the defense of the Third-Party Claim, subject to its rights against
the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII. In such event, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to control the defense of the Third-Party Claim,
including the right to settle or compromise any such Third-Party Claim without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, so long as such settlement includes a
full release of the Indemnifying Party and admits no Liability of the
Indemnifying Party. (c) Notwithstanding a Party's responsibility for the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the other Party shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense and with its own counsel, in the defense of a
Third Party Claim, and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
the Party having responsibility for defense of the Third Party Claim
("Defending Party") shall consult with the other party from time to time on
all material matters relating to the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Defending Party shall promptly provide the other Party with copies of all
pleadings and material correspondence relating to such Third-Party Claim. (d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not (i) be
entitled to control the defense of a Third-Party Claim if (A) the Third-Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (C) an actual
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party or (D) the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to be fully
responsible (with no reservation of rights) for all Losses relating to the
Third-Party Claim, and (ii) be entitled to settle any Third-Party Claim if
such settlement imposes any restriction or Liability on the Indemnified Party
other than the payment of money, for which the Indemnifying Party will be
responsible and will pay in full on the date of settlement, and for which the
Indemnified Party shall have no Liability. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 8.3, to the extent that any Third-Party Claim subject
to indemnity hereunder is ultimately determined to be the joint liability of
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party's
recovery hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim shall be limited to
the Indemnifying Party's proportional liability of such Third Party Claim. 8.4
Direct Claims Procedure. The following exclusive procedure shall govern any
and all indemnification claims against an Indemnifying Party which may be
brought pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement: (a) The Indemnified
Party shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of all claims, other
than Third Party Claims (the procedure for which is set forth in Section 8.3),
that could constitute a claim for indemnification under this Article VIII
within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such claim; provided, however,
that a delay in giving such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party only
to the extent the Indemnifying Party suffers irreparable prejudice from or as
a result of such a delay. The written notice shall specify, to the extent
known by the Indemnified Party, (i) the factual basis for such claim and, if
applicable, the specific alleged violation of this Agreement; (ii) the dollar

Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) days to make such 21 | P a g e

DocuSign Envelope ID: 70C8F090-AD7D-4389-882C-37454BD442AE investigation of
the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the
purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall fully and timely
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agrees
(subject to the Indemnifying Party executing a reasonable confidentiality
agreement) to make fully and timely available to the Indemnifying Party and/or
its authorized representatives the information relied upon by the Indemnified
Party to substantiate the claim, as well as any other information bearing
thereon reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of such
twenty (20) day investigation period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof) ("Investigation Period") to the validity and amount of such claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Indemnified Party the full amount of the claim, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.5. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party do
not mutually agree on the validity and amount of such claim at or prior to the
expiration of such Investigation Period, then the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall agree to resolve such dispute pursuant to Section 8.4
and Section 9.14. 8.5 Time Limitations on Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement: (a) No claim or action shall be brought under

period immediately following the Closing Date (the "Claim Period"); provided,
however, the Claim Period shall not apply for any claims resulting from the
fraud or gross and willful misrepresentation of the other Party. (b) The
representations and warranties in this Agreement, the Schedules, the Exhibits
and any certificate delivered by any party to another party in connection with
this Agreement shall (i) survive for the periods set forth in Section 8.5(a)
and (ii) in no event be affected or deemed waived by reason of any knowledge
or any investigation, inquiry or examination made for or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives), by reason of (A)
the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate, or (B) the Indemnified Party's acceptance of any certificate or
opinion hereunder, or (C) the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set
forth herein. The Buyer and Selling Companies acknowledge that indemnification
hereunder with respect to the breach of any covenant or agreement contained
herein, including any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement,
shall not be subject to any time or other limitations (other than those
imposed under any applicable statute of limitations). (c) Solely for the
purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising out of any breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (and not whether any
such representation or warranty has, in fact, been breached), such
representation or warranty shall be read as if all qualifications as to
materiality were deleted therefrom. (d) Except for Losses resulting from fraud
in which event there shall be no cap, an Indemnified Parties' right to recover
hereunder shall not exceed $10,000,000.00 in the aggregate ("Indemnification
Limit"). (e) Except for Losses resulting from fraud in which event there shall
be no basket, the Selling Companies, ET CO and ET WY shall not have any
obligation to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party unless and until Buyer
Indemnified Parties have suffered Buyer Indemnified Losses, in the aggregate,
in excess of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) (the "Basket"),
at which point the Selling Companies, ET CO or ET WY, as applicable, shall
indemnify such Buyer Indemnified Parties for amounts in excess of the Basket,
subject to the other limitations set forth herein. 22 | P a g e

DocuSign Envelope ID: 70C8F090-AD7D-4389-882C-37454BD442AE 8.6 Net Liability;
Recovery from Third Parties. In computing the amount of any Indemnified Loss,
such Indemnified Loss shall be deemed to be net of any insurance proceeds,
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment paid by a third party and
actually received with respect thereto; provided, however, that in all cases
the timing of the receipt or realization of insurance proceeds, and the net
present value of the incremental premium costs which are incurred by the
Indemnifying Party and substantiated by the applicable insurance carrier in
writing as having been so incurred as a result of such claim, shall each be
taken into account in determining the amount of any reduction of the
Indemnified Loss. 8.7 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any payment made by a
Selling Company as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII will
constitute a dollar-for-dollar decrease of the Purchase Price. For greater
certainty, any such decrease of the Purchase Price will be allocated among the
Purchased Assets to which such payment can reasonably be considered to relate
or if such payment does not reasonably relate to a particular asset(s), such
decrease will be allocated to goodwill. 8.8 Exclusive Remedy. The remedies set
forth in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties
following the Closing for any Losses arising out of any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties contained

Party's right to any remedy based on fraud or intentional misconduct or any
