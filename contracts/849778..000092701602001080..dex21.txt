Agreement Exhibit B Transaction Option Agreement Disclosure Schedules
(Intentionally Omitted)   4    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and 
--------- entered into as of February 19, 2002, among Cytyc Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Cruiser, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly  -------- owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Digene
Corporation, a Delaware  ---------- corporation ("Company").  ---------  
WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have unanimously approved the acquisition of the Company by
Parent, by means of the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement;  
WHEREAS, to effectuate the acquisition, Parent and the Company each desire
that Merger Sub commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), within
ten  ------------ (10) days of execution of this Agreement, a cash and stock
tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, ------ par value $0.01 per share of the Company (the
"Shares" or "Company Common  ------ -------------- Stock") at a price per
Share (such price being referred to herein as the "Offer  ----- Price") of
(i) $4.00 in cash (the "Cash Portion of the Offer Price"), and (ii) -----
------------------------------- 1.1969 shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent  ------ Common Stock") (the "Stock
Portion of the Offer Price"), upon the terms and ------------
-------------------------------- subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Offer Documents (as defined in Section 1.2), and the Board
of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved such Offer and agreed to
recommend to its stockholders that they accept the Offer and tender their
Shares pursuant thereto;   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that (a) the exchange of Shares for cash and Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger shall be treated as an integrated
transaction and such transactions together shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the  ---- rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, (b) this Agreement constitutes a plan of
reorganization, and (c) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will each be a
party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition of and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub
entering into this Agreement (i) certain beneficial and record holders of the
Company Common Stock are entering into an agreement, dated as of the date
hereof, in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Stockholders\' Agreement")
providing for the tender of the --------- ----------------------- Shares
held by such stockholders pursuant to the Offer (as defined in Section 1.1)
and certain other matters with respect to their Shares and (ii) the
Company has approved the execution and delivery of the Stockholders\'
Agreement by the parties thereto;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a further condition of and
inducement to Parent and Merger Sub entering into this Agreement (i) Parent
and the Company are entering into an agreement, dated as of the date hereof,
in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Transaction  ---------
----------- Option Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company is granting
Parent an option ---------------- to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock, solely to the extent   5   and for the purposes set forth in the
Transaction Option Agreement and (ii) the Company has approved the execution
and delivery of the Transaction Option Agreement by the parties thereto;
and   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Offer and the Merger (as defined in Section 2.1) and also to
prescribe various conditions to consummation thereof.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Stockholders\' Agreement and
the Transaction Option Agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE OFFER  SECTION 1.1 The
Offer.  ---------   (a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and the other terms of this
Agreement and (ii) none of the events set forth in Annex A attached hereto
shall have occurred and are continuing, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and
the Company, within ten (10) days after the date hereof, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to commence the Offer. Each Share accepted by Merger Sub pursuant
to the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive from Merger Sub the
Merger Consideration (defined in Section 2.6(a) below). The initial
expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth business day following
commencement of the Offer. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that
there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer
prior to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn at least a number
of shares of Company Common Stock that represents a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (the "Minimum
Condition"), and to the other conditions set forth in Annex 
----------------- A hereto. As used herein, "Fully Diluted Basis" shall mean
after taking into account all currently outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and assuming the exercise or conversion of all options, warrants,
convertible securities and similar rights and the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock that the Company is obligated to issue thereunder other
than pursuant to the Transaction Option Agreement.   (b) Parent and Merger
Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer
and to amend or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (and Parent shall not
cause Merger Sub to) (i) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer,
(ii) change the form of consideration to be paid, (iii) waive or increase the
Minimum Condition or impose material conditions to the Offer in addition to
those set forth in Annex A, (iv) extend the Offer (except as set forth herein
or in the Offer), or (v) make any other change to any of the terms and
conditions to the Offer which is materially adverse to the holders of Shares.
Subject only to the terms of the Offer and this   6   Agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted by this Agreement) of the
conditions to the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer and shall pay
for all such Shares promptly after acceptance; provided that, unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, (x) Merger Sub may in
its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company and shall, at the
request of the Company, extend the Offer for successive extension periods not
in excess of 10 business days each if, at the scheduled expiration date of
the Offer or any extension thereof, any of the conditions to the Offer shall
not have been satisfied or waived, until such times as such conditions are
satisfied or waived, and (y) Merger Sub may extend the Offer for any period
if and to the extent required by the applicable rules and regulations of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In addition, Merger
Sub may extend the Offer after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a
further period of time beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise
be permitted under this Section by means of a subsequent offering period
under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, of not more than 20
business days to meet the objective (which is not a condition to the Offer)
that there be validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the Offer,
prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as so extended) and not withdrawn
a number of Shares, which together with Shares then owned by Parent and
Merger Sub, represents at least 90% of the Shares outstanding on a Fully
Diluted Basis.  SECTION 1.2 Offer Documents. As soon as practicable on the
date of  --------------- commencement of the Offer, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer
and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Registration
Statement"). The  ---------------------- Registration Statement will include
a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule
14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "Preliminary Prospectus").
As soon as practicable on the date of commencement 
---------------------- of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file or
cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
promulgated under Section 14(d)(1) of the Exchange Act (the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer which shall  ----------- contain the offer to
purchase and related letter of transmittal and other ancillary Offer
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer 
----- Documents"), which Offer Documents shall contain (or shall be amended
in a --------- timely manner to contain) all information which is required
to be included therein in accordance with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and any other applicable law, and shall conform in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and any other
applicable law, including that the Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that  -------- ------- no agreement or
representation hereby is made or shall be made by Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to information supplied by the Company expressly for inclusion in, or
with respect to Company information derived from the Company\'s public
filings with the SEC that is included or incorporated by reference in, the
Offer Documents, (ii) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO to the Company at its
principal executive office, (iii) give telephonic notice and mail to
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") a copy of
the  ---- Schedule TO in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, and (iv) mail or otherwise cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Company shall  
7   provide Parent and Merger Sub all information reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by
them for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and Merger Sub further
agrees to take all lawful action necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed promptly with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders
of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable law. In conducting the Offer, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act
and any other applicable law. The Company and its counsel shall be given the
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub agree
to provide the Company and its counsel any comments Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments.  SECTION 1.3 Company Actions. 
---------------   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer and represents that (1) its Board of Directors (at a meeting duly
called and held) unanimously (i) determined that each of this Agreement, the
Transaction Option Agreement, the Stockholders\' Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, are advisable and are fair to and in the best interests of the
stockholders of the Company, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the Transaction Option Agreement, and the
Stockholders\' Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger and the
acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, and such approval
constitutes approval of the foregoing for purposes of Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended, the "DGCL") such that the
Offer, the Merger, this  ---- Agreement, the Transaction Option Agreement
and the Stockholders\' Agreement are not and shall not be subject to any
restriction pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL, and (iii) resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger by the holders of Company Common Stock (the recommendations
referred to in this clause (iii) are collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the "Recommendations"), and (2) Goldman Sachs and Co. has 
--------------- delivered to the Board of Directors of the Company its
written opinion that, as of the date hereof, the consideration to be received
by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Offer pursuant to this
Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Recommendations, subject to the withdrawal or modification thereof as
provided in Section 6.3(b). The Company has been advised that all of its
directors and executive officers presently intend to tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer.   (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC
simultaneously with the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule TO,
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing
such  -------------- Recommendations of the Board of Directors of the
Company in favor of the Offer and the Merger and otherwise complying with
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and any other applicable law and
shall contain (or shall be amended in a timely manner to contain) all  
8   information which is required to be included therein in accordance with
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and any other
applicable law and shall be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company
and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree
promptly to correct any information provided by them for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect and the Company further agrees to take all lawful action
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed promptly
with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable law. Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC. Company agrees to provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
counsel any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC with
respect to the 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments.   (c) In
connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish, or cause its
transfer agent to furnish, Parent with mailing labels, security position
listings and all available listings or computer files containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of the Company Common Stock as of
the latest practicable date and shall furnish, or cause its transfer agent
to furnish, Parent with such information and assistance (including updated
lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as
Parent or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, and except for such actions as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and each of their
affiliates, associates, partners, employees, agents and advisors shall hold
in confidence the information contained in such labels and lists, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if
this Agreement is terminated, in accordance with its terms, shall deliver
promptly to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession or under their control.  SECTION 1.4 Directors.  ---------  
(a) Promptly following the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub pursuant
to the Offer of such number of shares of Company Common Stock which
represents at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (on a Fully Diluted Basis), and from time to time thereafter (the
"Appointment Time"),  ---------------- Parent shall be entitled to designate
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number as will give
Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act,
representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to the product
of (x) the number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company
(giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this
Section 1.4) and (y) the percentage that such number of Shares so purchased
bears to the aggregate number of Shares then outstanding (such number being,
the "Board Percentage"), and the Company shall promptly 
---------------- satisfy the Board Percentage by (i) increasing the size of
the Board of Directors of the Company or (ii) using its best efforts to
secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary  
9   to enable Parent\'s designees to be elected to the Board of Directors
of the Company and shall cause Parent\'s designees promptly to be so elected.
At the request of Parent, the Company shall take, at the Company\'s expense,
all lawful action necessary to effect any such election, including, without
limitation, mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, unless such
information has previously been provided to the Company\'s stockholders in
the Schedule 14D-9. Parent will supply the Company and be solely responsible
for any information with respect to Parent, its designees and its nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section 14A and Rule
14-f-1   (b) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees
pursuant to this Section 1.4 and prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 2.2) of the Merger, any (i) amendment or termination of this
Agreement, (ii) extension for the performance or waiver of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, or (iii) waiver of the Company\'s rights
hereunder shall require the concurrence of a majority of directors of the
Company then in office who are "Continuing Directors". The term "Continuing
Director" shall mean (i) each  ------------------- member of the Board of
Directors of the Company on the date hereof and (ii) any successor to any
Continuing Director that was recommended to succeed such Continuing Director
by a majority of the Continuing Directors then on the Board of Directors.

are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or  
10   or waiver of these conditions, or at such other time, date and
location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). 
-------------  SECTION 2.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the  -------------------- Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation

duties of Company and Merger Sub.  SECTION 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation;
Bylaws.  ------------------------------------   (a) At the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by

---------------------------------- Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to
be canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.10), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted
(subject to Section 2.6(e)) into the right to receive an amount in cash and
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Offer Price (together with
the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section
2.7(e)), without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.7 (the "Merger Consideration"). All such shares 
-------------------- of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration   11   therefor upon the surrender
of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.7 hereof, without
interest.   (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Each
share of  ---------------------------------------------------- Company
Common Stock held by Company or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.   (c) Options; Roche Conversion. At the Effective Time,
all options to  ------------------------- purchase Company Common Stock then
outstanding (each a "Company Option"), whether (i) under the Company\'s
Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Plan, Digene Omnibus Plan, 1997 Stock
Option Plan, Directors\' Stock Option Plan (the "Company  ------- Stock
Option Plans") or option agreements, or (ii) otherwise, shall be
treated ------------------ in accordance with Section 2.9 of this Agreement.
The Company has no outstanding warrants. At the Effective Time, the
conversion of the Roche Diagnostic up front payment in the amount of
$5,000,000 (the "Roche Conversion")  ---------------- shall be treated in
accordance with Section 2.10 of this Agreement.   (d) Capital Stock of
Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value 
--------------------------- $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub
Common Stock"), issued and  ----------------------- outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
(e) Adjustments to Number of Shares of Parent Common Stock. If, 
------------------------------------------------------ during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur,
including, without limitation, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock paid in the
Offer and the Merger and other items dependent thereon shall be appropriately
adjusted.  SECTION 2.7 Exchange of Certificates. 
------------------------   (a) Exchange Agent. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall  -------------- select an institution reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent make the payments of the
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(a) hereof in the
Merger (the "Exchange Agent").  --------------   (b) Exchange Fund. As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall make  ------------- available to the
Exchange Agent for payment in accordance with this Article the cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to 
------------- Section 2.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock. All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be invested by
the Exchange Agent, as Parent directs, in (i) direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to   12   provide for
the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc., or Standard
and Poor\'s Ratings Services, or (iv) money market funds investing solely in
a combination of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or interest
or income produced by, such investments will be payable to Merger Sub or
Parent, as Parent directs.   (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the  ------------------- Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates ("Certificates") which immediately  ------------ prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent for
exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the
holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only
the right to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.7(d). No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends
or distributions payable to holders of Certificates. If payment is to be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be promptly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable.   (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or  ------------------------------------------------ other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such holder
surrenders such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.7 (at which
time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable
escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions,
without interest). Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holders of certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger
Consideration, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable
with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with   13   respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (e) Fractional Shares. No
certificate or scrip representing fractional  ----------------- Parent
Common Stock will be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional Parent Common Stock will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common
Stock. In lieu of any such fractional share of Parent Common Stock, each
holder of Certificates who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock in exchange for such Certificate (after
taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) pursuant to
this Section 2.7(e) shall receive from the Exchange Agent, as applicable, a
cash payment rounded up to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying
(A) the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by (B) the average of the last sales prices of one share of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market during the ten
consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day
immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.   (f) Withholding
Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the 
------------------ Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable or deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent.   (g) Lost,
Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any 
-------------------------------------- Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.7(d); provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of such Merger Consideration and other dividends
or distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (h) No Liability. Neither the Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall  ------------ be liable to any holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   14    (i) Termination of Exchange Fund;
Interest. Any portion of the Exchange 
-------------------------------------- Fund (including any interest received
with respect thereto) which remains undistributed to the holders of Company
Common Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II and the instructions set forth in
the letter of transmittal mailed to such holder after the Effective Time
shall thereafter look only to the Parent for Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d). Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock five (5) years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any government entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.  SECTION 2.8 Stock Transfer
Books. Subject to Section 2.9, at the Effective  -------------------- Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after the Effective
Time, any certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any
reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration.  SECTION 2.9 Stock
Options.  -------------   (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Option will be assumed by Parent, and shall be exercisable in
accordance with the terms of such Company Option for (i) a number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by a number equal to the Stock Portion of the Offer
Price and (together with the number of shares determined in accordance with
clause (i)) (ii) an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest cent) equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by a number equal to the Cash Portion of the Offer
Price. The exercise price per share applicable to each Company Option and
immediately after the Effective Time will be equal to a number (rounded up to
the nearest cent) equal to the quotient of the exercise price per share
of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by a
number equal to the Stock Portion of the Purchase Price.   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the
participants in the Company Stock Option Plans appropriate notice setting
forth such participants\' rights pursuant thereto and the outstanding Company
Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 2.9 and required by the Company
Stock Option Plans after giving effect to the Merger). Consistent with the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the documents governing the
outstanding options under those plans, the Merger shall not result in the
termination of any outstanding Company Options under the Company Stock Option
Plans that are so assumed by Parent or the shares of Parent Common Stock that
will be subject to those options upon Parent\'s assumption of   15   the
Company Options in the Merger. All holders of Company Options shall have
the right to exercise such options following the Effective Time, with full
credit given to all of the provisions of the existing stock option agreements
and the Company Stock Option Plans, including provisions regarding vesting
and service relating to any predecessor corporation acquired by the Company.
It is the intention of the parties that the options so assumed by Parent
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as incentive
stock options prior to the Effective Time. Within 15 business days after the
Effective Time, provided that the Parent has received within 10 business days
after the Effective Time all option documentation it requires relating to the
outstanding Company Options, Parent will issue to each person who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is a holder of an outstanding
Company Option under the Company Stock Option Plans that is to be assumed by
Parent hereunder, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such
option by Parent.   (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery under the Company Stock Option Plans assumed in accordance with this
Section. As soon as practicable and in no event more than fifteen (15)
business days after the Effective Time, provided that the Parent has received
within 10 business days after the Effective Time all option documentation it
requires relating to the outstanding Company Options, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor forms), with respect to
such options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Company Options under the Company Stock Option
Plans remain outstanding. The Company shall cooperate with and assist Parent
in the preparation of such registration statements.   (d) The Board of
Directors of the Company shall, prior to or as of the Effective Time, take
all necessary actions, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
Company Stock Option Plans and the instruments evidencing the Company
Options, to provide for the conversion of the Company Options into options to
acquire Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section, and that no
consent of the holders of the Company Options is required in connection
with such conversion.   (e) The Board of Directors of the Company shall,
prior to or as of the Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve the
deemed cancellation of the Company Options for purposes of Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act. The Board of Directors of Parent shall, prior to or as of
the Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve the deemed grant of
options to purchase Parent Common Stock under the Company Options (as
converted pursuant to this Section) for purposes of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act.  SECTION 2.10 Roche Conversion. At the Effective Time, the
obligation of the  ---------------- Company under its letter agreement dated
April 29, 2001, as amended to date, with Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. to
convert the $5,000,000 up front payment by Roche Diagnostics into Company
Common Stock (if not previously converted) will be assumed by Parent and such
payment, when converted, shall be converted into (a) the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
equal to the product of the number of shares of   16   Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by a number equal to the Stock Portion of the Offer
Price and (together with the number of shares determined in accordance with
clause (a)), and (b) an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest
cent) equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by a number equal to the Cash Portion of the Offer Price. The
conversion price per share immediately after the Effective Time will be equal
to a number (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the quotient of the
conversion price per share immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
a number equal to the Stock Portion of the Purchase Price.  SECTION 2.11
Dissenting Shares. Shares of Company Common Stock that are 
----------------- outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares")  ----------------- shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them
in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting
Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective
Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.7, of the
Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock. Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands. Any amounts paid to a holder pursuant
to a right of appraisal will be paid by Company. The existence of Dissenting
Shares, so long as the conditions in Annex A are met (and the Agreement is
not otherwise terminated), shall have no effect on the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub under the Offer and the Merger.  SECTION 2.12 No Further
Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger 
--------------------------------------------------- Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7(d) and (e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the
Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.  SECTION 2.13 Taking All Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any
time after  ------------------------------------------- the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors  
17   of Company, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will take all
such lawful and necessary action in the name of the Surviving Corporation,
Company or Merger Sub, as appropriate.    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS

court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority
or instrumentality, foreign, domestic or supranational ("Governmental
Entity") or  ------------------- other person, is required to be obtained or

agreements as to which the Company is a party and pursuant to which
the Company is authorized to use (1) any third party patents, trademarks,
trade secrets or copyrights (including software) (the "Company Third Party 
------------------- Intellectual Property Rights") which are incorporated in,
are, or form a part ---------------------------- of, or were utilized in the
development of, any Company product or proposed product, or (2) any trade
secret of a third party in or as to any Company product or proposed product,

or limit, impair or alter the Company\'s methods or manner of licensing or
distribution. The Company Third Party Intellectual Property Rights have been
duly and validly assigned to or licensed by the licensor of such right to
Company, and each such assignment or license is in full force and effect,
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms. Except as set forth in
Section 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the sale, license,
lease, transfer, use, distribution, modification or other exploitation by the
Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns of any product included in or incorporating any of the Company
Intellectual Property obligates or will obligate the Company, any subsidiary
of the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns to pay any
royalty, fee or other compensation to any other person.   (c) The Company

Intellectual Property Rights or the Company Third Party Intellectual Property
Rights (to the extent arising out of any use, reproduction or distribution of
such Company Third Party Intellectual Rights by or through the Company), have
been asserted or are threatened by any person. The Company does not know of
any valid grounds for any bona fide claims (i) to the effect that the
manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any product as now used, sold
or licensed or proposed for use, sale or license by the Company infringes on
any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark or trade secret; (ii) against
the use by the Company of any trademarks, trade names, trade secrets,

challenging the Company\'s license or legally enforceable right to use, or
the validity, enforceability or effectiveness of, the Company Third Party
Intellectual Property Rights.   (d) To the knowledge of the Company, all
registered trademarks, service marks, and copyrights held by the Company are
valid and subsisting. All patents held by the Company are valid, enforceable,
and subsisting, and all patent applications held by Company are pending in
their respective patent office, and the Company is unaware of any facts that
would form the basis   28   for a refusal of, or of any defects in the
prosecution of any such application that would irrevocably foreclose, the
grant of patent rights under such application. To the knowledge of the
Company, except as set forth on Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there has been and is no unauthorized use, disclosure, infringement
or misappropriation of any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights or any
Company Third Party Intellectual Property Right to the extent licensed by or
through the Company, by any third party, including any employee or former
employee of the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries (i)
has been sued or charged in writing as a defendant in any claim, suit, action
or proceeding which involves a claim of infringement of any patents,
trademarks, service marks, copyrights or violation of any trade secret or
other proprietary right of any third party; (ii) has been threatened
or charged in writing, orally or otherwise with infringement or violation of
any patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights or trade secrets or
other proprietary right of any third party; and (iii) has knowledge of valid
grounds for any such threat or claim.   (e) No Company Intellectual
Property Right or Company Third Party Intellectual Property Right is subject
to any outstanding order, judgment, decree, legal or governmental proceeding
(other than pending applications for patent, trademark registration or
copyright registration) or stipulation restricting in any manner the
licensing thereof by Company. Except for agreements listed on the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not entered into any agreement to
indemnify any other person against any charge of infringement of any Company
Third Party Intellectual Property Right.   (f) The Company has taken
reasonable measures consistent with industry practice to protect and preserve
(i) the validity and enforceability of trademarks included in the Company
Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) the confidentiality, validity and
enforceability of copyrights and pending patent applications included in the
Company Intellectual Property Rights, (iii) the validity and enforceability
of patents included in the Company Intellectual Property Rights, and (iv) the
confidentiality, validity and enforceability of its trade secrets and other
confidential information. All employees, contractors, agents and consultants
of the Company have executed a nondisclosure and assignment of inventions
agreement to protect the confidentiality and to vest in the Company exclusive
ownership of such intellectual property rights substantially in the form
attached to Section 3.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and to the
Company\'s knowledge, no such person has violated such agreement. Moreover,
the individuals listed on Section 3.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
have entered into noncompetition and consulting agreements in the form
attached to such disclosure as appropriate. To the knowledge of the Company,
no material trade secret or confidential information of the Company has been
used, divulged, appropriated or misappropriated for the benefit of any person
other than the Company or otherwise to the detriment of the Company. To the
knowledge of the Company, no employee, contractor, agent or consultant of the
Company has used any trade secrets or other confidential information of
any other person in the course of their work for the Company. The Company has
no written or oral agreements with employees, contractors, agents or
consultants with respect to the ownership of inventions, trade secrets or
other works created by them as a result of which any such employee,
contractor, agent or consultant may have nonexclusive rights to any portion
of the Company Intellectual Property Rights so created by such
individual.   29    (g) To the Company\'s knowledge, no officer,
employee, contractor, agent or consultant of the Company is, or is now
expected to be, in violation of any term of any employment contract, patent
disclosure agreement, proprietary information agreement, noncompetition
agreement, nonsolicitation agreement, confidentiality agreement, or any other
similar contract or agreement or any restrictive covenant relating to the
right of any such officer, employee, contractor, agent or consultant to be
employed or engaged by the Company because of the nature of the business
conducted or to be conducted by the Company or relating to the use of trade
secrets or proprietary information of others, and to the Company\'s knowledge
belief the continued employment or retention of its officers, employees,
contractors, agents or consultants does not subject the Company to any
liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters.  SECTION 3.10

any acquisition of material property by Company or any of its
subsidiaries.   (b) The Company and its subsidiaries hold all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental

(collectively, the "Company  ------- Permits"), and are in compliance with

---------------   (a) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall,
nor shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries authorize or permit any of
its or their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate
or encourage any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiries or

party that, subject to the Company\'s compliance with Section 6.3(a), has
made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with the
Company\'s financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish
to such third party nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, (iii) take and disclose to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or otherwise
make disclosure to them, (iv) following receipt of such an
Acquisition Proposal, withdraw, modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail

the Company by any court of competent jurisdiction if, in each case (1)
neither the Company nor any representative of Company and its subsidiaries
shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3,
(2) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
obligations to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law, (3) prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into any such
discussions with, such person or group, the Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the Company\'s intention
to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such
person or group, and the Company receives from such person or group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
with regard to the Company\'s confidential information as the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in Section 6.6), (4) gives Parent prompt advance notice
of its intent to furnish such nonpublic information or enter into such
discussions (which notice shall in no event be given less than one
(1) business day prior to furnishing such information or entering into
such discussions), and (5) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such person or group, the Company furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent). The Company and
its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause any such parties in possession of confidential information about the
Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or
destroy all such information in the possession of any such party or in the

foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding two sentences by any officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or representative of the   50   Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the
Company.   (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with

Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent informed
promptly of any amendments of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.  
For purpose of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, 
----------------- unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on terms that the
Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after consultation with its financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than
as provided hereunder, is reasonably capable of being consummated and for
which financing, to the extent required, is then committed; provided,
however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal"
if any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such
offer is not likely in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
having received the advice of a financing advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.   For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer 
-------------------- or proposal by a third party, other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any affiliate thereof, relating to: (A) any acquisition or purchase
from the Company by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of

interest in the outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning
15% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 85% of
the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (B) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license,
acquisition, or disposition of more than 15% of the consolidated assets of
the Company; (C) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (D) any
other transaction the consummation of which would or could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.  SECTION 6.4

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.  SECTION 6.5 Voting of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub agree to
vote all Shares  ---------------- acquired in the Offer or otherwise

the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless (including
advancement of expenses) the current and former directors and officers of the
Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time to the extent provided in the Company Charter Documents
in effect on the date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law.
Parent will cause to be maintained for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time the Company\'s current directors\' and
officers\' insurance and indemnification policy to the extent that it
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO;
Insurance") for all persons who  ------------- are directors and officers of
the Company on the date of this Agreement, or shall purchase a "tail" on the
Company\'s existing policy to cover such period. If the existing DandO;
Insurance cannot be maintained, expires or is terminated or canceled during
such three-year period, Parent will use reasonable efforts to cause to be
obtained as much DandO; Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period on terms and conditions substantially similar to the existing
DandO; Insurance. It is understood that, unless made by a court, any
determination as to whether a person seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.9 has met any applicable legal standard for indemnification shall
be made by a committee consisting of at least two of Parent\'s independent
directors.   (b) In the event Parent of the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this
Section 6.9, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set

by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for all of their respective obligations under this

Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be reserved for issuance,
in connection with the Offer and the Merger, effective upon official notice
of issuance.  SECTION 6.11 Letters of Accountants. Company and Parent shall
use their  ---------------------- respective reasonable efforts to cause to
be delivered to Parent letters of Company\'s and Parent\'s independent
accountants, respectively, dated no more than two business days before the
date on which the Registration Statement becomes effective (and satisfactory
in form and substance to Parent), that is customary in scope and substance
for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.  
54   SECTION 6.12 Takeover Statutes; Rights Plan. If any takeover statute
or  ------------------------------ "poison pill" shareholder rights plan is
or may become applicable to the Offer or Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction Option Agreement or the
Stockholders\' Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions
as are necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, the
Transaction Option Agreement and the Stockholders\' Agreement and otherwise
act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute and any regulations
promulgated thereunder on such transactions or to make such rights plan
inapplicable to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction Option Agreement
and the Stockholders\' Agreement. The Company agrees that on and after the
date hereof, it will not adopt any "poison pill" rights plan or any similar
antitakeover plan or take any other action that would impede or prevent
completion of the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement, the Transaction Option
Agreement or the Stockholders\' Agreement.  SECTION 6.13 Certain Employee
Benefits.  -------------------------   (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall make available or cause to be made available to each individual who was
an employee of the Company immediately before the Effective Time and who is
an employee of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time
(a "Transferred Employee") health, prescription drug, long-term disability,
short-term disability, life insurance, dental and other welfare benefits that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to such benefits in effect at the
Effective Time for similarly situated employees of Parent. Such benefits may
be provided by Parent, at its option, through the employee plans maintained
by Parent (or one or more of its ERISA Affiliates) or through Company
Employee Plans providing such benefits. Thereafter, with respect to such
benefits, Parent and its ERISA Affiliates shall not discriminate against
Transferred Employees in relation to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its ERISA Affiliates by reason of their status as Transferred
Employees.   (b) To the extent that Parent wishes to provide the benefits
described in Section 6.13(a) to Transferred Employees through a Parent
employee plan providing such benefits (a "Replacement Plan"), Parent shall
take appropriate action to waive any waiting period, pre-existing condition
or requirement for evidence of insurability otherwise imposed under any such
Parent employee plan with respect to any Transferred Employee who was covered
by a Company Employee Plan providing similar benefits prior to the Effective
Time. To the extent that the benefits described in Section 6.13(a) for
Transferred Employees are provided pursuant to a Replacement Plan at any time
other than during a general open enrollment applicable to all employees of
Parent and Surviving Corporation, Parent (i) shall take appropriate action to
waive any actively at work requirements, and (ii) shall give credit under
such Replacement Plan to all Transferred Employees and their covered
dependents for all deductibles and out- of-pocket expense limitations
incurred by the Transferred Employees and their covered dependents under the
Company Employee Plans. Parent\'s obligations under this paragraph are
conditioned upon the approval of the insurance providers of applicable
benefit plans.   (c) Parent shall not reduce the accrued vacation and sick
or other paid leave of each Transferred Employee under the Company Employee
Plans as of the Effective Time. After the   55   Effective Time, Parent
shall provide severance benefits to all Transferred Employees with terms no
less favorable than the severance benefits currently offered by Parent to its
employees of similar status.   (d) Unless the parties otherwise agree in
writing, the Company shall take all action necessary to terminate, or cause
to terminate, before the Effective Time, any Company Employee Plan that is a
defined contribution / Section 401(k) savings plan (the "Company 401(k)
Plan").   (e) Parent shall take appropriate steps to permit participation
as soon as practicable in any defined contribution / 401(k) savings
plan, maintained by Parent immediately following the Effective Time by
Transferred Employees who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan. For purposes of
eligibility (including eligibility for early retirement) and vesting under
any such Parent employee pension benefit plan, Parent shall credit
Transferred Employees for their length of service with the Company, its ERISA
Affiliates, and any predecessor of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates as of
the Effective Time.   (f) After the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
severance benefits to employees of the Company with terms no less favorable
than the severance benefits currently offered by Parent to its employees of
similar status.   (g) No provision of this Section 6.13 shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights in any Transferred Employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with Parent, and no
provision of this Section 6.13 shall create any such rights in any such
individuals in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Company Employee Plan or any plan or arrangement that
may be established by Parent. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute
a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Effective Time
any such plans or arrangements of Parent. No provision of this Agreement
shall cause any Transferred Employee to be a third party beneficiary of any
rights herein.  SECTION 6.14 Employment, Consulting, Noncompetition, and
Other Agreements. The 
------------------------------------------------------------ Company agrees
to cooperate with Parent in its efforts to negotiate employment, consulting,
noncompetition or other agreements with any key employees or individuals
identified by Parent between the date hereof and the Effective
Time.  SECTION 6.15 Tax Matters. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees  ----------- that it will not take any action (including the failure
to merge the Surviving Corporation with and into Parent) which would
reasonably be expected to cause the exchange of Shares for cash and Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
Company, Merger Sub and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub
or Company shall be liable for any transfer taxes   56   imposed on the
transfer of the Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement (including,
but not limited to, stock transfer taxes, stamp taxes and any transfer or
recording fees (together with any related interest, penalties or additions to
tax)).  SECTION 6.16 Change of Control. Except as contemplated by Section
2.9 and in  ----------------- the Company Option Plans and Benefit Plans,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Transaction Option
Agreement and the Stockholders\' Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, except as set forth in
Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) result in any payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, tax gross-up, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due to any Employee, from the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under any Stock Plan, Benefit Plan, agreement or otherwise, (ii)
materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Stock Plan,
Benefit Plan, agreement or otherwise or (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment, exercise or vesting of any such benefits.  SECTION 6.17
Limitation on the Company\'s Investment Banking Fees\'. The Company 
---------------------------------------------------- covenants and agrees
that the investment banking and/or consulting fees incurred or to be incurred
by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Transaction Option Agreement and the Stockholders\' Agreement
shall be based upon (and not in excess of) the engagement letter between the
Company and Goldman, Sachs and Co. dated February 13, 2002.  SECTION 6.18
Registration Statement. Parent shall promptly prepare and file 
---------------------- with the SEC under the Securities Act the Registration
Statement and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable.
Parent shall promptly take any action required to be taken under foreign or
state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger. Company shall cause Ballard, Spahr, Andrews and Ingersoll, LLP,
or such other counsel chosen by Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent,
to provide a Tax opinion regarding the tax consequences to the Company and
its shareholders of the Offer and the Merger in the form required by the SEC
in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and Company shall provide reasonable and customary representations
to Ballard, Spahr, Andrews and Ingersoll, LLP (or such other counsel) in
connection with the rendering of such Tax opinion.  SECTION 6.19 Section 16
Matters. Prior to the expiration date of the Offer, 
------------------- Parent and the Company shall take all such reasonable
steps (including appropriate actions by their respective Board of Directors)
as may be required or advisable, to the extent permitted, under and in
accordance with applicable law, to cause any disposition of Shares or
acquisitions of Parent Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to Parent Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I
and Article II of this Agreement, by each individual or entity that is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Parent or the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.  SECTION 6.20 Election of Director to
Parent Board. Promptly following the 
------------------------------------ Effective Time, Parent shall have
elected Evan Jones (or a nominee of Mr. Jones, mutually agreeable to Mr.  
57   Jones and Parent) to its Board of Directors. Parent shall be obligated
to nominate Mr. Jones to serve on Parent\'s Board of Directors until the
third anniversary of the Effective Time.    ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO

only as of such date), or (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Merger Agreement that are not so qualified shall
not have been true and correct as of the date of determination or the date
hereof as if made at and as of such time (other than representations and

failures to be true and correct are reasonably   59   likely to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

of its obligations, agreements or covenants under this Agreement and such
breach or failure to perform or comply is likely to result, individually or

the Company concludes in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel that to satisfy its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable law, the Board of Directors must not make or must
withdraw or modify the Recommendations and the Board of Directors in fact

other parties hereto, except (i) as set forth in this Section 8.2, Section
8.3 and/or Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination of this

of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.  SECTION 8.3 Fees and
Expenses.  -----------------   (a) General. Except as set forth in this
Section 8.3, all fees and  ------- expenses incurred in connection with this

enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails to pay in a timely
manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party makes a claim that results in a judgment
or settlement for the fee set forth in this Section 8.3(b), the liable party

the purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition" shall mean any of 
------------------- the following transactions (other than the transactions

be waived by Parent and/or Merger Sub, in whole or in part, from time to time
in its or their sole discretion, except as otherwise provided in the
Agreement. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right and may be asserted at any time
and from time to time. Any reasonable determination by Parent and/or Merger
Sub concerning any of the events described herein shall be final and
binding.   69    '
