Stock. If any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent Stock issued in exchange for such shares will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Stock may accordingly be
marked with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled
to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

<PAGE>

shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the

with a duly executed and completed Transmittal Letter, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.6, less such holder's pro rata portion of Merger
Shares to be deposited with the Depositary Agent or with the Retention Escrow
Agent pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.6(c). Such certificate representing shares of Parent Stock
shall be delivered to the stockholder as promptly as practicable after such
surrender, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after such
surrender.

                  (c)      Cancellation of Common Stock and Preferred Stock.
Upon surrender of each Certificate and delivery by Parent of the Merger Shares
to be delivered in exchange therefor, such Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to
evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the aggregate number of
Merger Shares into which the Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented thereby
shall have been converted in accordance with the terms and upon the conditions
of this Agreement (including the requirement that a portion of such Merger
Shares be deposited with the Depositary Agent or with the Retention Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 2.10), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.6(c).

                  (d)      Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Stock declared or made after the Effective Time and with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, promptly following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, if any, theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Stock.

         2.8      No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock. The shares of Parent Stock delivered upon the surrender for
exchange of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Common Stock or Preferred Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, the Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article 2.

Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Stock as may
be required pursuant to Section 2.6; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an indemnity
or bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

multiplied by (ii) 0.10, and rounded to a whole number of shares on a
holder-by-holder basis (such shares of Parent Stock delivered to the Depositary
Agent, the "Indemnity Escrow Shares"). The portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Shares contributed on behalf of each Stockholder shall be in proportion to the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled under Section 2.6. The Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be withheld from
the Parent Stock otherwise deliverable to the Stockholders. The Indemnity Escrow
Shares shall be deposited with the Depositary Agent and disbursed in accordance
with the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

                  (b)      Retention Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding the other

shares of Parent Stock equal to (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Stock to which the Core Employees would otherwise be entitled pursuant to
Section 2.6 multiplied by (ii) 0.20, and rounded to a whole number of shares on
a holder-by-holder basis (such shares of Parent Stock delivered to the Retention
Escrow Agent, the "Retention Escrow Shares"). The portion of the Retention

                  (a)      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock held by a holder who
has demanded and perfected dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with
the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
or represent a right to receive Parent Stock pursuant to Section 2.6, but the
holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)
above, if any holder of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock who demands
dissenters' rights for such shares

                                       20
<PAGE>

under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to dissenters' rights, then, as of the later of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent
Stock as provided in Section 2.6, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares.

                  (c)      The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
its receipt of any written demands for dissenters' rights for any shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments relating to the Merger served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters' rights under the DGCL. The

settle or settle any such demands.

         2.12     Options/Restricted Stock Units.

                  (a)      Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company (the "Company Board") (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
and the Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board") (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other
actions necessary to provide that effective at the Effective Time, each Company
Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments in this Section 2.12)
and each such Company Option shall be converted automatically into an option (a
"New Option") to purchase the number of shares of Parent Stock, determined as
provided below, at the exercise price, determined as provided below:

                           (i)      The number of shares of Parent Stock to be
         subject to the New Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the
         number of shares of Common Stock remaining subject (as of immediately
         prior to the Effective Time) to the Company Option multiplied by (y)
         the Exchange Ratio, provided that the number of shares of Parent Stock
         resulting therefrom shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole
         share of Parent Stock.

                           (ii)     The exercise price per share of Parent Stock
under the New Option shall be equal to (x) the exercise price per share of the
Common Stock under the Company Option, divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole
cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the exercise price per
share be greater than the Closing Price, provided that any reduction in such
exercise price as a result of the application of this sentence shall be
disregarded for purposes of calculating "Equity Consideration."

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any Company Option which is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be, and
is intended to be, effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a)
of the Code. Except as provided in this Section 2.12, after the Effective Time,
each New Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and

                                       21
<PAGE>

conditions as were applicable to the related Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that with regard to such New Option, any references
to the Company shall be deemed, as appropriate, to mean Parent). Parent shall
take all action necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time, to authorize and
reserve a number of shares of Parent Stock sufficient for issuance upon the
exercise of New Options as contemplated by this Section 2.12.

                  (b)      Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) and the Parent Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other
actions necessary to provide that effective at the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Stock Unit, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent
and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments in this
Section 2.12) and each such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted
automatically into a restricted stock unit (a "New Restricted Stock Unit") for
that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock subject (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) to the Company
Restricted Stock Unit multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; provided, that the
number of shares of Parent Stock resulting therefrom shall be rounded downward
to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock. Except as provided in this Section
2.12, after the Effective Time, each New Restricted Stock Unit shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (except
that with regard to such New Restricted Stock Unit, any references to the
Company shall be deemed, as appropriate, to mean Parent). Parent shall take all
action necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time, to authorize and reserve a
number of shares of Parent Stock sufficient for issuance pursuant to the New
Restricted Stock Units as contemplated by this Section 2.12.

                  (c)      Parent shall file promptly (but in no event later
than ten (10) business days) after the Effective Time, a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) registering a number of
shares of Parent Stock to be issued in connection with the exercise of the New
Options and under the New Restricted Stock Units as determined in this Section
2.12 and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such options remain outstanding.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable (but in no event later than
ten (10) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the
holders of New Options and New Restricted Stock Units appropriate notices
setting forth (i) such holders' rights pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan
and (ii) that the agreements evidencing such options shall continue on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.12
after giving effect to the Merger).

         2.13     Warrants. At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to
Preferred Stock under Company Warrants that are then outstanding shall be
converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Stock, and Parent shall
assume each Company Warrant in accordance with the terms (as in effect on the
date hereof) of such Company Warrants. From and after the Effective Time, (a)
each Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock, (b), the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each
Company Warrant shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Preferred

                                       22
<PAGE>

Stock subject to each Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
would have been converted, had such Preferred Stock been converted to Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock, (c) the per
share exercise price under each such Company Warrant shall be adjusted by
dividing (i) the per share exercise price under each such Company Warrant,
assuming the Preferred Stock subject to each Company Warrant immediately prior
to the Effective Time had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest
cent, and (d) any restriction on exercise of any Company Warrant shall continue
in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, schedule and other
provisions of such Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided,
however, that such Company Warrant shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to the
Effective Time. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under
the Company Warrants or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.13 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company
Warrants have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically
provided herein.

         2.14     Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Parent,
Sub, and the Company will take all such reasonable lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement as promptly as practicable. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest Parent with full right, title and possession to all
the property, rights, privileges, power and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of Sub, Parent and the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

         2.15     Withholding. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Stockholder such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has announced to employees, former employees,
consultants or directors an intention to create, or otherwise created, a legally
binding commitment to adopt any additional Employee Plan which is intended to
cover employees or former employees of the Company (with respect to their
relationship with the Company) or to amend or modify any existing Employee Plan
which covers or has covered employees or former employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (with respect to their relationship with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries).

                  (j)      Unpaid Contributions. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any material liability for unpaid contributions under
Section 515 of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan, Multiemployer Plan or
Welfare Plan.

                  (k)      No Acceleration or Creation of Rights. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.19(c), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements by the Company nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the related transactions will result in the
acceleration or creation of any rights of any person to benefits under any
Employee Plan (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the vesting or
exercisability of any stock options, the acceleration of the vesting of any
restricted stock, the acceleration of the accrual or vesting of any benefits

implied, of any kind whatsoever against the Company or (c) any interest in any
property used by the Company.

         3.21     Compliance with Law. The Company has conducted the Business in
compliance with all applicable Regulations and Court Orders, except as would not
reasonably be expected to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has not received any notice to the effect that, or has otherwise been advised
that, the Company is not in compliance in any material respect with any such
Regulations or Court Orders, and the Company has no knowledge of any existing
circumstances likely to result in any material violation of any of the
foregoing.

         3.22     Proprietary Rights.

                  (a)      General. Schedule 3.22(a) sets forth with respect to

list of all Software incorporated in, provided with or otherwise necessary to
use, support and maintain, the Company's products, including all Software that
the Company provides or makes available to its customers, (vi) the identity of
all third parties to whom the Company has provided or disclosed Software source
code, including escrow agents, and (vii) for each mask work (if any), whether or

or made available to Parent. Schedule 3.22(a) also sets forth all third party
components, whether hardware, firmware or Software, that are incorporated in or
provided by the Company with Company's products, or any customized manufacturing
tooling that is otherwise necessary for the manufacture of the Company's
products.

                  (b)      Adequacy. The Proprietary Rights owned solely by the
Company or licensed by the Company pursuant to Licenses In listed on Schedule
3.11(a), together with the Licenses In that, pursuant to the parenthetical in
Section 3.11(a)(ii), are not required to be so listed, as well as any other
third party components purchased by the Company and incorporated in the
Company's products, constitute all Proprietary Rights necessary for the conduct
of the Business as presently conducted, including the design, manufacture,
license and sale of all products currently under development or in production,
and all such Proprietary Rights are free and clear of Encumbrances.

                  (c)      Royalties and Licenses. Except pursuant to Licenses
In, which are set forth in Schedule 3.11 or are permitted to be excluded from
such Schedule by the parenthetical in Section 3.11(a)(ii), the Company has no
obligation to compensate or account to any Person for the use of any of the
Company's Proprietary Rights.

                  (d)      Ownership. The Company owns all right, title and
interest in, or has a valid and enforceable right to use the Company's
Proprietary Rights, and such Proprietary Rights will not cease to be valid and
enforceable rights of the Company by reason of the execution,

                                       38
<PAGE>

delivery and performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Without
limiting the foregoing, the technology that the Company owns or purports to own
was: (i) developed by employees of the Company within the scope of their
employment; (ii) developed by independent contractors who have assigned their
rights to the Company pursuant to enforceable written agreements; or (iii)
otherwise acquired by the Company from a third party who assigned all
Proprietary Rights in the technology to the Company.

                  (e)      Absence of Claims. The Company has not received any
written notice alleging, or otherwise has no knowledge of (A) the invalidity
with respect to, any of the patents or trademarks of the Company or (B) any
alleged infringement, misappropriation or breach of any rights of others as a
result of the use, manufacture, development, exploitation, distribution, license
or support of the Software, products or technology of the Company. Neither the
Company's past or present operation of its business, including without
limitation any development, commercialization, manufacture, use, exploitation,
offer for sale, distribution, sale, license, or support of its Software,
products or technology, infringe upon or misappropriate the intellectual
property rights of any other Person anywhere in the world. In addition, no
Proprietary Rights that the Company has licensed from any other Person,
including without limitation pursuant to In-Licenses, to the knowledge of the
Company infringes any intellectual property rights of any other Person anywhere
in the world. Company has not received any written notice of any claims against
itself or its licensors claiming infringement or misappropriation of
intellectual property rights as a result of the technology licensed by the
Company from third parties. No Person (i) has notified the Company in writing
that it is claiming any ownership of or right to use any Proprietary Rights
which the Company purports to own or (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, is
infringing upon or misappropriating any such Proprietary Rights in any way.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(f), none of the software is, in whole or in
part, subject to the provisions of any open source or quasi-open source license
agreement, including without limitation, any of the following: (i) GNU's General
Public License ("GPL") or Lesser/Library GPL, (ii) The Artistic License (e.g.,
PERL), (iii) the Mozilla Public License, (iv) the Netscape Public License, (v)
the Berkeley software design ("BSD") license including Free BSD or BSD-style
license, (vi) the Sun Community Source License, (vii) an Open Source Foundation
License (e.g., CDE and Motif UNIX user interfaces), (viii) the Apache Server
license, or (ix) any other agreement obligating the Company to make source code
available to third parties or publish source code. The Company has no agreements
with, and is not subject to the requirements of any, standards bodies or other
entities that would obligate the Company to grant licenses to its Proprietary
Rights.

                  (f)      Protection of Proprietary Rights. All of the pending
applications for the Company's owned Proprietary Rights have been duly filed,
prosecution for such applications has been reasonably attended to and all
maintenance and related fees have been paid. The Company has taken reasonable
steps necessary or appropriate (including, entering into appropriate
confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with officers, directors,
subcontractors, Employees, licensees and customers in connection with the Assets
or the Business) to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of
Trade Secrets that are material to the Business. To the knowledge of the
Company, (i) there has been no misappropriation of any Trade Secrets or other
material confidential Proprietary Rights used in connection with the Business by
any person; (ii) no employee, independent contractor or agent of the Company has
misappropriated any Trade

                                       39
<PAGE>

Secrets of any other person in the course of performance as an employee,
independent contractor or agent of the Business; and (iii) no employee,
independent contractor or agent of the Company is in default or breach of any
term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, assignment of
invention agreement or similar agreement or contract relating in any way to the
protection, ownership, development, use or transfer of the Proprietary Rights.

                  (g)      Harmful Code. The Company has not intentionally
incorporated any disabling device or mechanism in the Software and, to the
knowledge of the Company, the Software is free of all viruses, worms, trojan
horses and other material known contaminants and does not contain any bugs,
errors, or problems that would substantially disrupt its operation or have a
substantial adverse impact on the operation of the Software.

                  (h)      Export Control. The Company has obtained all
approvals necessary for exporting the Company's products, including Software,
outside the United States in accordance with all applicable United States export
control regulations, and importing the products and Software into any country in
which the products and Software are now sold or licensed for use, and all such
export and import approvals in the United States and throughout the world are
valid, current, outstanding and in full force and effect.

         3.23     Tax Matters.

                  (a)      Filing of Tax Returns. The Company has timely filed
with the appropriate taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed
through the date hereof. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all
material respects. All Taxes shown due and payable on such Tax Returns have been
paid. The Company is not currently the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an authority
in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may
be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                  (b)      Payment of Taxes. The unpaid Taxes of the Company (i)
did not, as of the dates of the Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax
Liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in the Financial
Statements, and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for operations and
transactions through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since the date of the Most
Recent Financial Statements, the Company has not incurred any Liability for
Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with
past custom and practice.

                  (c)      Audits, Investigations or Claims. No deficiencies for
Taxes the Company have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any taxing or other
governmental authority. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any
Liability in respect of Taxes of the Company, and there are no matters under
discussion with any governmental authorities, or known to the Company with
respect to Taxes that are likely to result in an additional Liability for Taxes
with respect to the Company. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent complete and accurate copies of federal, state and local Tax Returns of
the Company and its predecessors for the years

                                       40
<PAGE>

ended December 31, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and complete and accurate copies
of all examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or
agreed to by the Company or any predecessors since December 31, 1999. Neither
the Company nor any predecessor has waived any statute of limitations in respect
of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, nor has any request been made in writing for any such extension or
waiver. No power of attorney (other than powers of attorney authorizing
employees of the Company to act on behalf of the Company) with respect to any
Taxes has been executed or filed with any Tax authority.

                  (d)      Liens. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes other than
Permitted Encumbrances on any assets of the Company.

                  (e)      Tax Elections. All material elections with respect to
Taxes affecting the Company as of the date hereof, to the extent such elections
are not shown on or in the Tax Returns that have been delivered or made
available to Parent, are set forth on Schedule 3.23(e). The Company (i) has not
consented at any time under former Section 341(f)(1) of the Code to have the
provisions of former Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of
the assets of the Company; (ii) has agreed, or is required, to make any
adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting
method or otherwise; (iii) has made an election, or is required, to treat any of
its assets as owned by another Person pursuant to the provisions of former
Section 168(f) of the Code or as tax-exempt bond financed property or tax-exempt
use property within the meaning of Section 168 of the Code; (iv) has acquired or
owns any assets that directly or indirectly secure any debt the interest on
which is tax exempt under Section 103(a) of the Code; (v) has made or will make
a consent dividend election under Section 565 of the Code; (vi) has elected at
any time to be treated as an S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361
or 1362 of the Code; or (vii) made any of the foregoing elections or is required
to apply any of the foregoing rules under any comparable state or local Tax
provision.

                  (f)      Tax Sharing Agreements. There are no Tax-sharing
agreements or similar arrangements (including indemnity arrangements) with
respect to or involving the Company, and, after the Closing Date, the Company
shall not be bound by any such Tax-sharing agreements or similar arrangements or
have any Liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the
Closing Date.

                  (g)      Other Entity Liability. The Company has never been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which is the Company). The Company has
no Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Taxes of the Company) (i)
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor, (iii) by contract, or
(iv) otherwise.

                  (h)      No Withholding. The Company has withheld and paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other
third party. The transaction contemplated herein is not subject to the tax
withholding provisions of Section 3406 of the Code, or of Subchapter A of
Chapter 3 of the Code or of any other provision of law.

                                       41
<PAGE>

                  (i)      USRPHC. The Company has never been a United State
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code.

                  (j)      Partnerships, Single Member LLCs, CFCs, PHCs and
PFICs. The Company (i) is not a partner for Tax purposes with respect to any
joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement or contract which is treated as
a partnership for Tax purposes, (ii) does not own a single member limited
liability company which is treated as a disregarded entity other than LLC, (iii)
is not a stockholder of a "controlled foreign corporation" as defined in Section
957 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv)
is not a "personal holding company" as defined in Section 542 of the Code (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), and (v) is not a "passive
foreign investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code.

and has not had a permanent establishment in any foreign country, as defined in
any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the United States of America and
such foreign country.

                  (l)      Disallowance of Interest Deductions. None of the
outstanding indebtedness of the Company constitutes indebtedness with respect to
which any interest deductions may be disallowed under Sections 163(i) or 163(l)
or 279 of the Code or under any other provision of applicable law.

                  (m)      International Boycotts. The Company has never
participated in and is not participating in an international boycott within the
meaning of Code Section 999.

                  (n)      Tax Shelters. The Company has not entered into any
transaction identified as a "listed transaction" for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.6011-4(b)(2) or 301.6111-2(b)(2). If the Company has
entered into any transaction such that, if the treatment claimed by it were to
be disallowed, the transaction would constitute a substantial understatement of
federal income tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662, then it believes
that it has either (x) substantial authority for the tax treatment of such
transaction or (y) disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant facts affecting the
tax treatment of such transaction.

                  (o)      Spin-Offs. The Company has not distributed the stock
of any corporation in a transaction satisfying the requirements of Section 355
of the Code since April 16, 1997, and the stock of the Company has not been
distributed in a transaction satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the
Code since April 16, 1997.

                  (p)      LLC Tax Treatment. At all times since its formation,
the Company's Subsidiary has been an entity with a single owner that is
disregarded as separate from its owner for federal tax purposes, and up to and
including the Closing Date, the Company's Subsidiary will be an entity with a
single owner that is disregarded as separate from its owner for federal tax
purposes. No Form 8832 has ever been filed with respect to the Company's
Subsidiary as other than a disregarded entity and, as of the Closing Date, no
such election shall have been made.

                  (q)      Deductibility of Payments. To the Company's
knowledge, there is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee or former employee of the

                                       42
<PAGE>

Company (with respect to such employee's relationship with the Company) that,
individually or collectively, requires the payment by the Company of any amount
(i) that is not deductible under Section 162(a)(1) or 404 of the Code or (ii)
that is an "excess parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.

         3.24     Reorganization Treatment.

                  (a)      Assets. At the Effective Time, the Company will hold
at least 90 percent of the fair market value of its net assets and at least 70
percent of the fair market value of its gross assets held immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by the
Company to dissenting Stockholders, amounts paid by the Company to Stockholders
who receive cash or other property, amounts used by the Company to pay Merger
expenses, amounts paid by the Company to redeem stock, securities, warrants or
options of the Company as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is part,
and amounts distributed by the Company to Stockholders (except for any regular,
normal dividends) as part of an overall plan of which the Merger is a part, in
each case will be treated as constituting assets of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

                  (b)      Business. The Company currently conducts a business.
Such business is the Company's "historic business" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d), and no assets of the Company have been
sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from
continuing the "historic business" of the Company or from using a "significant
portion" of the Company's "historic business assets" in a business following the
Merger, as such terms are used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d).

                  (c)      Investment Company. The Company is not an investment
company, as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

                  (d)      Title 11. The Company is not under the jurisdiction
of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section
368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

                  (e)      Redemptions and Distributions. Neither the Company
nor any person related to the Company within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) has purchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired, or made any distributions with respect to, any of the Company's stock
prior to or in contemplation of the Merger, or otherwise as part of a plan of
which the Merger is a part.

                  (f)      Intercorporate Indebtedness. At the Effective Time,
there will be no intercorporate indebtedness (including the Bridge Loan)
existing between Parent or the Sub, on one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, that was issued or acquired at a discount or will be settled at a discount
at the Effective Time, or to the knowledge of the Company, will thereafter be
settled at a discount.

                  (g)      Dividends. At the Effective Time, there will be no
accrued but unpaid dividends on the Common Stock or on the Preferred Stock.

                  (h)      Control. In the Merger, stock of the Company
representing "control" of the Company (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of
the Code) will be exchanged solely for

                                       43
<PAGE>

"voting stock" of Parent (within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and
(2)(E)). For purposes of the preceding sentence, any Common Stock to be
exchanged for cash or other property originating with Parent is treated as
constituting outstanding Common Stock at the Effective Time.

         3.25     Insurance. Schedule 3.25 contains a complete and accurate list
of all policies or binders of insurance (showing as to each policy or binder the
carrier, policy number, coverage limits, expiration dates, annual premiums, a
general description of the type of coverage provided and any pending claims
thereunder) of which the Company is the owner, insured or beneficiary. All of
such policies are sufficient for compliance in all material respects with all
Regulations and all of the Contracts. The Company is not in default under any of
such policies or binders, and has not failed to give any notice or to present
any material claim under any such policy or binder in a due and timely fashion.
There are no facts known to the Company upon which an insurer might be justified
in reducing or denying coverage or increasing premiums on existing policies or
binders. There are no outstanding unpaid claims under any such policies or
binders. Such policies and binders are in full force and effect on the date
hereof and shall be kept in full force and effect by the Company through the
Closing Date.

         3.26     Accounts Receivable.

                  (a)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.26, the accounts
and notes receivable reflected in the Most Recent Financial Statements, and all
accounts or notes receivable arising since the date of the Most Recent Financial
Statements, (i) represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales, services
performed or other charges arising on or before the date of recording thereof,
and (ii) are current and, the Company reasonably believes will be collected in

services performed which gave rise to said accounts were delivered or performed
in accordance in all material respects with the applicable orders, Contracts or
customer requirements.

                  (b)      Schedule 3.26(b) contains an accurate and complete
list as of October 27, 2003 of all loans and advances made by the Company to any
Employee, other than routine travel or relocation advances made to employees in
the ordinary course of business, which loans and advances do not materially
differ from the loans and advances as of the date of this Agreement.

         3.27     Customers. To the Company's knowledge, since the Balance Sheet
Date, there has been no actual or threatened termination of any material
customer account or group of accounts or actual or threatened material reduction
in purchases or royalties payable by any such customer or occurrence of any
event that is likely to result in any such termination or reduction, except as a
direct result of the announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         3.28     Suppliers. Schedule 3.28 sets forth a complete and accurate
list of the names and addresses of the ten (10) suppliers with the greatest
dollar volume of sales to the Company since January 1, 2003, showing the

materially reduce services or supplies to the Company.

         3.29     Brokers; Transaction Costs. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.29, the Company has not entered into any contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding with any Person which will result in the obligation of Parent or

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

         As an inducement of the Company to enter into this Agreement, except as
otherwise set forth in written disclosure schedules (the "Parent Schedules")
delivered to the Company on the date hereof, a copy of which is attached hereto,
Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows, which representations
and warranties are, as of the date hereof, and will be, as of the Closing Date,
true and correct. The Parent Schedules are numbered to correspond to the various
sections of this Article 4 setting forth certain exceptions to the
representations and warranties contained in this Article 4 and certain other
information called for by this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified, disclosure
made in any particular Parent Schedule shall be deemed made in any other Parent
Schedule or Schedules to which the relevance of such disclosure is readily
apparent from the text of such disclosure.

         4.1      Organization. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Parent
has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted. Parent is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is necessary under applicable law as a result of the conduct of
its business or the ownership of its properties and where the failure to be so
qualified would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. Sub has not engaged in
any business (other than in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby) since the date of its incorporation.

         4.2      Capitalization.

                                       46
<PAGE>

                  (a)      Parent has authorized under its Certificate of
Incorporation 885,000,000 shares of Parent Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share of which, as of October 30, 2003,
345,056,188 shares of Parent Stock and no shares of preferred stock were issued
and outstanding. Parent has no other stock authorized, issued or outstanding.

                  (b)      Except for Parent Options, there are no outstanding
options, warrants, convertible securities or rights of any kind to purchase or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent.

                  (c)      All outstanding shares of Parent Stock issued or to
be issued upon exercise of any of the Parent Options will be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any preemptive rights created
by statute, Parent's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any Contract.

         4.3      Valid Issuance of Merger Shares. The Merger Shares to be
issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement have been duly authorized and,
when issued in accordance with the terms hereof, will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.

         4.4      Authorization. Each of Parent and Sub has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party and has taken all corporate action necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to perform
its respective obligations hereunder and thereunder, including approval of the
Parent's Board of Directors. Approval of Parent's stockholders is not required
for Parent to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Parent and Sub, and this
Agreement is, and upon execution and delivery each of the Ancillary Agreements
to which each of Parent and Sub is a party will be, a valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Sub
in accordance with its terms, except that enforceability may be limited by the
effect of (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors or (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

         4.5      No Conflict or Violation; Consents. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.5, none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Parent or Sub with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof, will (a) violate or conflict with any provision of Parent's
or Sub's governing documents to the extent applicable, (b) violate, conflict
with, or result in a breach of or constitute a default (with or without notice
of passage of time) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the
performance required by, or result in a right to terminate, accelerate, modify
or cancel under, or require a notice under, or result in the creation of any
Encumbrance upon any of its assets under, any contract, lease, sublease,
license, sublicense, franchise, permit, indenture, agreement or mortgage for
borrowed money, instrument of indebtedness, security interest or other
arrangement to which Parent or Sub is a party or by which Parent or Sub is bound
or to which any of their respective assets are subject, (c) violate any
Regulation or Court Order applicable to Parent or Sub or (d) impose any
Encumbrance on any assets of Parent or Sub. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5,
no notices to, declaration, filing

                                       47
<PAGE>

or registration with, approvals or Consents of, or assignments by, any Persons
(including any federal, state or local governmental or administrative
authorities) are necessary to be made or obtained by Parent or Sub in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

         4.6      Reports and Financial Statements. Parent has timely filed all
reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, and has previously provided or made available to the Company
true and complete copies of all reports filed by Parent with the SEC since
January 1, 2002 (the "SEC Reports"). Such SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and none of such SEC
Reports, as of its date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The financial statements of Parent, including the notes
thereto, included in the SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied (except as otherwise stated in the footnotes to the
financial statements) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of Parent as at the dates thereof and
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.

         4.7      Reorganization Treatment.

                  (a)      Intention Regarding the Company. Parent has no plan
or intention: (i) to liquidate the Company; (ii) to merge the Company into
another corporation; (iii) to sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of stock
of the Company pursuant to the Agreement, except for transfers and successive
transfers described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k) or transfers and
successive transfers to one or more corporations controlled in each transfer by
the transferor corporation (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code);
or (iv) to cause the Company to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets,
except for (w) dispositions made in the ordinary course of business, (x)
transfers and successive transfers described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(k) or transfers and successive transfers to one or more corporations
controlled in each transfer by the transferor corporation (within the meaning of
Section 368(c) of the Code), (y) dispositions after which the Company would
continue to hold the amount of assets set forth in Section 3.24(a) following the
Merger (assuming the correctness of the representation set forth in Section
3.24(a)), or (z) transfers to partnerships that satisfy the provisions of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B).

                  (b)      Intention Regarding Parent Stock. Except with respect
to open-market purchases of Parent's stock pursuant to a general stock
repurchase program of Parent that has not been created or modified in connection
with the Merger, neither Parent nor any Person related to Parent within the
meaning of Treas. Reg. Sections 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) has any plan or
intention to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the stock of Parent
issued to the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement following the Merger.
Other than pursuant to this Agreement, neither Parent nor any Person related to
Parent within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sections 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and
(e)(5) has acquired any Common Stock or Preferred Stock in contemplation of the
Merger, or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part.

                                       48
<PAGE>

                  (c)      Control. Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in
control of Sub, and following the Merger, Parent will be in control of the
Company, within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code. Parent has no plan or
intention to cause the Company, after the Effective Time, to issue additional
shares of stock that would result in Parent losing control of the Company within
the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

                  (d)      Business. Assuming the correctness of the
representation set forth in 3.24(b), then following the Merger, Parent, or a
member of its qualified group of corporations (as defined by Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), will continue the historic business of the Company
(or, alternatively, if the Company has more than one line of business, will
continue at least one significant line of the Company's historic business) or
use a significant portion of the Company's historic business assets in a
business, in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)
(provided, however, that in the event that Section 3.24(b) is or has been
breached, this Section 4.6(d) shall not be considered to be or have been
breached).

                  (e)      Investment Company. Neither Parent nor Sub is an
"investment company" as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the
Code.

                  (f)      Assets. Assuming the correctness of the
representation set forth in Section 3.24(a), then following the Merger, the
Company will hold at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the Company's
net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the Company's
gross assets and at least 90 percent of the fair market value of Sub's net
assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of Sub's gross assets
held immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this
representation, amounts paid by the Company to dissenting Stockholders, amounts
paid by the Company to Stockholders who receive cash or other property, amounts
used by the Company to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid by the Company to
redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Company as part of any
overall plan of which the Merger is part, and amounts distributed by the Company
to Stockholders (except for any regular, normal dividends) as part of an overall
plan of which the Merger is a part, in each case will be treated as constituting
assets of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided,
however, that in the event that Section 3.24(a) is or has been breached, this
Section 4.6(g) shall not be considered to be or have been breached).

                  (g)      Intercorporate Indebtedness. At the Effective Time,
there will be no intercorporate indebtedness (including the Bridge Loan)
existing between Parent or the Sub, on one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, that was issued or acquired at a discount, or will be settled at a
discount at the Effective Time or to the knowledge of Parent will thereafter be
settled at a discount.

                  (h)      Control. In the Merger, stock of the Company
representing "control" of the Company (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of
the Code) will be exchanged solely for "voting stock" of Parent (within the
meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and (2)(E)). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, any Common Stock to be exchanged for cash or other property
originating with Parent is treated as constituting outstanding Common Stock at
the Effective Time.

shall furnish Parent and its Representatives and those of its lenders, upon
reasonable notice and in a timely manner, all financial, operating and other

information reasonably necessary to effectuate the Merger.

         5.3      Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any representation
or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any material failure of the Company
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that such disclosure shall

that occurs before the Closing that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

         5.4      Acquisition Proposals. From the date hereof until termination
of this Agreement pursuant to its terms (the "Exclusivity Period"), none of the
Company or any of its officers, directors, members, partners, employees,

initiate, entertain, encourage, discuss, accept or consider any inquiries,
offers or proposals from any person (other than Acquirer) which constitute, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish
any information regarding the Company to any Person in connection with or in

proposal or request for information either in writing or verbally with respect
to an Acquisition

                                       52
<PAGE>

Proposal is received by the Company or any of its officers, directors, members,
partners, employees, advisors, agents, financing sources (and their respective
advisors) and other representatives and affiliates during the Exclusivity
Period, the Company shall notify Parent immediately (orally and in writing) of
such receipt, and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the
offeror and the terms and conditions of any such indication of interest, letter
of intent, agreement, offer, proposal or request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company may enter into discussions with OEM's, resellers and/or merchants
regarding a potential commercial relationship.

use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Consent.

         5.6      Fairness Hearing; Registration of Shares. Parent, Sub and the
Company shall each take all steps reasonably necessary, utilize all commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperate with one another to obtain as promptly as
practicable the approval of the Commissioner of the California Department of
Corporations (the "Commissioner") of the fairness (the "Fairness Approval") of
the terms and conditions of the issuance of the Parent Stock as contemplated by
this Agreement after a hearing held pursuant to Section 25142 of the CCC and the
rules of the Commissioner thereunder. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
if the Company becomes aware that one of its stockholders intends to dissent or
object to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby at such hearing.
If for any reason whatsoever the Commissioner does not render a Fairness
Approval of the terms and conditions of the Merger and the issuance of the
Parent Stock as contemplated by this Agreement (or if Parent determines in its
reasonable judgment not to pursue such a hearing; provided that Parent shall
consult with the Company prior to making such determination), the parties hereto
agree to take all steps reasonably necessary, utilize all commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperate with one another to have the issuance of the
shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger registered with the SEC on
Form S-4 or a successor registration form (the "Registration Statement") by
filing with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the decision to utilize the
Registration Statement is made, the Registration Statement with respect to the
Parent Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, which shall be in form
and substance satisfactory to Parent (but with advance copies provided to the
Company for its review and comment, which such comments shall be promptly
conveyed by the Company). Each of Parent and the Company will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC. Each of
Parent and the Company will notify the other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or additional information, and will
supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between such party or
any of its representatives and the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement. As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC,
Parent shall file with the SEC an amendment to the Registration Statement and
Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to become effective as soon thereafter as
practicable. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company,
such amendment or supplement.

qualification requirements, and subject to any applicable break in service or
similar rule, to receive credit for all purposes including, without limitation,
eligibility to participate, matching contributions, and vesting under Parent
employee benefit plans for years of service with the Company (and its
subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing Date. If applicable, Parent
shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar)
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Parent employee benefit plan to be waived with and in
respect to such Company Participants and their eligible dependents and shall
provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or
similar payments) made during the plan year including the Closing Date for the
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar
requirements under any Parent employee benefit plan in which they are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date.

                  (b)      Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
the Company employees who become employees of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
may participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent (the
"Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP, and that
service with the Company shall be treated as service with Parent or its

Stock as determined pursuant to Exhibit J (such options and restricted stock
units, the "Additional Equity Awards"). The Company employees to whom Additional
Equity Awards are to be granted and the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to, and the terms of, each Additional Equity Award shall be determined by
Parent, in consultation with the Company.

         5.11     Bridge Loans. At any time and from time to time prior to
Closing, in the event the Company Board reasonably determines that the Company
requires additional funds for general corporate purposes through the Closing
Date, Parent shall loan such funds to the Company (the "Bridge Loan"), on the
terms and conditions set forth in the bridge loan agreement (including the
Security Agreement attached as Exhibit B thereto) attached as Exhibit K hereto
(the "Bridge Loan Agreement"). As a condition to such Bridge Loan, the Company
shall (a) execute and deliver the Bridge Loan Agreement and all documents
contemplated thereby, and (b) obtain all consents and approvals necessary for
the Company to enter into the Bridge Loan Agreement, including without
limitation, those consents required under the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and the Second Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement,

         5.15     Net Liabilities; Disputes. If Parent delivers written notice
to the Stockholder Representative within thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date, stating that Parent objects to the Company's determination of Net
Liabilities as specified in the Net Liabilities Certificate (the "Dispute
Notice") and specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt to resolve and finally
determine the amount of Net Liabilities within fifteen (15) days of the date on
which such Dispute Notice was delivered. If the Stockholder Representative and
Parent are unable to agree upon the amount of Net Liabilities within fifteen
(15) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm (the "Independent Accountant") shall be retained and
review the Net Liabilities Certificate and make a determination as to the amount
of Net Liabilities. Such determination shall be binding upon the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, and Parent, and Parent shall be
entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 of
this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 6

         6.1      Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date. Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date. Parent shall
permit the Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative. The Stockholders shall reimburse Parent for Taxes with respect
to such periods within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid
with respect to such periods, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected
in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on
the face of the balance sheet in the most recent Financial Statement (rather
than in any notes thereto), as such reserve is adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company in filing their Tax Returns;
provided, that Parent shall seek such reimbursement first from the Indemnity
Escrow Shares.

         6.2      Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. The
Stockholders shall pay to Parent within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion
of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the reserve
for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the
balance sheet in the most recent Financial Statement (rather than in any notes
thereto), as such reserve is adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in

                                       56
<PAGE>

accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries
of the Company in filing their Tax Returns; provided, that Parent shall seek
such reimbursement first from the Indemnity Escrow Shares. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, Taxes shall be allocated in the manner set forth in the last
sentence of Section 10.2(a)(ii).

         6.3      Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Company, the
Subsidiaries of the Company, the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the
Company, the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders agree (A) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company relating to any Taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of
the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing authority, (B) to deliver or make available to
Parent, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, copies of all such books
and records, and (C) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company,
the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records at such other
party's expense. Parent and the Stockholder Representative further agree, upon
request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not
limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

         6.4      Contest Provisions. If, subsequent to the Closing, any of
Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company receives notice of a Tax
Contest with respect to any Tax Return for a Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date, then within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of such notice, the Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative
of such notice. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to control
the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided, however, that if any
of the issues raised in such Tax Contest could have an impact on Taxes of the
Company for a Tax period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing
Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period"), then the Stockholder Representative shall
afford Parent the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of
the portion of such Tax Contest which could have an impact on Taxes of the
Company in any Post-Closing Tax Period. If the Stockholder Representative shall
have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but
elect in writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that Parent shall keep the
Stockholder Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis and
Parent shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on the Indemnifying Parties' indemnification
obligations under this Agreement without Stockholder Representative written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each

                                       57
<PAGE>

party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax Contest. "Tax
Contest" means any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or judicial
proceeding involving Taxes.

         6.5      Reorganization Matters.

                  (a)      The parties intend the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. However, neither Parent nor the
Company makes any representation or warranty to the other or to any Stockholder
regarding the tax treatment of the Merger or whether the Merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" under the Code. Each of the Company, the Stockholders and
Parent acknowledges that it is relying on its own advisors in connection with
the Tax treatment of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company, the Stockholders and Parent each agree to use their
respective best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any
actions which to their knowledge could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  (b)      This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the
parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of
Parent and the Company shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

         6.6      Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Stockholders when due, and
the Stockholders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by
applicable law, Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Stockholders
shall (i) provide Parent with evidence satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer
Taxes have been paid by the Stockholders and (ii) use their best efforts to
provide Parent at Closing with a clearance certificate or similar document(s)
which may be required by any state taxing authority to relieve Parent of any
obligation to withhold any portion of the payments to the Stockholders pursuant
to this Agreement.

         6.7      FIRPTA Certificate. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a form of notice to the Internal Revenue
Service in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h)(2) and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent along
with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to the
Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Company upon the Closing of the
Merger.

of the Closing Date (the "Tax and Financial Statement Claim Expiration Date").
No investigation made by any of the parties hereto (whether prior to, on or

with, or related to, the breach of any warranty, representation, covenant or
agreement of the Company or any schedule hereto or in any certificate or
instrument of conveyance delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to make any indemnification payment
pursuant to this Section 10.2(a)(i) unless a Claim is initiated prior to the Tax
and Financial Statement Claim Expiration Date (for claims for breaches of
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.14 and 3.23 hereof) or

differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the balance sheets
(rather than

                                       62
<PAGE>

in any notes thereto) contained in the most recent Financial Statements, as such
reserve is adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with past custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
filing their Tax Returns, and (ii) the unpaid Taxes of any Person (other than
any of the Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax
period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in
the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal
to the amount which would by payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date.

         The term "Damages" as used in this Section 10.2 is not limited to
matters asserted by third parties against Parent Indemnified Parties, but
includes Damages incurred or sustained by such Persons in the absence of third
party claims.

                  (b)      Procedure for Claims.

                  If a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2 (a
"Claim") is to be made by a Parent Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification
hereunder, the Parent Indemnified Party claiming such indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Stockholder Representative promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of
any fact, condition or event which the Company reasonably anticipates may give
rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 10.2,
and such Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the individual items of
Damages, the basis for the anticipated liability and the nature of the breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to such Damages. The
failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder shall not
affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except and only to the extent that,
the Indemnifying Party is damaged or prejudiced in any material respect by such
failure, and then only to the extent thereof. In the case of a Claim brought
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) involving the assertion of a claim by a third
party (whether pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise, but not
including any Tax Contest, a "Third-Party Claim"), if the Indemnifying Party
shall acknowledge in writing to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the terms of
its indemnity hereunder in connection with such Third-Party Claim, then (A) the
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled and, if it so elects, shall be
obligated at its own cost, risk and expense, (1) to take control of the defense
and investigation of such Third-Party Claim and (2) to pursue the defense
thereof in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings promptly taken or
instituted and diligently pursued, including, without limitation, to employ and
engage attorneys of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party to handle and defend the same, and (B) the Stockholder Representative
shall be entitled (but not obligated), if it so elects, to compromise or settle
such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
In the event the

                                       63
<PAGE>

Stockholder Representative elects to assume control of the defense and
investigation of such lawsuit or other legal action in accordance with this
Section 10.2(b), the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense,
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third-Party Claim;
provided that, if the named persons to a lawsuit or other legal action include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party
has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled, at the Indemnified Party's cost, risk and expense (if such
Claim represents Damages for which indemnification is due), to retain one firm
of separate counsel of its own choosing. If the Stockholder Representative fails
to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section
10.2(b) within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party against which such Third-Party Claim has been asserted shall
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the Stockholder Representative) have
the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Party's cost, risk and expense (if
such Claim represents Damages for which indemnification is due), the defense,
compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the
account of the Indemnifying Party; provided that such Third-Party Claim shall
not be compromised or settled without the written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
the Stockholder Representative assumes the defense of the claim, the Stockholder
Representative shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in the event the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party shall
keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed of the progress of any
such defense, compromise or settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for any settlement of any Third-Party Claim effected pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section 10.2(b) and for any final judgment (subject to any
right of appeal).

                  (c)      Indemnity Escrow Shares Sole Recourse.

         With respect to each claim for indemnity under this Section 10.2, the
liability of each Indemnifying Party shall be limited to his pro rata portion of
the claim amount, in proportion to the proportionate ownership of the Common
Stock and Preferred Stock immediately prior the Effective Date. In no event
shall any Indemnifying Party's obligation to provide indemnification exceed the
amount of such Indemnifying Party's interest in the Indemnity Escrow Shares (the
"Damage Cap"); provided, however, that the Damage Cap shall not apply in the
case of a claim related to a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.14 or 3.23 or a claim pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(ii).
For purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Stock to be delivered
to a Parent Indemnified Party out of the escrow account, the Indemnity Escrow
Shares shall be valued at the Closing Price.

         10.3     No Right of Contribution. After the Closing, the Indemnifying
Parties shall have no right of contribution against the Surviving Corporation
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company.

         10.4     Threshold; Limitations on Indemnity.

                                       64
<PAGE>

         With respect to Claims made pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i), the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover for any Damages from the
Indemnity Escrow Shares until such time as the Damages claimed by the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to such Sections in the aggregate exceed an amount
equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate value of the Indemnity Escrow Shares,
valued at the Closing Price (the "Damage Threshold"), at which time the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated
and reimbursed for all such Damages, including the initial one percent (1%)
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Damage Threshold shall not apply in
the case of a claim related to a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 3.14 or 3.23 or in the case of a claim made pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(ii).

         10.5     Stockholder Representative; Power of Attorney.

                  (a)      Stockholder Representative. In the event that the
Merger is approved by the Stockholders, effective upon such vote, and without
further act of any Stockholder, the Stockholder Representative shall for each
Stockholder (other than stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their
dissenters' rights under the DGCL) enter into the Indemnity Escrow Agreement,
and take all actions required or permitted under the Indemnity Escrow Agreement
or this Agreement with respect to the interests and rights of the Stockholders
with respect to the indemnity under this Article 10. Such agency may be changed
by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative
may not be removed unless holders of a majority of the Indemnity Escrow Shares
agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted Stockholder
Representative. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be
filled by approval of the holders of a majority of the Indemnity Escrow Shares.
No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall not receive compensation for his services. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice
to or from each of the Stockholders.

                  (b)      Exculpation. The Stockholder Representative shall not
be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. The Stockholders (other than stockholders, if any,
as shall have perfected their dissenters' rights under the DGCL) shall jointly
and severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad
faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, which
may be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Shares, if any, after all claims by the
Parent Indemnified Parties have been satisfied.

                  (c)      Actions of the Stockholder Representative. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute a decision for all of the Stockholders for whom a portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Shares otherwise issuable to them are deposited with the
Depositary Agent pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each of such Stockholders, and the Depositary Agent
and Parent may rely exclusively upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of every such

                                       65
<PAGE>

Stockholder. The Depositary Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1     Termination.

                  (a)      This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

                           (i)      By the written agreement of Parent and the
Company;

                           (ii)     By Parent or the Company if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before February 28, 2004 or if the satisfaction of
any condition set forth in Article 7 or Article 8 on or before such date is or
becomes impossible, other than due to a breach of this Agreement by the party
seeking to terminate; unless Parent has not received the Fairness Approval or if
the parties have not received the requisite governmental Consents (set forth in
Sections 7.3 and 8.3 herein), in which case such date shall be extended to April
30, 2004;

                           (iii)    By Parent or the Company if there shall be a
final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect preventing
consummation of the Merger.

                  (b)      In the event of termination of this Agreement:

                           (i)      The provisions of this Article XI and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; and

agrees with each other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity to
be represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had

                                       67
<PAGE>

         11.6     Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement,
together with the Ancillary Agreements and all exhibits and schedules hereto,
and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the
parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the parties. No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. No
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

         11.7     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and may be delivered by facsimile transmission, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

         11.8     Invalidity. In the event that any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to
herein, shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision of this Agreement or any other such instrument.

         11.9     Expenses. Each party will pay for its own legal, accounting
and other costs and expenses incurred with respect to the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, except that upon the consummation of the Merger,
Parent shall assume the Company's legal, accounting, financial advisory and
other professional costs and expenses incurred with respect to the negotiation,
execution and consummation of this Agreement.

         11.10    Publicity. Neither party shall issue any press release or make
any public statement regarding the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior approval of the other parties, and the parties hereto shall issue a
mutually acceptable press release as soon as practicable after the date hereof
and after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be
permitted to make any public statement without obtaining the consent of the
Company if (i) the disclosure is required by law or the requirements of NASDAQ
National Market and (ii) Parent has first used its reasonable efforts to consult
with (but not to obtain the consent of) the Company about the form and substance
of such disclosure.

         11.11    No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, by way of subrogation, except
as specifically set forth in Article 10 hereof.

         11.12    Dispute Resolution. The parties hereby agree that, in order to
obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of any disputes under this Agreement,
each claim, dispute or controversy of whatever nature, arising out of, in
connection with, or in relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including without
limitation any claim based on contract, tort or statute, or the arbitrability of
any claim hereunder (an "Arbitrable Claim"), shall be settled by final and
binding arbitration conducted in San Francisco, California. All such Arbitrable
Claims shall be settled by three (3) arbitrators in

                                       68
<PAGE>

accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Such arbitrators shall be provided through AAA
by mutual agreement of the parties; provided, that, absent such agreement, the
arbitrators shall be appointed by AAA. In either event, such arbitrators may not
have any preexisting, direct or indirect relationship with any party to the
dispute. EACH PARTY HERETO EXPRESSLY CONSENTS TO, AND WAIVES ANY FUTURE
OBJECTION TO, SUCH FORUM AND ARBITRATION RULES. Judgment upon any award may be
entered by any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Except as
required by law (including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the
SEC and the NASDAQ National Market if applicable), neither party nor the
arbitrators shall disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration
hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties. Adherence to this
dispute resolution process shall not limit the right of the parties hereto to
obtain any provisional remedy, including injunctive or similar relief, from any
court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary to protect their respective
rights and interests pending arbitration. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING
SENTENCE, THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE IS INTENDED TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE
METHOD OF RESOLVING ANY ARBITRABLE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT. The arbitration procedures shall follow the substantive law of the
State of California, including the provisions of statutory law dealing with
arbitration, as it may exist at the time of the demand for arbitration, insofar
as said provisions are not in conflict with this Agreement and specifically
excepting therefrom sections of any such statute dealing with discovery and
sections requiring notice of the hearing date by registered or certified mail.
The arbitrators shall determine the prevailing party and shall include in their
award that party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

         11.13    Waiver of Jury Trial. Consistent with the intention of Section
11.12, each signatory to this Agreement hereby waives its respective right to a
jury trial of any permitted claim or cause of action arising out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or any dealings between
any of the signatories hereto relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The scope of this waiver is
intended to be all encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any
court and that relate to the subject matter of this agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, contract
claims, tort claims, and all other common law and statutory claims. This waiver
is irrevocable, meaning that it may not be modified either orally or in writing,
and this waiver shall apply to any subsequent amendments, supplements or other
modifications to this agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
to any other document or agreement relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

         11.14    Service of Process; Consent to Jurisdiction.

                  (a)      SERVICE OF PROCESS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY PROCESS, PLEADING, NOTICES OR OTHER
PAPERS BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED, CERTIFIED OR FIRST CLASS
MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN,
OR BY ANY OTHER METHOD PROVIDED OR PERMITTED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

                  (b)      CONSENT AND JURISDICTION. EACH PARTY HERETO
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY (I) AGREES THAT ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE

                                       69
<PAGE>

BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF
CALIFORNIA OR, IF SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OR WILL NOT ACCEPT
JURISDICTION, IN ANY COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA,
CALIFORNIA; (II) CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY SUCH COURT IN ANY SUCH
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (III) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH
COURT.

         11.15    Attorney Fees. If any party to this Agreement brings an action
to enforce its rights under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions
hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its actual
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees reasonably incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action.
