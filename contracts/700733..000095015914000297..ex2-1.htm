Notwithstanding the foregoing, (X) the number of shares of TF Financial Common

shares of TF Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time (the "Aggregate Cash Consideration"), and (Y) the number of shares of TF

Stock Consideration at the Effective Time (the "Aggregate Common Stock
Consideration") shall be equal to sixty percent (60%) of the total number of

Time.

  

  

(b) Election Procedures. National Penn and TF Financial shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail an Election Form together with the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement to holders of TF Financial Common Stock as of the record date for
the TF Financial Shareholders Meeting. Each Election Form shall permit the
holder (or in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through

have reasonable discretion to (i) determine whether any Election, modification
or revocation is received, (ii) determine whether any Election, modification
or revocation has been properly made, and (iii) disregard immaterial defects
in any Election Form. Good faith determinations made by the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither National Penn,

any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

(e) Allocation. The Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation among the
holders of TF Financial Common Stock of rights to receive National Penn Common
Stock or cash in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

  

  

(i) Aggregate Cash Consideration Under Subscribed. If the amount of cash
represented by the aggregate Cash Election Shares is less than the Aggregate
Cash Consideration, then:

  

  

(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration;

  

  

(B) No-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the
extent necessary to have the amount of cash represented by the aggregate Cash
Election Shares equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. If less than all of
the No-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash Election Shares, then the
Exchange Agent shall deem a pro rata portion of the TF Financial Common Stock
of each holder who holds No-Election Shares as Cash Election Shares. All
remaining No-Election Shares shall thereafter be treated as Common Stock
Election Shares;

  

  

(C) If all of the No-Election Shares are treated as Cash Election Shares under
the preceding Subsection and the amount of cash represented by the aggregate
Cash Election Shares remains less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then
the Exchange Agent shall convert, on a pro rata basis described in Subsection
2.2(e)(iv) below, a sufficient number of Common Stock Election Shares into
Cash Election Shares ("Reallocated Cash Shares") such that the amount of cash
represented by the aggregate Cash Election Shares, including the Reallocated
Cash Shares, equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and thereafter all
Reallocated Cash Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration; and

  

  

(D) the Common Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration.

  

  

(ii) Aggregate Cash Consideration Oversubscribed. If the amount of cash
represented by the aggregate Cash Election Shares is more than the Aggregate
Cash Consideration, then:

  

  

(A) all Common Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration;

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 14 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(B) the Exchange Agent shall convert, on a pro rata basis described in
Subsection 2.2(e)(iv) below, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares into
Common Stock Election Shares ("Reallocated Common Stock Shares") such that the
amount of cash represented by the remaining aggregate Cash Election Shares
equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and thereafter all Reallocated Common
Stock Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock
Consideration; and

  

  

(C) the Cash Election Shares which are not Reallocated Common Stock Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

  

  

(iii) Aggregate Cash Consideration and Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
Satisfied. If the amount of cash represented by the aggregate Cash Election
Shares is equal to the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then Subsections (e)(i)
and (ii) shall not apply, and all Cash Election shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration and all Common Stock Election
Shares and all No-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Common Stock Consideration.

  

  

(iv) Pro Rata Reallocations. If the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to
Subsection 2.2(e)(i)(C) to convert some Common Stock Election Shares into
Reallocated Cash Shares, each holder of Common Stock Election Shares shall be
allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Cash Shares. If the
Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Subsection 2.2(e)(ii)(B) to convert
some Cash Election Shares into Reallocated Common Stock Shares, each holder of
Cash Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the total
Reallocated Common Stock Shares.

  

  

2.3 Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by TF Financial. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, each share of TF Financial Common Stock
which is either issued and held in the treasury of TF Financial or issued and
held by TF Financial or its Subsidiaries (other than shares held in an agency
or fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) as of the
Effective Time, if any, shall be cancelled, and no cash, stock or other
property shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

2.4 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fraction of a share of National Penn Common Stock and no
certificates or scrip therefor will be issued in the Merger; instead, National
Penn shall pay to each holder of TF Financial Common Stock who would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a share of National Penn Common Stock an amount
in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying such fraction
by the average closing price of a share of National Penn Common Stock on
NASDAQ for the 10 full trading days ending on the third Business Day prior to
the Effective Date.

  

  

2.5 Stock Options. Each option to purchase TF Financial Common Stock (each a
"TF Financial Option") granted under the TF Financial Option Plans, whether
vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the
Effective Time, fully vest (to the extent not vested) and be canceled and, on
the Effective Date, TF Financial shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an
amount determined by multiplying (i) the positive difference, if any, between
the Cash Consideration and the exercise price of such TF Financial Option by
(ii) the number of shares of TF Financial Common Stock subject to such TF
Financial Option. No consideration shall be paid hereunder in respect of
shares of TF Financial Common Stock subject to a TF Financial Option which has
an exercise price equal to or greater than the Cash Consideration. Prior to
the payment of such amount to any TF Financial option holder in connection
with the cancellation of the TF Financial Options, such option holder shall
execute a cancellation agreement, substantially in the form set forth in
Section 2.5 of the TF Financial Disclosure Schedule.

2.2(b), Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e), sufficient cash to pay the Aggregate
Cash Consideration, and, to the extent determinable, an amount of cash

Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable for the shares
represented thereby.

Section 2.6(b).

  

  

(b) Any statement evidencing book-entry shares issued in exchange for TF
Financial Certificates pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above shall be dated the
Effective Date and any holder shall be entitled to dividends and all other
rights and privileges pertaining to such shares of stock from the Effective
Date. Until surrendered, each TF Financial Certificate shall, from and after
the Effective Date, evidence solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

(c) If a TF Financial Certificate is exchanged on a date following one or more
record dates after the Effective Date for the payment of dividends or any
other distribution on shares of National Penn Common Stock, National Penn
shall pay to such shareholder cash in an amount equal to dividends payable on
such shares of National Penn Common Stock received in exchange for TF
Financial Certificates and pay or deliver any other distribution to which such
shareholder is entitled. No interest shall accrue or be payable in respect of
dividends or any other distribution otherwise payable under this Section
2.6(c) upon surrender of TF Financial Certificates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party hereto shall be liable to any holder of TF Financial
Common Stock for any amount paid in good faith to a public official or agency
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Until
such time as TF Financial Certificates are surrendered to National Penn for
exchange or the Exchange Agent has received all necessary documents to
evidence a lost, stolen or destroyed TF Financial Certificate including any
bond that may be required pursuant to Section 2.6(g), as applicable, National
Penn shall have the right to withhold dividends or any other distributions on
the shares of National Penn Common Stock issuable to such shareholder.

  

  

(d) Each TF Financial Certificate delivered for exchange under this Section
2.6 must be endorsed in blank by the registered holder thereof or accompanied
by a power of attorney to transfer such shares endorsed in blank by such
holder.

  

  

(e) Upon the Effective Time, the stock transfer books for TF Financial Common
Stock will be closed and no further transfers of TF Financial Common Stock
will thereafter be made or recognized. All TF Financial Certificates
surrendered pursuant to this Section 2.6 will be cancelled.

  

  

(f) If there is a transfer of ownership of TF Financial Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of TF Financial, a statement of book-
entry shares evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of
National Penn Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(c), as applicable and
appropriate, may be issued with respect to such TF Financial Common Stock to
such a transferee if the TF Financial Certificate representing such shares of
TF Financial Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  

  

(g) If any TF Financial Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed TF Financial Certificate, upon the making of a sworn affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof in form satisfactory to the Exchange Agent,
the Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Exchange Agent may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to the delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the
holder of such TF Financial Certificate is entitled as a result of the Merger,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed TF Financial Certificate
to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against TF Financial, National Penn or the Exchange
Agent or any other party with respect to the TF Financial Certificate alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.7 Anti-Dilution Provisions. If National Penn shall, at any time before the
Effective Date:

  

  

(a) declare a dividend in shares of National Penn Common Stock with a record
date prior to the Effective Date;

  

  

(b) resolve to combine the outstanding shares of National Penn Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares;

  

  

(c) resolve to effect a split or subdivide the outstanding shares of National
Penn Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Date; or

  

  

(d) reclassify the shares of National Penn Common Stock;

  

  

then, in any such event, the number of shares of National Penn Common Stock to
be delivered to TF Financial shareholders who are entitled to receive shares
of National Penn Common Stock in exchange for shares of TF Financial Common
Stock shall be adjusted so that each TF Financial shareholder shall be
entitled to receive such number of shares of National Penn Common Stock as
such shareholder would have been entitled to receive if the Effective Date had
occurred prior to the happening of such event. (By way of illustration, if
National Penn shall declare a stock dividend of 3% payable with respect to a
record date on or prior to the Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted upward by 3%.). In addition, in the event that, prior to the
Effective Date, National Penn enters into an agreement pursuant to which
shares of National Penn Common Stock would be converted into shares or other
securities or obligations of another corporation, proper provision shall be
made in such agreement so that each TF Financial shareholder entitled to
receive shares of National Penn Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled
to receive, pro rata, such number of shares or other securities or amount or
obligations of such other corporation as such shareholder would be entitled to
receive if the Effective Date had occurred immediately prior to the happening
of such event.

5.5 No Solicitation. TF Financial shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit
any of its officers, directors or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it
to:

  

  

(a) initiate, solicit, encourage (including by way of furnishing information),
or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal which constitutes any Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein);

  

  

(b) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any
Person in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal; or

  

  

(c) agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

TF Financial shall notify National Penn immediately and in no event later than
within two (2) Business Days of receipt, in reasonable detail, as to any
inquiries and proposals which it or any of its representatives or agents may
receive of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public information
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, including, in each case, the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the terms and
conditions thereof, and shall provide to National Penn any written materials
received by TF Financial or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith,
unless (X) such materials constitute confidential information of the party
making such offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement,
(Y) disclosure of such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or
(Z) disclosure of such materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree. TF Financial will keep National Penn informed of any
developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry
immediately and in no event later than within two (2) Business Days upon the
occurrence thereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 55 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) TF Financial may furnish or cause to be furnished confidential and non-
public information concerning TF Financial and its businesses, properties or
assets to, and may engage in discussions or negotiations, with a third party
in response to an Acquisition Proposal submitted by such third party;

  

  

(ii) following receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, TF Financial may take and
disclose to its shareholders a position with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

  

  

but, in respect of the foregoing clauses (i) through (ii), only if (A) the
Board of Directors of TF Financial shall conclude in good faith after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that failure to do so
would result in a breach by such directors of their fiduciary duties to TF
Financial's shareholders; (B) the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or the
Board of Directors of TF Financial determines it is reasonably expected to
result in a Superior Proposal; (C) TF Financial has not breached any of the
covenants set forth in this Section 5.5; and (D) TF Financial has entered into
a confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such third party
than the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

As used herein, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means a bona fide proposal
(including a written communication that is or becomes the subject of public
disclosure) for: (a) any merger, consolidation or acquisition involving all or
substantially all the assets or liabilities of TF Financial, any TF Financial
Subsidiary, or any other business combination involving TF Financial or any TF
Financial Subsidiary; (b) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning
twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity securities of TF Financial
or any of its Subsidiaries; or (c) a transaction involving the transfer of
beneficial ownership of securities representing, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership or to vote securities representing, 20% or more of the
then outstanding shares of TF Financial Common Stock or the then outstanding
shares of common stock of any TF Financial Subsidiary.

  

  

5.6 Update of Disclosure Schedules. Through the Closing Date, TF Financial
shall update the TF Financial Disclosure Schedule, and National Penn shall

the occurrence of any event which, if such event had occurred prior to the
date hereof, would have been disclosed on such schedule.

  

  

5.7 Takeover Laws. No party will take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Laws and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those
transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of,
any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect.

  

  

5.8 Shareholder Litigation. TF Financial shall give National Penn the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation against TF Financial and/or its directors or
Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without National Penn's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

5.9 Advice of Changes. TF Financial shall promptly advise National Penn of any
change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with other such
changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein, provided, however, that any
noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the failure to be
satisfied of a condition set forth in Article 6 or give rise to any right of
termination under Article 7 unless the underlying breach shall independently
constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right.

  

  

5.10 ISRA. TF Financial, at its sole cost and expense, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, either (i) a
written opinion from its counsel (based upon an affidavit from TF Financial
that is approved by National Penn) that the transactions contemplated by, or
the properties subject to, this Agreement are not subject to the requirements
of ISRA, or (ii) a Remediation Certification (in form and substance
satisfactory to National Penn) prepared by a New Jersey Licensed Site
Remediation Professional ("LSRP") pursuant to ISRA authorizing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the
issuance of any "Negative Declaration," "Response Action Outcome" or approval
of any "Remedial Action Workplan," as such terms are defined under ISRA and
SRRA, or (iii) an approval of a Remedial Action Workplan (in form and
substance satisfactory to National Penn), or (iv) issuance of a Negative

extent that such property renders the provisions of ISRA applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. TF Financial will obtain and
maintain a "Remediation Funding Source," as such term is defined under BCSRA,
or other financial assurance in form and amount approvable by the LSRP and the
NJDEP as required in furtherance of TF Financial's obligations under this
Section 5.10.

parties hereto that holders of National Penn Common Stock and TF Financial
Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend,
for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of National Penn
Common Stock and/or TF Financial Common Stock or any shares of National Penn

(a) ESOP. As soon as practicable and in no event later than five (5) Business
Days before Closing, 3rd Fed Bank shall adopt an amendment to the ESOP (the
"ESOP Amendment") consistent with the ESOP plan document at Section 8.2(c) as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement providing that, upon the Closing
and subject to the consummation of the Merger, (i) the ESOP shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, (ii) no new participants shall be admitted
to the ESOP after the Closing, (iii) all ESOP participants' accounts shall be
fully vested and 100% non-forfeitable on and after the Closing, and (iv) to
the extent feasible, but in no case prior to the Determination Date, the
Trustee of the ESOP shall sell prior to the Effective Time a number of shares
of TF Financial Common Stock held in the ESOP suspense account to the extent
necessary to obtain cash proceeds at least equal to the remaining ESOP
indebtedness, and to the extent that such per share sale price for such ESOP
shares is less than the per share Cash Consideration for such shares, then TF
Financial shall make an additional cash contribution to the ESOP so that the
ESOP Trust shall not receive less than the per share Cash Consideration for
such shares sold prior to the Effective Time; (v) in the event the cash sales
proceeds from the TF Financial Common Stock in the ESOP suspense account are
less than the then outstanding ESOP indebtedness, TF Financial or 3rd Fed Bank
shall make an additional cash contribution to the ESOP so that the suspense
account has sufficient cash to repay the then outstanding ESOP indebtedness;
(vi) the ESOP Trustee shall use the cash proceeds from the sale of such TF
Financial Common Stock and any cash contribution required by clause (v) above
to repay in full all outstanding ESOP indebtedness, and (vii) the ESOP shall
be terminated in accordance with Section 8.2(c) of the ESOP plan document as
in effect as of the date of the Agreement, including that all employer
contributions, dividends on company stock and earnings on participant account
assets paid to the ESOP Trust or earned by the ESOP Trust since the most
recent valuation date shall be allocated to the accounts of all ESOP
participants as of the date of termination of the ESOP as if it were the next
valuation date in accordance with the provisions of the ESOP; and all assets
realized by the ESOP Trust with respect to any company stock remaining as
collateral on any acquisitions loans which shall be exchanged in the Merger
after repayment of all exempt loans shall have been made shall be allocated as
ESOP Trust earnings to the accounts of all participants pro rata based on the
total value of assets allocated to each participant's account as a percentage
of the total value of all assets allocated to all participant accounts held in
the ESOP Trust as of the date of termination of the ESOP. 3rd Fed Bank shall
continue to accrue and make contributions to the ESOP for the plan year ending
as of the date of termination of the ESOP in accordance with the share
acquisition loan amortization schedule in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, including a pro rata contribution for any partial contribution
period ending as of the termination date of the ESOP to the extent necessary
for the ESOP Trustee to meets its obligations under the loan amortization
schedule.

  

  

(b) 401(k) Plan. The 3rd Fed Bank board of directors shall adopt a resolution
providing that the 3rd Fed Bank 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") shall be
terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
consummation of the Merger. TF Financial shall continue to accrue and make
contributions on behalf of each participant in the 401(k) Plan in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice. As soon as administratively
practicable following the termination of the 401(k) Plan, the account balances
of all participants and beneficiaries in the 401(k) Plan shall be either
distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible
tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct in accordance with the terms of the plan

will enter the Pension Plan after the freeze date; (ii) no additional years of
credited service for benefit accrual purposes will be earned after the freeze
date under the Pension Plan; and (iii) compensation earned by participants
after the freeze date will not be taken into account under the Pension Plan.

freeze the Pension Plan in accordance with ERISA and the Pension Plan,
including providing participants all required notices.

(d) TF Financial shall continue to accrue and make payments under the TF
Financial annual incentive compensation plan in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice.

  

  

(e) Prior to and as of the Effective Time, TF Financial shall continue to make
payments to employees which become earned and payable under any employment or
change in control severance agreement or severance policy of TF Financial or
3rd Fed Bank existing as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of such agreement or policy. TF Financial and 3rd Fed Bank employees
that terminate employment on or before the Effective Time shall be paid for
any accrued but unused vacation time, paid time off and personal days at the
employee\'s then-current rate of pay to the extent such amounts were accrued
prior to the date of such payment and payable in the ordinary course and
consistent with past practice. Section 5.12(e) of the TF Financial Disclosure
Schedule sets forth all amounts due and payable as a result of the Merger and
the Contemplated Transactions under the Change in Control Severance Agreement
dated January 1, 2009, as amended December 31, 2013, between 3rd Fed Bank and

National Penn shall take all such steps as may be required or appropriate to
cause the Contemplated Transactions, and any other dispositions of equity
securities of TF Financial (including derivative securities) or acquisitions
of equity securities of National Penn in connection with the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, by each director or officer of TF Financial who
becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to National Penn to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. TF Financial shall promptly furnish National Penn with
all requisite information necessary for National Penn to take the actions
contemplated by this Section 5.13, which information shall be accurate in all
material respects.

Shareholders Meeting to be held as soon as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for purposes of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby. TF Financial shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain
the votes of the TF Financial shareholders in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Board
of Directors of TF Financial shall recommend approval of such transactions by
such shareholders and TF Financial shall include such recommendation in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement. In connection with the TF Financial Shareholders
Meeting, National Penn and TF Financial shall cooperate in the preparation of
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and, with the approval of each of National Penn
and TF Financial (which approvals will not be unreasonably withheld), TF

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, TF Financial's Board of Directors may, if it
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors) that the failure to do so would cause it to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation that the shareholders of TF Financial approve this Agreement in
a manner adverse to National Penn (a "Change of Recommendation"); provided
that prior to any such Change of Recommendation, TF Financial shall have
complied in all material respects with Section 5.5, given National Penn
written notice promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
advising it of the decision of TF Financial's Board of Directors to take such
action and, in the event the decision relates to an Acquisition Proposal,
given National Penn the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal, including the identity of the person making any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry; and provided, further, that in the event the decision relates to an
Acquisition Proposal: (i) TF Financial shall have given National Penn three
(3) Business Days after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and if National Penn
proposes to revise the terms of this Agreement, TF Financial shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate, in good faith with National Penn with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal; and (ii) TF Financial's Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications
made or agreed to by National Penn, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event TF Financial's Board of
Directors does not make the determination that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and thereafter determines not to withdraw,
modify or change its recommendation that the shareholders of TF Financial
approve this Agreement in connection with a new Acquisition Proposal, the
procedures referred to above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any
subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change. In the event of any material
revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that result in terms that are less
favorable to TF Financial, then TF Financial shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to National Penn and to again comply with the requirements
of this Section 5.14(a) with respect to such new written notice, except that
the three (3) Business Day period referred to above shall be reduced to two
(2) Business Days. In addition to the foregoing, TF Financial shall not submit
to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the
Merger.

  

  

(iii) 3rd Fed Bank Dividend. TF Financial shall cause 3rd Fed Bank (A) to seek
approval as soon as practicable after the date hereof from the relevant
Regulatory Authority to dividend the maximum amount allowable under applicable
law or regulatory policy to TF Financial in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, and (B) to pay a dividend of such maximum amount to TF Financial
upon National Penn's written request at any time following 3rd Fed Bank's
receipt of the approval contemplated by clause (A) above and the satisfaction
of all of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 6.

implement an orderly, cost-effective consolidation of TF Financial's back room
operations presently located in Newtown, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, into
National Penn's operations in Allentown, Wyomissing, Reading, Bethlehem or

(c) Undertakings of National Penn.

  

  

(i) Employee Benefits.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 62 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(A) Subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as
of the Effective Time, National Penn shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of National Penn to assume and honor in
accordance with their terms all TF Financial Benefit Plans existing
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement which have been disclosed
in Section 3.12(a) of the TF Financial Disclosure Schedule. National Penn
acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a
"Change in Control" for purposes of the TF Financial Benefit Plans.

  

  

(B) Prior to the Effective Time, National Penn shall take all reasonable
action so that employees of TF Financial and its Subsidiaries who become
employees of National Penn or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing
Employees") shall be entitled to participate, effective as soon as
administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each National
Penn Benefit Plan of general applicability to the same extent as similarly-
situated employees of National Penn and its Subsidiaries (it being understood
that inclusion of the employees of TF Financial and its Subsidiaries in the
National Penn Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to
different plans and that any grants to any former employee of TF Financial or
its Subsidiaries under any equity compensation plan of National Penn shall be
discretionary with National Penn). To the extent that Continuing Employees are
not entitled to participate in any National Penn Benefit Plan effective as of
the Effective Time, such employees shall continue to participate in the
corresponding employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of TF Financial
and its Subsidiaries so as to ensure that there is not a lapse in
participation or coverage (but in no event to provide duplicate participation
or coverage), as applicable, prior to participation in such National Penn
Benefit Plan, provided that in no event shall National Penn be required to
continue any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of TF Financial for
which there is no corresponding National Penn Benefit Plan.

  

  

(C) As of the Effective Date, each Continuing Employee shall be entitled to
full credit for each year of service with TF Financial or the TF Financial
Subsidiary for purposes of determining eligibility for participation and
vesting, but not benefit accrual for periods of prior service, in National
Penn's, or as appropriate, in the National Penn Subsidiary's, employee benefit
plans, programs and policies; provided, however, that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. National
Penn shall use the original date of hire by TF Financial or a TF Financial
Subsidiary in making these determinations. As of the Effective Date, National
Penn and National Penn Bank shall assume the current accrual for all
Continuing Employees of all accrued but unused vacation time, paid time off
and personal days to the extent such amounts were accrued and payable in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice. Following the Effective
Date until December 31, 2014, each Continuing Employee shall accrue additional
vacation time, paid time off and personal days in the ordinary course and
consistent with past practice of TF Financial or a TF Financial Subsidiary. To
the extent any Continuing Employee is terminated between the Effective Date
and December 31, 2014, National Penn and National Penn Bank shall pay out all
accrued vacation time, paid time off and personal days in the same manner as
set forth in Section 5.12(e) hereof.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 63 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(D) The employee benefits provided to Continuing Employees after the Effective
Date shall be reasonably equivalent in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided by National Penn or its Subsidiaries to their similarly situated
employees. The medical, dental, disability and life insurance plans, programs
or policies, if any, that become applicable to Continuing Employees shall not
contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition
of any such employees or their dependents to the extent that such conditions
are covered under the applicable medical, dental, disability and life
insurance plans, programs or policies of TF Financial or the applicable TF
Financial Subsidiary. National Penn shall honor any co-payment, out-of-pocket
expenses and deductibles incurred by the Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries under a TF Financial health plan during the portion of the plan
year prior to participation in a National Penn plan for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such National
Penn health plans, upon substantiation in a form satisfactory to National Penn
that such co-payment and/or deductible has been satisfied. Further, National
Penn shall cause each plan to waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such
employee on or after the Effective Time, unless such employee had not yet
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous TF
Financial Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(E) Employees of TF Financial who are terminated on the Effective Date, or who
continue employment with National Penn and are terminated within one year of
the Effective Date, shall be entitled to severance equal to the greater amount
that would be awarded under the TF Financial severance policy in effect at the
Effective Date and disclosed on Section 3.12 of the TF Financial Disclosure
Schedule or the National Penn severance policy in effect at the time of
termination.

  

  

(F) As of the Effective Time, National Penn shall honor the terms of all
employment, consulting and change in control severance agreements, and all
deferred compensation agreements set forth in Section 5.14(c)(i)(F) of the TF
Financial Disclosure Schedule, subject to regulatory limitations, and shall
assume all obligations of TF Financial or 3rd Fed Bank thereunder.

  

  

(G) Nothing contained in this Section 5.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall confer upon any present or former employee of TF
Financial or a TF Financial Subsidiary any rights or remedies of any nature or
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or level of
compensation or benefits.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 64 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(H) Nothing contained in this Section 5.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall (i) limit the right of National Penn or any of its
affiliates to terminate the employment or services of, or to reassign or
otherwise alter the status of, any former employee of TF Financial or a TF
Financial Subsidiary after the Closing, (ii) limit the ability of National
Penn or any of its affiliates to terminate, amend or modify any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that National Penn or any
of its affiliates may assume, establish or maintain, including the TF
Financial Benefit Plans, or (iii) be construed as amending or modifying any TF
Financial Benefit Plan or National Penn Benefit Plan as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date.

  

  

(I) Nothing in this Section 5.14, or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall be
deemed to make any employee, former employee, director, former director, or
independent contractor of TF Financial, any TF Financial Subsidiary or any
Affiliate thereof (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement or provide any rights relating thereto.

  

  

(ii) Indemnification, Insurance.

  

  

(A) At and after the Effective Time, National Penn shall indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless the directors, officers, employees and agents of TF
Financial and the TF Financial Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party")
against all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), claims,
damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement arising out of actions
or omissions or alleged acts or omissions (collectively, "Prior Acts")
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Contemplated
Transactions) to the fullest extent permitted by federal and Pennsylvania law,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense
of any proceeding to the full extent permitted by federal and Pennsylvania law
upon receipt of any undertaking required by federal and Pennsylvania law.

  

  

(B) National Penn shall use its reasonable best efforts (and TF Financial
shall cooperate and assist prior to the Effective Date in these efforts), at
no expense to the beneficiaries, to:

  

  

(1) maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance")
for the Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, issued by a carrier assigned a claims-paying ability
rating by A.M. Best Company, Inc. of "A (Excellent)" or higher; or

  

  

(2) obtain coverage for Prior Acts for the Indemnified Parties under the
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies currently maintained by
National Penn; effective on the Effective Date, in either case, providing at
least the same coverage as the DandO Insurance currently maintained by TF
Financial and containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable to
the beneficiaries, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Date;
provided, that National Penn shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such six-year period in respect of the DandO Insurance which
exceed, for the portion related to TF Financial's directors and officers,
$150,000 (150% of the annual premium payment, as of June 1, 2014, under TF
Financial's current policy in effect on the date of this Agreement) (the
"Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, National Penn
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for a
premium equal to the Maximum Amount but in no event shall such insurance
policy cover a period of less than three years from the Effective Date.

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 65 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(C) If any claim is made against present or former directors, officers or
employees of TF Financial or any TF Financial Subsidiary who are covered or
potentially covered by insurance, neither National Penn Bank nor National Penn
shall do anything that would forfeit, jeopardize, restrict or limit the
insurance coverage available for that claim until the final disposition
thereof.

  

  

(D) If National Penn or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of National Penn
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.14(c)(ii).

  

  

(E) The provisions of this Section 5.14(c)(ii) are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives.

  

  

(F) National Penn shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.14(c)(ii).

  

  

(iii) Reorganization. Through the Closing Date, National Penn shall not take
any action that would preclude the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the IRC.

  

  

(iv) Conduct of National Penn's Business. Through the Closing Date, National
Penn shall use its reasonable good faith efforts to preserve its business
organization intact; maintain good relationships with employees, independent
contractors or consultants; and preserve the good will of customers of
National Penn and others with whom business relationships exist. In addition,
through the Closing Date, National Penn shall not, and National Penn shall not
permit any National Penn Subsidiary to take any action reasonably likely to
result in (a) National Penn's representations and warranties contained in
Article 4 hereto not being true in any material respect; or (b) any of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 hereto not being satisfied.
