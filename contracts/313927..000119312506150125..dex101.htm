It is hereby understood and agreed that all obligations or liabilities that

fact that such obligations or liabilities are obligations or liabilities of
the Acquired Subsidiaries (and not Seller) shall be, for the avoidance of
doubt, retained by such Acquired Subsidiaries, and Buyer shall cause such

respect of indebtedness for borrowed money (together with all accrued
interest, prepayment premiums or penalties related thereto), and under any
contract or instrument relating to or evidencing such indebtedness for

Price and the Assumed Liabilities unless required to do so by applicable law.
The parties shall exchange drafts of any information returns required by
Section 1060 of the Code and any similar state statute at least 60 days prior

the Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities shall be held at the

4(b)(iii)_ shall not have been satisfied by such date, on the date that is two
business days following satisfaction of such conditions. The date on
which the Closing shall occur is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing
Date_ ," and the Closing shall be deemed effective as of the time on the
Closing Date at which the Closing is actually consummated. On the business day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall conduct a pre-

time, at which each party shall present for review by the other party copies
in execution form of all documents required to be delivered by such party at

this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller (A) by wire transfer to a bank
account or bank accounts designated in writing by Seller immediately available

hereby, (D) certified copies of Buyers certificate of incorporation and

of State of Buyers jurisdiction of incorporation or organization as of a
date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) At the Closing, subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (A)
such appropriately executed instruments of sale, assignment, transfer and
conveyance in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and its
counsel evidencing and effecting the sale and transfer to Buyer of the Assets
(with it being understood, however, that such instruments shall not require
Seller or any other Person to make any additional representations, warranties
or covenants, express or implied, not contained in this Agreement), (B)
certified copies of resolutions duly adopted by Sellers board of directors
authorizing the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby, (C) certified copies of Sellers

Person" as defined in Code Section 1445\. With respect to the Intellectual
Property included in the Assets, such instruments to be delivered at the
Closing shall consist of assignments of such Intellectual Property in form
appropriate for recordation with governmental agencies or authorities
responsible for intellectual property, in particular, with respect to any
domain names included in the Assets, such instruments to be delivered at the
Closing shall consist of such documentation or instructions necessary to
initiate the process for transfer of the domain names through the applicable
registrar or registrars. It is being understood that the cost of preparing and
recording any such documents and any fees or Taxes associated with the
foregoing transfers shall be borne by Buyer.

(iii) As of the Closing Date there may be located on the Leased Real Property
certain Excluded Assets or certain Excluded Assets may be owned by or in the
possession of Sellers Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall agree on reasonable procedures to transfer such Excluded Assets to
Seller at such location or locations as shall be determined by Seller,
it being understood that the cost of transferring such Excluded Assets
(including any



 

10 applicable Taxes) shall be borne by Seller. After the Closing, Buyer shall
grant Seller and its representatives reasonable access to such Leased Real
Property, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, in order to
permit Seller and its representatives to remove such Excluded Assets and to
take such other necessary or appropriate action with respect thereto as
Seller may reasonably determine. In addition, after the Closing, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to, transfer any Excluded Assets to
Seller in a manner and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Seller. If at any time after the Closing Buyer discovers any Excluded Assets
located on the Leased Real Property or owned by or in the possession of Buyer
or a Subsidiary, it shall provide prompt written notice thereof to Seller. 

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(i) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a statement (in its final and binding form, the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth Closing Net Working Capital and Closing
Subsidiary Cash and the resulting final Purchase Price as calculated with
reference to such amounts and, if applicable under _Section 8(e)_, any other
components thereof (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "), which Closing Statement
shall be accompanied by a certificate of Buyer that it has complied with the
covenants set forth in _Section 3(b)(iv)_. The Closing Statement shall be
prepared on a consolidated basis for Seller and the Acquired Subsidiaries in
accordance with GAAP Consistently Applied (except as otherwise provided in the
definitions of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Subsidiary Cash).
During the 30 days immediately following Sellers receipt of the
Closing Statement and during the period of any dispute with respect to the
Closing Statement, (A) Buyer shall assist Seller and its representatives in
the review of the Closing Statement and provide Seller and its representatives
with full access during normal business hours to the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), facilities
and employees of Buyer for such purpose, and, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, make available its employees (including employees who are
knowledgeable with respect to the matters set forth in the Closing Statement
and employees who were involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement)
to provide explanations with respect to the Closing Statement and to assist
in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section 3(b)_ (including
any dispute relating to the Closing Statement), and (B) cooperate fully with
Seller and its representatives, including the provision on a timely basis of
all information necessary or useful in connection with the review of the
Closing Statement.

(ii) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties 30
days following Sellers receipt thereof unless Seller gives written notice of
its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date.
Any Notice of Disagreement shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the nature
and amount of any disagreement so asserted, and (B) only include disagreements
based on mathematical errors or based on the Closing Statement not being
prepared in accordance with this _Section 3(b)_. If a timely Notice of
Disagreement is received by Buyer, then the Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the earlier of (x) the date the parties hereto resolve in
writing any and all differences they have with respect to any matter specified
in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date any matters properly in dispute
are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 30 days
immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which
they may have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of
Disagreement, and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise
agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. At the end of such 30-day
period, Seller and Buyer shall submit to a "big four" accounting firm for
review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters) which



 

11 remain in dispute and which were properly included in the Notice of
Disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to mutually agree upon an
accounting firm, Buyer and Seller shall select by lot a "big-four" accounting
firm (which shall exclude Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Sellers and Buyers
regular accounting firm). Buyer and Seller shall instruct the accounting firm
ultimately agreed upon or selected by lot under this _Section 3(b)_ (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") to, and the Accounting Firm shall, make a final
determination of the items included in the Closing Statement (to the extent
such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and procedures
set forth in this Agreement. Buyer and Seller will cooperate with the
Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. Buyer and Seller shall
instruct the Accounting Firm to not, and the Accounting Firm shall not, assign
a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or
Seller, on the other hand. Buyer and Seller shall also instruct the Accounting
Firm to, and the Accounting Firm shall, make its determination based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Seller which are in accordance with the guidelines
and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The Closing Statement and the resulting Final Purchase
Price shall become final and binding on Buyer and Seller on the date the
Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and Seller
(which final resolution shall be requested by the parties to be delivered not
more than 45 days following submission of such disputed matters). The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 3(b)_ shall be
borne by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the
ratio of the disputed amount not awarded to such party to the total
amount actually disputed by the parties. For example, if the aggregate amount
of the Final Purchase Price disputed by Seller is $1,000, and if Buyer
contests only $500 of the amount disputed by Seller, and if the Accounting
Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by finding that Seller properly disputed
$300 of the $500, then the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300÷500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200÷500) to Seller.

(iii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Buyer shall, and if the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final
Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five business days after the Closing
Statement becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment to the other
party by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of
such difference, together with interest thereon at 8% per annum (the "
_Applicable Rate_ "), calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed
from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Buyers obligation to pay
amounts under this _Section 3(b)(iii)_ shall not be subject to offset or
reduction by reason of any actual or alleged breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any agreement or document
delivered in connection herewith or any right or alleged right to
indemnification hereunder.

(iv) Buyer agrees that following the Closing it will not take any actions
with respect to its accounting books, records, policies and procedures that
would obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Closing Statement as provided
in this _Section 3(b)_.

(c) _Estimated Purchase Price_. No less than two (2) business days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of the
Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "), and a certificate signed
by Seller to the effect that Estimated Purchase Price was determined in good
faith in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3_;  _provided_ that,
solely for purposes of Closing mechanics (and without prejudice to the amount
of the Final Purchase Price as ultimately determined pursuant to this
Agreement), in no event shall the Estimated Purchase Price be greater
than $330,000,000 or less than $320,000,000.

respect to each Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) (a " _Pension Plan_ "), the
Seller has made available to Buyer, true and complete copies of (x) the most
recently filed annual report (Form 5500 and all schedules thereto) and (y)
the most recent actuarial report and financial statement.

(iii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5(u)_ , each Benefit Plan has been
maintained, operated and administered in compliance in all material respects
with its terms and all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each
Pension Plan meets the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the
Code and all related trusts are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code.



 

22 (iv) No Benefit Plan is now or at any time has been subject to Part 3,
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA and no Benefit Plan is
now or at any time has been a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA.

(v) No Benefit Plan provides benefits, including death or medical benefits,
beyond termination of service or retirement other than (A) coverage mandated
by law or (B) death or retirement benefits under a Benefit Plan qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither Seller nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates have made a written or oral representation to any Employee or
Former Employee promising or guaranteeing any employer paid continuation of
medical, dental, life or disability coverage for any period of time beyond
retirement or termination of employment.

(vi) No Asset (that is not an Excluded Asset) is subject to any lien under the
Code or ERISA and neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
liability which could subject Buyer or any Asset (other than an Excluded
Asset) to liability under Section 4062, 4063, 4064 or 4069 of ERISA.

(vii) No payment which is or may be made by, from or with respect to any
Benefit Plan which either alone or in conjunction with any other payment,
will or would be reasonably be expected to properly be characterized as an
excess "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

(viii) Except as listed in _Schedule 5(u)_ , there are no material pension
welfare, bonus, stock purchase, stock ownership, stock option, deferred
compensation, incentive, severance, termination or other compensation plan or
arrangement, or other material employee fringe benefit plan presently
maintained by, or contributed to by, Seller, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any Employee or Former Employee of Seller, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, including any such plan required to be
maintained or contributed to by the law of the relevant jurisdiction, which
would be described in  _Section 5(u)(i)_, but for the fact that such plans
are maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States (" _Foreign
Plans_ "). Seller has provided Buyer a true and complete summary of each
Foreign Plan. Each Foreign Plan has been maintained, operated and
administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms and all
applicable laws.

Information_ ") is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement dated
as of March 7, 2006 between or on behalf of Seller and Buyer or one or more of
their respective Affiliates or other beneficial owners (the " _Confidentiality

(i) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any other Person has
made any representation or warranty, express or implied, including any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any

otherwise regarding the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Seller

transactions contemplated hereby without reliance on, and hereby disclaims,
any representation or warranty, express or implied, by Seller or any other
Person except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement executed and delivered by Seller or as and to the extent expressly
required by this Agreement to be set forth in the Schedules hereto. Buyer
further agrees that neither Seller nor any other Person makes any

in certain "data rooms" and online "data sites", management presentations or
any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement. Buyer further acknowledges
and agrees that Buyer has been given access to the premises, properties,
books, contracts and records of Seller and has been furnished with all

connection with Buyers determination to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer further acknowledges
and agrees that it is sophisticated in all aspects of the general industry of
Seller and has sufficient knowledge and expertise to evaluate the purchase of
the Assets and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

(ii) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Business and the Assets,
Buyer may have received from or on behalf of Seller certain projections,
including projected statements of net revenues, direct product contribution
and operating income of Seller and certain business plan information. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer
is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections
and forecasts), and that Buyer shall have no claim against Seller or any

 



 

27 other Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, neither Seller nor any other
Person makes any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to any
such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts).

(iii) WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THIS _SECTION 8(b)_ , AND WITHOUT
LIMITATION OF BUYERS RECOURSE AS ELSEWHERE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT EXECUTED AND DELIVERED BY SELLER, BUYER
FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SELLER MAKES NO, AND BUYER HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS, EXPRESS

CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF
ANY OF THE ASSETS AND IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY

responsible for all other transition matters in respect of, and continuing
business relationships with, all customers and suppliers in connection with
the change in ownership of the Business, except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Transition Services Agreement.

(d) _Intellectual Property_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that during the twelve-month period
following the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
use the Intellectual Property described on _Schedule 8(d)_ in connection with
the Excluded Business and the Excluded Products.

(e) _Assumed Liabilities_. Although Seller does not intend (except as set
forth in this _Section 8(e)_) to pay any liabilities which are included in
the definition of "Assumed Liabilities" after 11:59 p.m. Chicago time on the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date, should it do so in cash or other
immediately available funds, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller by
certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds for the
amount of any such payments; _provided_ that, for purposes of administrative
convenience, Seller may elect to pay any portion or all of the Pre-Closing
Employee Expenses after the Closing and, should it elect to do so, in lieu
of such reimbursement as provided above, Seller may elect to treat the amount
of Pre-Closing Employee Expenses paid or to be paid by Seller as increasing
the Purchase Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis and, if so elected by Seller,
such amount shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
definition of Purchase Price, be taken into account in connection with the
determination of the Estimated Purchase Price and/or the Final Purchase Price
under this Agreement.



 

28 9\. _Mutual Covenants_. Seller and Buyer covenant and agree as follows:

(a) _Consents_.

(i) Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be required from parties to the Contracts or the
Purchase Orders and such consents have not been obtained and may not be

Buyer (and Buyer shall not be entitled to assert any claims against Seller)
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have
been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or termination of any
Contract or Purchase Order or loss of right under any Contract or Purchase
Order as a result thereof (provided that the foregoing shall not limit
Buyers right to assert a claim under _Article 10_ for a breach of the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Section 5(a)(ii)_, to
the extent applicable). Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty
or covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached
and, except as expressly provided in _Section 4(a)(ii)_ and _Section
4(a)(iv)_, no condition of Buyer shall be deemed not to be satisfied as
a result of (A) the failure to obtain any consent or as a result of any such
default, acceleration or termination or loss of right or (B) any lawsuit,
action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any Persons arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consent or any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of right. At
Buyers written request prior to the Closing, Seller shall cooperate with
Buyer in any reasonable manner in connection with Buyers obtaining any such
consents; _provided_ _that_ such cooperation shall not include any requirement
of Seller to commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

properly assigned to Buyer because of the failure to obtain a required
consent (" _Nontransferable Contracts_ ") or any consent that is not obtained,
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any
obligation or liability that Seller may have under or in connection with such
Nontransferable Contracts or arising out of the failure to obtain such consent
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened
by or on behalf of any Persons arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any consent or any default, acceleration or termination or loss of
right under any such Nontransferable Contracts (provided that the foregoing
shall not limit Buyers right to assert a claim under _Article 10_ for a
breach of the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Section
5(a)(ii)_, to the extent applicable).

 

(iii) With respect to any Nontransferable Contract with respect to which Buyer
has requested Sellers cooperation in accordance with _Section 9(a)(i)_ and
with respect to which Seller and Buyer are unable to obtain a consent from the
other party or parties, Buyer shall have the right to require Seller to use
reasonable efforts to attempt to perform any such Nontransferable Contract,
to the extent it relates to the Business, as agent for and for the account of
Buyer, for a period up to 90 days following the Closing Date; _provided_ that
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all costs, expenses, losses and
liabilities incurred by Seller in connection with taking such action.

(iv) If Seller is unable to obtain (or if Seller reasonably believes it will
be unable to obtain) the consent described on _Schedule 4(a)(iv)_ and Buyer
has not waived the condition set forth in _Section 4(a)(iv)_, Seller and
Buyer will, at the request of Seller, negotiate in good faith the terms of,
and use commercially reasonable best efforts to enter into, an agreement (the
" _Alternative Agreement_ ") at or before Closing pursuant to which Seller
will engage Buyer to perform all of Sellers obligations under the Contract
set forth on _Schedule 4(a)(iv)_ from and after the Closing and Buyer will be
afforded all of Sellers rights and benefits under such Contract, and Buyer
will agree to perform (in such manner as is sufficient to enable Seller to
comply with its



 

29 obligations under such Contract) all of Sellers obligations under such
Contract from and after the Closing, throughout the term of such Contract
(or, if earlier, until such consent is obtained) and Seller will provide to
Buyer all of Sellers rights and benefits under such Contract; _provided_ that
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all costs, expenses, losses and
liabilities incurred by Seller in connection with any Alternative Agreement.

(b) _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof through
the Closing Date, except as required by law or applicable rules or regulations

announcement or statement, Buyer shall give written notice to Seller
describing in reasonable detail the proposed content thereof and shall permit
Seller to review and comment upon the form and substance of such release,
announcement or statement), no release, announcement or statement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf
of any party without the prior consent of the other party, except that Seller
may make announcements from time to time to its employees, customers,
suppliers and other business relations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release to be issued on the
Closing Date. Seller and Buyer agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential, except to the extent required by applicable law or any
applicable stock exchange or for financial reporting purposes and except that
the parties may disclose such terms to their respective accountants and other
representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their
respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound by
contract to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential). In addition, Buyer
shall not disclose the name or identity of any of the stockholders of Seller
(including in any release, announcement or statement or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of Seller, unless such disclosure is required by
applicable law, any applicable stock exchange or governmental regulations or
by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, in which case, prior to making

reasonable detail the proposed content of such disclosure and shall permit
Seller and the applicable stockholders of Seller to review and comment upon
the form and substance of such disclosure.

Agreement (including the limitations set forth in _Section 9(a)_ and this
_Section 9(c)_), each party shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause the conditions to Closing of the other party to be
satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or the provisions
of _Section 9(d)_, for purposes of this _Section 9(c)_ and _Section 9(d)_,
the "commercially reasonable best efforts" of Buyer shall include Buyers
agreement to hold separate and divest or license such portion of the Business
or such products and assets of Buyer or its Affiliates as may be necessary to
obtain the agreement of any governmental agency or authority not to seek an
injunction against or otherwise oppose the transactions contemplated hereby,
on such terms as may be required by such governmental agency or authority, and
to cooperate with Seller in connection with Sellers obtaining of the consent
set forth in _Section 4(a)(iv)_ and the satisfaction of such condition to
Closing. The "commercially reasonable best efforts" of Seller under this
Agreement shall not include any requirement of Seller to commence any
litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party.

to be filed, promptly (but in any event on or prior to July 17, 2006) after
the date of this Agreement, any notifications or the like required to be filed
under the HSR Act and other antitrust or competition laws of any applicable
jurisdiction with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and
Seller shall bear the costs and expenses of their respective filings, but
Buyer shall pay all filing fees in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller
shall (subject to Sellers rights under _Section 11(a)_) use their respective
commercially reasonable best efforts to respond to any requests for additional
information made by any agencies and to cause the waiting periods or other
requirements under the HSR Act and all other applicable antitrust or
competition laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date
(including with



 

30 respect to filings under the HSR Act, seeking early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act) and, subject to Sellers rights under _Section
11(a)_, to resist in good faith (including the institution or defense of legal
proceedings), any assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby
constitute a violation of the antitrust or competition laws of any applicable
jurisdiction, all to the end of expediting consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and Seller shall (A) unless otherwise
prohibited by applicable law, promptly notify each other of any communication
to that party from the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ "), the United States
Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other regulatory agency with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and permit the other party to review

regulatory agency; (B) unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, furnish
the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and other
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it,
its Affiliates and their respective representatives, on the one hand, and the
FTC, the DOJ or any other regulatory agency, or members of their
respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications which are subject
to pre-existing confidentiality agreements or to attorney-client privilege);
and (C) consult with the other prior to any meetings, by telephone or in

information relating to, or which may be applicable to or used in connection
with, the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities, the Excluded
Business and the Excluded Products, and that Seller may retain copies of such
books and records and other materials, including any consumer, customer,
manufacturer and vendor lists and market research to the extent relating to,
or which may be applicable to or used in connection with, the Excluded
Business (whether or not the same also constitutes Assets), and Seller and its
Affiliates and stockholders may use the same solely in connection with the
Excluded Business.

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, to any books and records and other
financial data included in the Assets (A) relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date in connection with the preparation of tax returns (and
any materials necessary for the preparation of the United States federal and
state income tax returns of the stockholders of Seller) and financial
statements for periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the management
and handling of Tax audits and the management and handling of the matters set
forth in _Section 3(b)_ or any litigation or other proceeding in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether such litigation or other
proceeding is a matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought
hereunder, or, to the extent reasonably requested, such other similar
purposes, or (B) relating to the Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities,
the



 

31 Excluded Business or the Excluded Products. In addition, from and after the
Closing, Buyer shall, upon written request, make reasonably available to
Seller and cause its employees who are Transferred Employees to assist in the
preparation of tax returns for periods prior to the Closing (and any materials
necessary for the preparation of the United States federal and state income
tax returns of Seller) and the management and handling of Tax audits and the
management and handling of the matters set forth in _Section 3(b)_ or any
litigation or other proceeding in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether such litigation or other proceeding is a matter
with respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder (including by
making such employees available to Seller for interviews and factual
investigations and appearing at Sellers request to give testimony without
requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process). Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), Buyer shall not, for a period of five years following the Closing
Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any material books and records of
the Business, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date without first offering to surrender to Seller such books and
records or such portions thereof. The parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by each party and at the requesting partys
expense, in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(g) _Employees_.

(i) _Schedule 9(g)(i)_ identifies all Employees as of the date of this
Agreement by name, location and title or function, and Seller has previously
made available to Buyer a list identifying the current base salary or hourly
wage, bonus opportunity, date of hire and accrued paid time-off for such
Employees.  _Schedule 9(g)(iii)_ identifies all Seller stockholder-related
Employees. Seller shall make available to Buyer an updated _Schedule 9(g)(i)_
and list containing such information as of five (5) days prior to
Closing. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer or one of its Affiliates
shall extend offers of employment to all of the Employees on the updated
_Schedule 9(g)(i)_ but not to Employees identified on _Schedule 9(g)(iii)_.
Such offers of employment shall be at an aggregate salary or hourly wage and
bonus opportunity that is substantially equivalent to the salary or hourly
wage and bonus opportunity indicated on the updated list made available by
Seller and shall provide for substantially similar in the aggregate employee
benefits as those provided either by Seller immediately before the Closing
(but disregarding for this purposes the Retained Benefit Plans) or to
similarly situated employees of the Buyer or its Affiliate. All Employees who
accept such offer of employment are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Transferred Employees_."

(ii) Seller shall retain responsibility for all payments, benefits or other
obligations owed to any Employee or Former Employee (whether or not such
individual becomes a Transferred Employee) under any Benefit Plan identified
on _Schedule 9(g)(ii)_ (the " _Retained Benefit Plans_ ").

(iii) With respect to each Transferred Employee:

(A) Buyer shall waive pre-existing condition requirements, evidence of
insurability provisions, waiting period requirements or any similar
provisions under any employee benefit plan or compensation arrangements
maintained or sponsored by or contributed to by Buyer for such Transferred
Employees after the Closing Date.



 

32 (B) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to have any
applicable insurance company apply toward any deductible requirements and
out-of-pocket maximum limits under its employee welfare benefit plans any
deductibles or co-insurance paid by each Transferred Employee under Sellers
welfare benefit plans during the current plan year.

(C) With respect to its employee benefit plans, programs and policies, Buyer
shall recognize for purposes of participation, eligibility and vesting (but
not for purposes of benefit accrual) the service of any Transferred Employee
with Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date.

(D) Buyer shall be responsible for all workers compensation benefits payable
to Transferred Employees with respect to injuries to Transferred Employees
before, on or after the Closing Date.

(E) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against
any Losses (as defined in _Section 10(a)_) for severance liability suffered
by Seller with respect to any Transferred Employee (other than severance
obligations of Seller under Sellers 2006 Executive Compensation
Program, 2006 Stay Bonus and Severance Plan, and 2006 Stay Bonus and
Severance Policy).

(F) Buyer and Seller agree to comply with the alternate procedure under
Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53.

(G) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred
Employee any right with respect to continued employment by Buyer or its
Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of Buyer or its
Affiliates, following any employment of any Transferred Employee,
to terminate the employment of any such Transferred Employee at any time,
with or without cause, or restrict Buyer or its Affiliates in the exercise of
their independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms and
conditions of the employment (including the terms of any benefit plan) of any
such Transferred Employee.

(iv) Buyer shall indemnify and defend Seller and hold it harmless from and
against any Losses which may be incurred or suffered by Seller under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq.,
or any similar state law arising out of, or relating to, any actions taken by
Buyer on or after the Closing Date.

(v) Buyer shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage pursuant
to Section 4980B and the regulations thereunder to Transferred Employees, each
such other "MandA qualified beneficiary" (as such term is defined under Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9). Buyer and Seller agree that the Sellers
stockholder-related Employees listed on _Schedule 9(g)(iii)_ shall be
terminated by Seller in conjunction with the Closing and, to the extent that
such Employees and their covered spouses and dependents are covered under
Sellers medical or dental plans as of the Closing Date, such individuals
shall be deemed "MandA qualified beneficiaries" for purposes of this paragraph.

(vi) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall make available a defined
contribution retirement plan qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of
the Code for the benefit of all Transferred Employees (" _Buyer s 401(k)
Plan_"). Buyers 401(k) Plan shall permit the "rollover" by Transferred
Employees of their existing account balance in the Orange Glo International
401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, including plan loans, as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date.



 

33 (vii) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume responsibility for
all accrued paid time-off of Transferred Employees and such paid time-off
shall be made available by Buyer to each such Transferred Employee or, if such
Transferred Employee terminates prior to receipt of such paid time-off, an
amount equal to any remaining balance shall be paid by Buyer to such
Transferred Employee.

(viii) Unless, not less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer provides written notice to the Seller to the contrary, the Seller
shall cause its board of directors to adopt a board consent immediately prior
to the Closing to terminate the Sellers 401(k) plan (" _401(k) Plan_ ") and
fully vest all affected participants effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

(h)  _Accounts Receivable_. Seller shall promptly forward or cause to be
forwarded to Buyer any and all proceeds from accounts receivable relating to
the Business that are received by Seller or its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to
Seller any and all proceeds from accounts receivable relating to the Excluded
Business that are received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date. If either Buyer or Seller receives proceeds from a customer in
respect of an account receivable that relates to both the Business and the
Excluded Business and the customer does not specify whether the payment
relates to the Business or the Excluded Business, such proceeds shall be
prorated between Buyer and Seller based upon the sales relating to the
Business and the sales relating to the Excluded Business reflected by such
account receivable. If any customer deducts any amount in respect of an
account receivable that relates to both the Business and the Excluded
Business and the customer does not specify whether the deduction relates to
the Business or the Excluded Business, any amounts deducted by such customer
shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller based upon the sales relating to
the Business and the sales relating to the Excluded Business reflected by such
account receivable.

(i)  _Ancillary Agreements_. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller
and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith a Transition Services Agreement, which
shall be executed and delivered at Closing, pursuant to which Buyer shall
provide such post-closing transitional services to Seller and Sellers
Affiliates (including, for this purpose, any of its stockholders) as
contemplated hereby for a period not to exceed 120 days following the Closing.
These services shall include (i) use by Sellers stockholders of their
current offices at the Leased Real Property (at no cost), (ii) reasonable
support and administrative staff services, (iii) reasonable access to other
Transferred Employees for such transition and related services as Seller or
its Affiliates (including, for this purpose, any of its stockholders) may
reasonably request (with such services to be requested pursuant to this clause
(iii) not expected to exceed an aggregate of 15 hours per week on average
during the term of the Transition Services Agreement), (iv) consumer services
and call center support in respect of the Excluded Business and (v) such other
services as Seller may reasonably request prior to the Closing. The cost for
these services shall be determined prior to the Closing and shall be set forth
in the Transitional Services Agreement, but shall not exceed Buyers actual
out-of-pocket cost (except that the office space referred to above shall be
provided at no cost). The services to be provided under the Transition
Services Agreement are in addition to (and not in lieu of) those services
contemplated in _Section 9(f)_. At the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
execute and deliver the Noncompetition Agreement and the Transition Services
Agreement.

(j) _Transaction Structure_. In the event that (i) the consent set forth in
_Schedule 4(a)(iv)_ is not reasonably expected to be obtained (and in any
event if such consent has not been obtained within five (5) business days
prior to the scheduled Closing Date set forth in  _Section 3(a)_) and Buyer
has



 

34 not waived the condition set forth in _Section 4(a)(iv)_ and (ii) Seller and
Buyer are not able to reach an agreement on the terms of the Alternative
Agreement despite the use of commercially reasonable best efforts and good
faith in the negotiation thereof as required by _Section 9(a)(iv)_, Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller, at Sellers request, to amend and modify this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby, in such manner as
reasonably requested by Seller to implement an alternative structure for the
transfer of the Business to Buyer from that contemplated in this Agreement
provided such amended Agreement shall contain the provisions (" _Required
Provisions_ ") set forth below in form reasonably satisfactory to Seller (or
Alternative Seller, as defined below) and Buyer. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the alternative structure may take the form
of (1) a sale of stock of Seller by the stockholders of Seller (the "
_338(h)(10) Alternative_ "), (2) a sale of stock of Seller (which, under
this alternative, would elect to be treated as a qualified subchapter S
subsidiary within the meaning of Code Section 1361 prior to the Closing Date)
by a new entity (" _Alternative Seller_ ") treated as an S corporation for
federal income tax purposes and formed for the purpose of holding the capital
stock of Seller (the " _QSSS Alternative_ "), or (3) a sale of the equity
interests of a limited liability company (the " _Successor_ ") that is
a successor (by merger or conversion) of Seller that does not elect to be
treated as a corporation for federal income Tax purposes (the " _Successor
Alternative_ "). The Required Provisions shall (A) provide for the purchase
and sale of the shares of capital stock of Seller (or equity interests in the
Successor, if applicable) in lieu of the Assets, (B) require the filing of an
election under Code Section 338(h)(10), and any corresponding election under
state, local, and foreign Tax law with respect to the purchase of the shares
of capital stock of Seller if the 338(h)(10) Alternative is selected, and (C)
provide for the transfer of any Excluded Assets to the Sellers assignee or
assignees and the assumption by the Alternative Seller of any Excluded
Liabilities. The alternative structure shall be selected by Buyer and shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Seller, provided that the parties hereto agree
the Successor Alternative shall be reasonably acceptable to Seller in the
event that no change in any Tax law that would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse impact on the Tax consequences to Seller or Alternative
Seller (or their respective stockholders or equityholders, as applicable) of
such alternative occurs on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 9(j)_, Buyer need not accept an
alternative structure unless such alternative structure delivers
substantially the same economic result (including asset step-up basis for tax
purposes) and would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer or its
Affiliates.

10\. _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the provisions of this _Section 10_), Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, and employees
(the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each of them harmless from any
out-of-pocket loss, liability, damage or expense (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) (" _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties to the extent resulting from (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Seller (excluding the
Noncompetition Agreement executed and delivered by Seller), (ii) any breach of
any covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
executed and delivered by Seller (excluding the Noncompetition Agreement
executed and delivered by Seller) or (iii) any Excluded Liability; _provided_
that Seller shall not have any liability under this _Section 10_ for any
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Seller or any covenant of Seller
contained in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Closing, and
no claims by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be so asserted, unless
and until the aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller would, but for this
proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
$4,875,000, and then only to the extent of any such excess; _provided_
_further_ that Seller shall not have any liability under this _Section 10_
for any breach of any representation or warranty contained in this



 

35 Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Seller or any
covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to
the Closing, and no claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be so
asserted, for any individual item where the Loss relating to such claim (or
series of related claims arising from the same or substantially similar facts
or circumstances) is less than $30,000, and such items shall be disregarded
for purposes of the first proviso to this _Section 10(a)_; and _provided_
_further_ that Sellers aggregate liability under this _Section 10(a)_ for
any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Seller or any covenant of Seller
contained in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Closing, shall
in no event exceed $32,500,000. Buyer agrees that in the event of any breach
giving rise to an indemnification obligation of Seller hereunder, Buyer shall
take and cause its Affiliates to take, or cooperate with Seller, if
so requested by Seller, in order to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate
the consequences of the related breach. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, claims for (i) any breach of any
covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
executed and delivered by Seller to be performed after the Closing, (ii) any
Excluded Liability, or (iii) with respect to _Section 5(a)(i)_ (Organization
and Authority; No Conflicts), _Section 5(a)(ii)_ (Organization and
Authority; No Conflicts) (but solely for the matters set forth therein with
respect to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Seller) and _Section
12(l)_ (Brokerage) of this Agreement shall not be subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section 10(a)_. For purposes of determining the existence
of a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder (except with respect to
_Section 5(d)_ (Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities), the first
two (2) sentences of _Section 5(h)_ (Contracts), _Section 5(j)_ (Material
Adverse Effect) and _Section 5(r)_ (Customers; Suppliers)) or calculating
the amount of Losses resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty
hereunder (except with respect to _Section 5(d)_ (Financial Statements;
Undisclosed Liabilities), the first two (2) sentences of _Section
5(h)_ (Contracts), _Section 5(j)_ (Material Adverse Effect) and _Section
5(r)_ (Customers; Suppliers)), references to "Material Adverse Effect" or
"material" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative terms), shall
be disregarded (but with it being understood that, for purposes of determining
whether a breach of a representation or warranty constitutes an intentional
fraudulent misrepresentation, such references to "Material Adverse Effect" or
"material" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative terms) shall
not be disregarded).

(b)  _Exclusive Remedy_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after
the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages with respect
to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (excluding the Noncompetition Agreements), and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (excluding the Noncompetition
Agreements), shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this _Section 10_ and the provisions of the Stockholder Indemnification
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against Seller, whether known or unknown and whether accrued or unaccrued,
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise, except for intentional fraudulent
misrepresentation relating to a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall have no right to indemnification
under  _Section 10(a)_ with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss if Buyer
shall have requested a reduction in the Closing Net Working Capital reflected
on the Closing Statement on account of any matter forming the basis for such
Loss or alleged Loss and shall have agreed, or the Accounting Firm shall have
determined, that no such reduction (or any portion thereof) is appropriate.

(c) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, and employees
(the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each of them harmless from
any Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties to
the extent resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement executed and
delivered by Buyer, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement executed and delivered by Buyer,
(iii)



 

36 any failure of Buyer to pay, discharge or perform, or otherwise comply with,
any of the Assumed Liabilities, (iv) any guarantee or obligation to assure
performance given or made by Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to
any of the Assumed Liabilities, and (v) any and all obligations, liabilities,
actions, suits, claims and other proceedings which arise directly or
indirectly out of the operation of the Business or use of the Assets after the
Closing.

(d) _Certain Additional Matters_.

(i) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Section 10_ shall be
determined net of (A) the net present value of any Tax benefits reasonably
expected to be realized (calculated using a discount rate equal to the
Applicable Rate) by any party seeking indemnification hereunder arising from
the deductibility of any such Losses, (B) any amounts recovered, recoverable
or for which there is a right of recovery by the indemnified party under or
pursuant to any insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or
contract with respect to such Losses or pursuant to or under which such
indemnified party or its Affiliates has rights (collectively, " _Alternative
Arrangements_ "), and (C) any liability or reserve reflected in the Financial
Statements or the Closing Statement with respect to any matter forming the
basis for such Losses. In the event of a claim covered by both an Alternative
Arrangement and the indemnification provisions of this _Article 10_ (a "
_Dual Covered Claim_ "), Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable best
efforts to seek and pursue recovery under such Alternative Arrangement prior
to any Buyer Indemnified Party making a claim for indemnification under this
_Article 10_. In the event that, with respect to any such Dual Covered
Claim, the Buyer has used commercially reasonable best efforts to seek and
pursue recovery under such Alternative Arrangement but has failed to recover
the full amount of such claim within thirty (30) business days prior to the
applicable Termination Date for such claim under _Section 10(e)_, then the
Buyer may make a claim for indemnification under this _Article 10_;
_provided_ that the Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable best
efforts to continue to seek and pursue recovery under such Alternative
Arrangement contemporaneously with seeking indemnification under this _Article
10_. Seller shall have no liability, and Buyer shall have no right to assert
any claims, with respect to any Losses that would have been covered by any
Alternative Arrangement in any Contract or Purchase Order had Buyer not
amended or waived the terms of such Contract or Purchase Order as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. 

(ii) Except those damages payable to third parties (other than Buyer or the
other Buyer Indemnified Parties), in no event shall the Buyer Indemnified
Parties be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of,
and in no event shall Losses be deemed to include, consequential, incidental
or indirect damages, lost profits or punitive, special or exemplary damages
and, in particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or
similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any
Losses. Except those damages payable to third parties (other than Seller or
the other Seller Indemnified Parties), in no event shall the Seller
Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in
respect of, and in no event shall Losses be deemed to include,
consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits or punitive,
special or exemplary damages and, in particular, no "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in
calculating the amount of any Losses.

(iii) Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable Losses hereunder.



 

37 (iv) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

(e) _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or warranty
or covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 12(d)_; _provided_ _that_ such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless with respect to Losses arising
prior to expiration of the applicable period shall not terminate with respect
to any item as to which the party to be indemnified shall have, prior to the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and
legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of
this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) to the
indemnifying party. Seller shall have no liabilities or obligations under this
Agreement, and Buyer shall have no right to assert any claims, with respect to
any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent it is a Loss, cause of
action or claim with respect to which Buyer has taken action (or caused action
to be taken) to intentionally or knowingly accelerate the time period in which
such matter is asserted or payable.

(f) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

(i) In order for a party (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party (the "
_indemnifying party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third
Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such
indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim (stating in reasonable
detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such
claim for indemnification is made); _provided_ _that_ failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within 10 days after the indemnified
partys receipt thereof, copies of all written notices, correspondence and
documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating
to the Third Party Claim.

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party,
so long as (A) the indemnifying party provides the indemnified party with
notice in writing, within 30 days after receipt by indemnifying party of
notice of the Third Party Claim, that the indemnifying party is assuming the
defense, (B) the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages, and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, and (C) the claim for
indemnification does not relate to or arise in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation with respect to
the indemnified party; _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if it is reasonably more
likely than not that the Losses relating to such Third Party Claim to be paid
by the indemnified party (taking into account the dollar limitations otherwise
set forth in this _Article 10_) would exceed the amount of Losses relating to
such Third Party Claim to be paid by the indemnifying party (taking into
account the dollar limitations otherwise set forth in this _Article 10_).
Upon petition by the indemnified party, if the appropriate court rules that
the indemnifying party failed or is failing to diligently prosecute or defend
such claim, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to conduct the
defense of such claim. Should the indemnifying party elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the



 

38 indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal
expenses incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend any
Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the
indemnifying party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not Seller shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
admit any liability with respect to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without Sellers prior
written consent. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall admit any
liability with respect to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle,
compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim against Buyer without Buyers
prior written consent if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement,
injunctive or equitable relief will be imposed against Buyer.

11\. _Termination_.

(a) _Termination_. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(i) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(ii) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by Seller of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has prevented
the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer at the Closing
and such breach has not been waived by Buyer, or cured by Seller within twenty
days after written notice thereof from Buyer;

(iii) by Seller, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has prevented
the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Seller at the Closing
and such breach has not been waived by Seller, or cured by Buyer within twenty
days after written notice thereof from Seller ( _provided_   _that_ neither a
breach by Buyer of _Section 7(c)_ nor the failure by Buyer to deliver the
Estimated Purchase Price at the Closing as required hereunder shall be subject
to cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller);

(iv) by Seller at its sole discretion if (A) any governmental agency or body
or third party shall institute any suit or action challenging the validity or
legality, or seeking to restrain the consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) either (x) Seller reasonably believes
that such suit or action is reasonably likely to delay the Closing until or
after the Closing Deadline or (y) Buyer fails to use commercially reasonable
best efforts to defend such suit or action so as to prevent the entry of an
injunction or court order which could restrain or prohibit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(v) by Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been
consummated prior to November 11, 2006 (the " _Closing Deadline_ ");
_provided_ _that_ (A) Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (v) if Buyers knowing or



 

39 willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the failure to deliver the
Estimated Purchase Price) and (B) Seller shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this clause (v) if Sellers knowing or willful
breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) _Return of Documents and Confidential Information_. In the event
of termination by Seller or Buyer pursuant to this _Section 11_, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are terminated as provided herein, (i) Buyer shall return all
documents and copies and other materials received from or on behalf of Seller
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before
or after the execution hereof, to Seller, and (ii) all Confidential
Information shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination
of this Agreement.

(c) _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this Agreement
by Buyer or Seller as provided above, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and of no further force and effect (except for the provisions of _Section
8(a)_ (Confidentiality), _Section 9(b)_ (Publicity), _Section 12(e)_
(Expenses),  _Section 12(l)_ (Brokerage), _Section 12(p)_ (Governing Law),

on the part of Buyer or Seller to any other party hereto, except as set forth
in this _Section 11(c)_, except for any knowing and willful breaches of this
Agreement prior to the time of such termination and, in the case of Buyer,
except for the failure by Buyer to obtain sufficient financing for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or to deliver to Seller
the Estimated Purchase Price. Nothing in this _Section 11_ shall be deemed to
impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by another party
of its obligations under this Agreement.

12\. _Miscellaneous_. 

(a) _Assignment_. Except as set forth below, this Agreement and any rights and
obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer
(including by operation of law in connection with a merger or sale of stock,
or sale of substantially all the assets, of Buyer or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of Seller and any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void and without effect; _provided_ _that_ , without
the consent of Seller, Buyer shall be permitted to make a collateral
assignment of its rights under this Agreement to any of its lenders upon
written notice of such assignment to Seller and Buyer may assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Buyer
upon written notice of such assignment to Seller (it being understood,
however, that no such assignment shall limit or otherwise affect Buyers
obligations hereunder and that no such assignment shall materially impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein express or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder.

(c) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto, any other party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take,
or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to any
limitations set forth in this Agreement), as such other party may reasonably
deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party shall reimburse the other party for reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred pursuant to this _Section 12(c)_.



 

40 (d) _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the parties in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Noncompetition
Agreements and the Stockholder Indemnification Agreement) shall survive the
Closing solely for purposes of _Section 10(a)_ and _Section 10(c)_ and shall
terminate nine months after the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ however that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 5(a)(i)_ (Organization and Authority; No Conflicts) and _Section
5(a)(ii)_ (Organization and Authority; No Conflicts) (but solely for the
matters set forth therein with respect to the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of Seller) shall survive indefinitely. The covenants of Seller set
forth in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Closing shall
survive the Closing solely for purposes of _Section 10(a)_ and shall
terminate on the Termination Date and the covenants of Seller set forth in
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to be performed after the Closing
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms.

(e) _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs or expenses.

(f) _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended or any provision of
this Agreement may be waived; _provided_ that, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any amendment or waiver shall be binding only if
such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by the party
against whom enforcement is sought. No course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing

been drafted or prepared by one of the parties, the parties hereto confirm
that they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted
this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the parties, and
the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen
by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person.



 

42 (j) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by means of telecopied or electronically transmitted signature
pages), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall
become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.

(k) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the entire agreement
and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether
written or oral, relating to such subject matter. 

(l) _Brokerage_. Buyer has not used a broker or finder in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and there are no claims for
brokerage commissions, finders fees or similar compensation in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on any arrangement
or agreement by or on behalf of Buyer, except pursuant to an arrangement with

(m) _Schedules_. All Schedules hereto or referred to herein are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. The section numbers in these Schedules correspond to the section
numbers in the Agreement, provided, however, that the information and
disclosures contained in any section of these Schedules will be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other section(s) of these
Schedules as though fully set forth in such other section(s) for which the
applicability of such information or disclosure is reasonably apparent on its
face. The inclusion of information in the Schedules shall not be construed as
an admission that such information is material to the Assets, the Business or
Seller. In addition, matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the
Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Neither
the specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in the Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply that such
item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no party shall use the fact of setting forth or the
inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Schedules is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the
right to supplement, modify or update the Schedules in writing to reflect
changes and developments arising after the date hereof; _provided_ that any
such supplements, modifications or updates shall be delivered to Buyer at
least one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date (except for any changes
or developments which arise after the business day prior to the Closing Date,
which may be delivered to Buyer on the Closing Date). Any such supplements,
modifications or updates shall be subject to Buyers rights under _Section
4(a)(i)_ and shall have the effect of modifying the representations and
warranties made by Seller herein from and after the Closing for purposes of
the provisions of _Section 10_ above. From and after the Closing, references
to the Schedules shall be references to the Schedules as so supplemented,
modified and/or updated.



 

43 (n) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

(o) _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the
provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Assets.

(p) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without
regard to the conflicts of law principles of such State.

(q) _Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Litigation_.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 3(b)_, in the event of any
dispute or disagreement between Seller and Buyer as to the interpretation of
any provision of this Agreement (or the performance of obligations hereunder),
the matter, upon written request of either party, shall be referred to
representatives of the parties for decision. The representatives
shall promptly meet in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 3(b)_, if the representatives do not agree
upon a decision within 30 calendar days after reference of the matter to them,
any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to
this Agreement or the transactions arising hereunder shall be settled
exclusively by arbitration as provided in _Section 12(q)(ii)_ below, except
that if the amount in controversy or dispute or the amount of the claim
exceeds $2.5 million, or in the event that the matter involves a claim for
injunctive or other equitable relief, then either party may elect for such
controversy, dispute or claim to be heard and determined in court as provided
in _Section 12(q)(iii)_ below.

(ii) Any arbitration pursuant to this  _Section 12(q)_ shall be conducted in
the City of Chicago, Illinois. Such arbitration shall be administered by the
Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolutions (the "
_Institute_ ") in accordance with its then prevailing Rules for Non-
Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes (except as otherwise provided
herein), by one independent and impartial arbitrator selected in accordance
with such Rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in 
_Section 12(p)_ hereof, the arbitration shall be governed by the United
States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 _et_ _seq_. The fees and expenses of the
Institute and the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties and
advanced by them from time to time as required. No pre-arbitration discovery
shall be permitted, except that the arbitrator shall have the power in his
sole discretion, on application by -either party, to order pre-arbitration
examination of the witnesses and documents that the other party intends to
introduce in its case-in-chief at the arbitration hearing. Buyer and Seller
shall instruct the arbitrator to render his award within 30 days following the
conclusion of the arbitration hearing. The arbitrator shall not be empowered
to award to any party any damages of the type not permitted to be recovered
under this Agreement in connection with any dispute between the parties
arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or the transactions
arising hereunder, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to
recover such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in
this _Section 12(q)_ and without prejudice to the above procedures,
either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for temporary
injunctive or other provisional judicial relief if such action is necessary to
avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo. The award rendered by
the arbitrator shall be final and not subject to judicial review and judgment
thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.



 

44 (iii) Each of the parties submits to the jurisdiction of any federal court
sitting in the City of Chicago, Illinois, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that, subject to this _Section
12(q)_, all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court. Each party also agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court,
except to the extent seeking injunctive or other equitable judicial relief if
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the
status quo. Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought. Any party may make
service on any other party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to
the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 12(g)_ above. Nothing in this _Section 12(q)_,
however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law or at equity.

(r) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF

OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS

OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES
