-iv-        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of November 19, 2001 by
and among MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. ("BUYER"), a Delaware corporation; MAVERICK
MERGER SUB, INC. ("SUB"), a Delaware corporation; and DAL-TILE INTERNATIONAL
INC. ("TARGET"), a Delaware corporation.   PREAMBLE   The respective
Boards of Directors of Target, Sub and Buyer are of the opinion that the
transactions described herein are advisable and in the best interests of the
parties to this Agreement and their respective stockholders. This Agreement
provides for the acquisition of Target by Buyer pursuant to the merger of
Target with and into Sub. At the effective time of such merger,
the outstanding shares of the capital stock of Target shall be converted into
the right to receive a cash payment from Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
and shares of the common stock of Buyer (except as provided herein). As a
result, Sub shall continue to conduct the business and operations of Target
as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The transactions described in this
Agreement are subject to the approvals of the stockholders of Target, the
stockholders of Buyer, expiration of the required waiting period under the
HSR Act, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this
Agreement. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the
Merger for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
a condition and inducement to Buyer\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain of the holders of the outstanding shares of Target Common
Stock have executed and delivered to Buyer an agreement in substantially the
form of Exhibit 1 (the "TARGET VOTING AGREEMENTS"), pursuant to which they
have agreed, among other things, subject to the terms of such Target Voting
Agreement, to vote the shares of Target Common Stock over which such Persons
have voting power to approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger.   Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
a condition and inducement to Target\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, a stockholder of Buyer has executed and delivered to Target an
agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit 2 (the "BUYER VOTING
AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which such stockholder has agreed, among other
things, subject to the terms of such Buyer Voting Agreement, to vote the
shares of Buyer Common Stock over which such stockholder has voting power to
approve the issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger.   Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Section 11.1 of this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
above and the mutual warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements
set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:     ARTICLE 1
TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER  1.1 MERGER.   Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and subject to the provisions of Section 1.4 of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Target shall be merged with and into
Sub in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("DGCL") and with the effect provided therein (collectively
with the Reverse Merger, the "MERGER"). Sub shall be the
Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall remain a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Buyer and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the respective
Boards of Directors of Target, Sub and Buyer and by Buyer, as the sole
stockholder of Sub.  1.2 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING.   The closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "CLOSING") will take place at 9:00 A.M.
on the date that the Effective Time occurs (or the immediately preceding day
if the Effective Time is earlier than 9:00 A.M.), or at such other time as
the Parties, acting through their authorized officers, may mutually agree.
The Closing shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by
the Parties.  1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME.   The Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall become effective on the date and at the
time the Certificate of Merger reflecting the Merger shall become effective
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
Section 251 of the DGCL (the "EFFECTIVE TIME"). Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the
authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur on the first business day
following the last to occur of (i) the effective date (including expiration
of any applicable waiting period) of the last required Consent of any
Regulatory Authority having authority over and approving or exempting the
Merger, and (ii) the date or dates on which both the stockholders of Target
and the stockholders of Buyer have approved this Agreement.  1.4 RESTRUCTURE
OF TRANSACTION.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, at the close of trading on the NYSE on the day prior to the
scheduled Closing Date, the holders of the outstanding shares of Target
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, would not receive in
the Merger, in the aggregate, an amount of Buyer Common Stock with a value as
of the Effective Time equal to at least forty percent (40%) of the total
value of all shares of Target Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time taking into account the Cash Consideration paid or to be
paid to Target stockholders, then Target may elect by written notice to Buyer
prior to the Effective Time to have the Merger effected pursuant to a merger
of Sub with and into Target, with Target being the Surviving Corporation (the
"REVERSE MERGER"), the    -2-    conditions contained in Section 9.1(f)
will be deemed to have been waived by each Party, and any inaccuracy or
failure to perform the representations and covenants contained in Sections
5.17, 6.14 and 8.10 will be deemed to have been waived by each Party. The
Reverse Merger would not be intended to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The determination of the value of
Buyer Common Stock in the first sentence of this Section 1.4 shall be based
upon the Exchange Ratio and the closing sale price of a share of Buyer Common
Stock on the NYSE on the trading day prior to the Effective Time. "CASH
CONSIDERATION" shall be defined to mean cash or property other than Buyer
Common Stock in the Merger (including (i) the aggregate Cash Payments to be
paid to Target stockholders pursuant to Section 3.1(b), (ii) cash to be paid
to Target stockholders who perfect their dissenters\' rights (which for
purposes of this Agreement will be assumed to be an amount equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Target Common Stock for which
the Target stockholders have perfected their dissenters\' rights multiplied
by (B) the pro rata value of the Merger Consideration relating to such number
of shares calculated as of the date of this Agreement), (iii) redemptions
or acquisitions of Target Common Stock by Target or parties related to
Target (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-1(e)(3) without regard
to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) in connection with the Merger,
(iv) extraordinary distributions made by Target or parties related to Target
(within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-1(e)(3) without regard to
Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) prior to and in connection with the
Merger (other than those made pursuant to Target\'s historic dividend
practice), and (v) repurchases or acquisitions of Buyer Common Stock issued
in connection with the Merger by Buyer or certain parties related to Buyer
(within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-1(e)(3)). The Parties agree to
take all reasonable actions, including amending this Agreement and executing
any certificates, agreements or instruments necessary in order to effect the
intended purposes of this Section 1.4.   ARTICLE 2 TERMS OF MERGER  2.1
CHARTER.   The Certificate of Incorporation of Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until duly amended or repealed; provided that such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended to reflect a change of the name
of the Surviving Corporation.  2.2 BYLAWS.   The Bylaws of Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until duly amended or repealed.  2.3 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  
The directors of Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected,
shall serve as the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving   
-3-    Corporation. The officers of Sub in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be
elected, shall serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and
after the Effective Time in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE 3 MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES  3.1 CONVERSION OF
SHARES.   Subject to the provisions of this Article 3, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer,
Target, Sub or the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the
constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:   (a) Each share of
Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective
Time.   (b) Each share of Target Common Stock (excluding shares held by any
Target Entity or any Buyer Entity, and excluding shares held by stockholders
who perfect their statutory dissenters\' rights as provided in Section 3.4)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive from Buyer (i) a cash payment in the amount of $11.00 (less any
required withholding of Taxes, the "CASH PAYMENT") and (ii) (A) .2414 of a
share of Buyer Common Stock, if the Average Closing Price (as defined below)
is equal to or greater than $41.00 per share and less than or equal to $50.12
per share, or (B) that fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing $9.90 by the Average Closing Price, if the
Average Closing Price is less than $41.00 and greater than or equal to
$36.45, or (C) that fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing $12.10 by the Average Closing Price, if the
Average Closing Price is greater than $50.12 and less than or equal to
$54.67, or (D) .2716 of a share of Buyer Common Stock if the Average Closing
Price is less than $36.45 per share, or (E) .2213 of a share of Buyer Common
Stock if the Average Closing Price is greater than $54.67 (such applicable
fraction of Buyer Common Stock, the "EXCHANGE RATIO"). The Buyer Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, together with the Cash Payment and
cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.6 are
referred to collectively as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION." "AVERAGE CLOSING
PRICE" shall be defined to mean the average of the daily closing prices for
the shares of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty consecutive full trading days
on which such shares are actually traded on the NYSE (as reported by THE WALL
STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative
source selected by Buyer) ending at the close of the trading day three full
trading days prior to the Closing Date.  3.2 ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS.  
(a) In the event that Buyer changes the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to
such stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or
the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar
recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange    -4-    Ratios and the specified
Average Closing Prices identified in Section 3.1(b) shall all be
proportionately adjusted.   (b) In the event that, prior to the Effective
Time, Buyer shall consummate a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other
reorganization, or any other transaction with another Person pursuant to
which the holders of Buyer Common Stock receive or become entitled to receive
securities, cash or other assets or any combination thereof, each holder of
Target Common Stock shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time for
each share of Target Common Stock, the Cash Payment plus that amount of
securities, cash or other assets that such holder would have received or
become entitled to receive had such holder been the record holder of the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable to such holder of Target
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b) had the Effective Time occurred
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction.  3.3 SHARES HELD
BY TARGET OR BUYER.   Each of the shares of Target Common Stock held by any
Target Entity or by any Buyer Entity shall be canceled and retired at the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.  3.4 DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS.   Any holder of shares of Target
Common Stock who perfects such holder\'s dissenters\' rights in accordance
with and as contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive from the Surviving Corporation the value of such shares in cash as
determined pursuant to such provision of Law; provided, that no such payment
shall be made to any dissenting stockholder unless and until such dissenting
stockholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and
surrendered to Target the Certificate or Certificates (as defined below)
representing the shares for which payment is being made. In the event that
after the Effective Time a dissenting stockholder of Target fails to perfect,
or effectively withdraws or loses, such holder\'s right to appraisal of and
payment for such holder\'s shares, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of shares of
Target Common Stock is entitled under this Article 3 (without interest) upon
surrender by such holder of the Certificate or Certificates representing the
shares of Target Common Stock held by such holder.  3.5 CONVERSION OF STOCK
OPTIONS.   (a) To the extent that a particular holder of Target Options
consents in writing to the conversion of all and not less than all of his or
her Target Options pursuant to this Section 3.5(a), and provided that
such written consent is delivered to Target within two business days prior to
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, such holder\'s Target Options
shall be converted, at the Effective Time, as follows:   (i) One-half of
the Target Options held by each particular holder  which are outstanding at
the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable  (each a "CASHOUT
OPTION"),    -5-     shall be canceled, and such holder shall be
entitled to receive from  Buyer for each such Cashout Option (subject to any
applicable withholding  tax) cash equal to the amount by which (i) the
product of (x) the Cash  Payment multiplied by (y) two exceeds (ii) the per
share exercise price  of such Cashout Option. From and after the Effective
Time, each Cashout  Option shall only represent the right to receive the cash
payment  provided in this Section 3.5(a); and   (ii) The remaining one-half
of the Target Options held by each  particular holder which are outstanding
at the Effective Time, whether or  not exercisable (each a "ROLLOVER
OPTION"), shall be converted into and  become rights with respect to Buyer
Common Stock, and Buyer shall assume  each Rollover Option, in accordance
with the terms of the Target Stock  Plan and stock option agreement by which
it is evidenced, except that from  and after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer
and its Compensation Committee  shall be substituted for Target and the
Committee of Target\'s Board of  Directors (including, if applicable, the
entire Board of Directors of  Target) administering such Target Stock Plan,
(ii) each Target Option  assumed by Buyer may be exercised solely for shares
of Buyer Common Stock  as provided below, (iii) such Target Options shall be
converted into Buyer  Options to purchase that number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock equal to  the number of shares of Target Common Stock subject to
such Target Options  immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
two times the  Exchange Ratio, and (iv) the per share exercise price for each
such Buyer  Option shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the per
share  exercise price under the applicable Target Option divided by (y) two
times  the Exchange Ratio and rounded up to the nearest cent; and   (iii)
In determining which Target Options of a particular holder are  to be treated
as Cashout Options and Rollover Options, the Cashout Options  and Rollover
Options shall be allocated equally to each particular grant  of Target
Options to such holder having different exercise prices and  terms and, to
the extent any such grant is not divisible evenly, the odd  Target Option
shall be treated as a Cashout Option.   (b) To the extent that a particular
holder of Target Options does not consent in writing to the conversion of his
or her Target Options pursuant to Section 3.5(a) hereof, or in the event that
such written consent is not delivered to Target within two business days
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, such holder\'s Target
Options which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable (the "CONVERSION OPTIONS"), shall be converted into and become
rights with respect to Buyer Common Stock and cash, and Buyer shall assume
each Conversion Option, in accordance with the terms of the Target Stock Plan
and stock option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and
after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer and its Compensation Committee shall be
substituted for Target and the Committee of Target\'s Board of Directors
(including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of Target)
administering such Target Stock Plan, (ii) each Target Option assumed by
Buyer may be exercised solely for shares of Buyer Common Stock and cash as
provided below, (iii) such Conversion Options shall be converted into Buyer
Options to purchase the sum of (a) that number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Target Common Stock subject to such
Conversion Options immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, plus (b) the Cash Payment times the number of shares of
Target Common Stock subject to such   -6-    Conversion Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) the per share exercise
price under each such Conversion Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per
share exercise price under the applicable Conversion Options by the Exchange
Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent.   (c) In the event that the
exercise of any Rollover Option or Conversion Option would result in the
issuance of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock such fractional share
shall be aggregated with all other fractional shares attributable to all
other Rollover Options then being exercised by such holder and to the extent
that such fractional shares thereafter remain, then such holder shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment for any remaining fractional shares based
upon the last sale price per share of Buyer Common Stock on the trading day
immediately preceding the date of exercise. From and after the Effective
Time, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall comply with the terms of the
Target Stock Plans.   At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause
to be taken all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Rollover Options in accordance with this Section 3.5. Promptly following
the Effective Time and in no event later than five business days following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Buyer Common Stock subject to the Rollover Options to be registered under the
Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate forms) and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) and to
thereafter maintain such effectiveness for so long as any Rollover Options
remain outstanding. Buyer and its Compensation Committee shall be substituted
for Target and the Committee of Target\'s Board of Directors (including, if
applicable, the entire Board of Directors of Target) administering such
Target Stock Plan.  3.6 FRACTIONAL SHARES.   No fraction of a share of
Buyer Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of shares of Target Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be received
by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificate or
Certificates, receive from Buyer an amount of cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Average Closing
Price.   ARTICLE 4 EXCHANGE OF SHARES  4.1 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.   (a) At
the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available to Buyer\'s transfer agent or
another exchange agent selected by Buyer (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for exchange
in accordance with this Section 4.1 the aggregate Merger Consideration. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer and
Target shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each    -7-    holder
of record of a certificate or certificates which represented shares of Target
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "CERTIFICATES")
appropriate transmittal materials and instructions (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange
Agent). The Certificate or Certificates of Target Common Stock so delivered
shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Target Common Stock represented by
Certificates that is not registered in the transfer records of Target,
the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificates representing such shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence such transfer and by
evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact
from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or
destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity as Buyer and the Exchange
Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other documents necessary to
evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof, the Exchange Agent shall
issue to such holder the consideration into which the shares represented by
such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have been
converted. The Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and
customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties as it may deem
appropriate.   (b) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Target
Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 or as
to which statutory dissenters\' rights have been perfected as provided in
Section 3.4) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the
Certificate or Certificates representing such shares to the Exchange Agent

reasonably be expected to have a Target Material Adverse Effect. Each Target
Entity is in compliance with each such Environmental Permit, and no
Environmental Permit restricts such Target Entity from operating any
equipment covered by such Environmental Permit as currently conducted, except
where any failure to comply with any such Environmental Permits would not,

-18-    5.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   (a) Target has disclosed in
Section 5.13 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, and has delivered or made
available to Buyer prior to the execution of this Agreement, (i) copies of
each material Employee Benefit Plan currently adopted, maintained by,
sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any Target Entity or
ERISA Affiliate thereof for the benefit of employees, former employees,
retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or other
beneficiaries or under which employees, retirees, former employees,
dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or
other beneficiaries are eligible to participate (collectively, the "TARGET
BENEFIT PLANS") and (ii) a list of each material Employee Benefit Plan that
is not identified in (i) above (e.g., former Employee Benefit Plans) but for
which the Target Entity or ERISA Affiliate has or reasonably could have any
obligation or Liability. Any of the Target Benefit Plans which is an
"employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in ERISA Section
3(2), is referred to herein as a "TARGET ERISA PLAN." Each Target ERISA Plan
which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Internal Revenue Code
Section 414(j)) is referred to herein as a "TARGET PENSION PLAN."   (b)
Target has made available to Buyer prior to the execution of this Agreement
(i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for all Employee
Benefit Plans, (ii) all determination letters, rulings, opinion letters,
information letters or advisory opinions issued by the IRS, the United States
Department of Labor ("DOL") or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation during this calendar year or any of the preceding three calendar
years, (iii) any filing or documentation (whether or not filed with the IRS)
where corrective action was taken in connection with the IRS EPCRS program
set forth in Revenue Procedure 2001-17 (or its predecessor or successor
rulings), (iv) annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial
statements, actuarial reports and valuations prepared for any Employee
Benefit Plan for the current plan year and the three preceding plan years,
and (v) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any material
modifications thereto.   (c) Except as previously disclosed to Buyer, each
Target Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the terms
of such Target Benefit Plan and the applicable requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code and ERISA. Each Target ERISA Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that is still in effect and
applies to the Target ERISA Plan as amended and as administered or, within
the time permitted under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(b), has timely
applied for a favorable determination letter which when issued will apply
retroactively to the Target ERISA Plan as amended and as administered. Target
is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. Except as disclosed in Section 5.13(c) of the
Target Disclosure Memorandum, Target has not received any communication
(written or unwritten) from any government agency questioning or challenging
the compliance of any Target Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. Except as
disclosed in Section 5.13(c) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, no Target
Benefit Plan is currently being audited by a governmental agency
for compliance with applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination
by the governmental agency that the Employee Benefit Plan failed to comply
with applicable Laws.    -19-     (d) There has been no oral or
written representation or communication with respect to any aspect of the
Employee Benefit Plans made to employees of any Target Entity or ERISA
Affiliate which is not in accordance with the written or otherwise
preexisting terms and provisions of such plans. No Target Entity, ERISA
Affiliate, administrator or fiduciary of any Target Benefit Plan (or
any agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in any transaction, or acted
or failed to act in any manner, which could subject the Target or Buyer to
any direct or indirect material Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for
breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary or other duty under ERISA. There are no
unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the
Target Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the
ordinary course of business and no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry,
hearing or investigation has been commenced with respect to any Target
Benefit Plan.   (e) All Target Benefit Plan documents and annual reports or
returns, audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations,
summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to
the Target Benefit Plans complete and correct in all material respects, have
been timely filed with the IRS, the DOL or distributed to participants of the
Target Benefit Plans (as required by Law), and there have been no material
changes in the information set forth therein.   (f) Except as previously
disclosed to Buyer, no "party in interest" (as defined in ERISA Section
3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section
4975(e)(2)) of any Target Benefit Plan has engaged in any material nonexempt
"prohibited transaction" (described in Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(c)
or ERISA Section 406).   (g) For any Target Pension Plan, the fair market
value of such Target Pension Plan\'s assets equals or exceeds the present
value of all benefits (whether vested or not) accrued to date by all present
or former participants in such Target Pension Plan. For this purpose the
assumptions prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for
valuing plan assets or liabilities upon plan termination shall be applied and
the term "benefits" shall include the value of all benefits, rights and
features protected under Internal Revenue Code Section 411(d)(6) or its
successors and any ancillary benefits (including disability, shutdown, early
retirement and welfare benefits) provided under any such Target Pension Plan
and all "benefit liabilities" as defined in ERISA Section 4001(a)(16). Since
the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, there has been (i) no
material change in the financial position of any Target Pension Plan, (ii) no
change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any Target Pension Plan,
and (iii) no increase in benefits under any Target Pension Plan as a result
of Target Pension Plan amendments or changes in any applicable Law which is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the funding status of such Target Pension Plan.
All contributions with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan of Target, or any
of its ERISA Affiliates that is subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 412
or ERISA Section 302 have or will be timely made and, with respect to any
such Employee Benefit Plan, there is no Lien nor is there expected to be a
Lien under Internal Revenue Code Section 412(n) or ERISA Section 302(f) or
Tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 4971. No Target Pension Plan has a
"liquidity shortfall" as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 412(m)(5).
Neither Target nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is subject to or can
reasonably be expected to become subject to a Lien under   
-20-    Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(29). All premiums required to
be paid under ERISA Section 4006 have been timely paid by Target and by its
ERISA Affiliates.   (h) No Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Target or its ERISA Affiliates and no event has
occurred that could reasonably result in material Liability under Title IV of
ERISA being incurred by Target or its ERISA Affiliates with respect to any
ongoing, frozen, or terminated single-employer plan of Target or the single-
employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. There has been no "reportable event,"
within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043 for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived by any ongoing, frozen, or terminated single
employer plan of Target or of an ERISA Affiliate.   (i) Except as disclosed
in Section 5.13 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, no Target Entity has any
material Liability for retiree health and life benefits under any of the
Target Benefit Plans and there are no restrictions on the rights of such
Target Entity to amend or terminate any such retiree health or benefit Plan
without incurring any material Liability thereunder except to the extent
required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Internal Revenue Code Section
4980B. No Tax under Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been
incurred with respect to any Target Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists
which is reasonably likely to give rise to such Taxes.   (j) Except as
disclosed in Section 5.13 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment (including
severance, termination indemnity, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, or otherwise) becoming due to any director, any employee or any
independent contractor of any Target Entity from any Target Entity under
any Target Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Target Benefit Plan or otherwise, or (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit.   (k)
The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred
compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive
compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of current
and former employees and current and former independent contractors of any
Target Entity and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements
accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, have been fully
reflected on the Target Financial Statements to the extent required by and in
accordance with GAAP.   (l) All individuals who render services to any
Target Entity and who are authorized to participate in a Target Benefit Plan
pursuant to the terms of such Target Benefit Plan are in fact eligible to and
authorized to participate in such Target Benefit Plan. All individuals
participating in (or eligible to participate in) any Target Benefit Plan are
common-law employees of a Target Entity, except where the terms of such plans
allow participation by persons who are not common law employees and as
provided in Section 5.13(l) of the Target Disclosure Memorandum.   
-21-     (m) On or after September 26, 1980, neither the Target nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has had an "obligation to contribute" (as defined in
ERISA Section 4212) to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Sections
4001(a)(3) and 3(37)(A)).   (n) Without limiting the foregoing provisions
of Section 5.13, except as disclosed in Section 5.13 of the Target Disclosure
Memorandum, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan maintained outside the
United States which is mandated by a government other than that of the United
States or subject to foreign Law (collectively, the "TARGET FOREIGN BENEFIT
PLANS"), (i) the terms of each Target Foreign Benefit Plan and the manner in
which it is and has been administered in operation are in material compliance
with all applicable Laws of the jurisdiction in which such Target Foreign
Benefit Plan is maintained, (ii) each Target Foreign Benefit Plan which is
required to be registered with or submitted to a foreign Regulatory Authority
for tax qualification or other approval has been so registered or submitted
and each such plan has received such approval, and Target is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such registration or
approval, (iii) all contributions to each Target Foreign Benefit Plan
required to be made through the Effective Time or required to be made with
respect to a period prior to the Effective Time have been or shall be made by
a Target Entity or, if applicable, shall be accrued in accordance with
applicable international accounting practices, and (iv) for any Target
Foreign Benefit Plan which, under the Laws of the applicable
foreign jurisdiction, is required to be funded, the fair market value of such
Target Foreign Benefit Plan\'s assets equals or exceeds the present value of
all benefits (whether vested or not) accrued to date by all present and
former participants in such Target Foreign Benefit Plan or such Target
Foreign Benefit Plan is fully insured, in each case based upon generally
accepted local accounting and actuarial practice and procedure.  5.14
MATERIAL CONTRACTS.   Except as disclosed in Section 5.14 of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum, none of the Target Entities, nor any of their
respective Assets, businesses, or operations, is a party to, or is bound or

termination, consulting, or retirement Contract providing for aggregate
payments to any Person in any calendar year in excess of $200,000, (ii) any

Target Entity without penalty and with 60 days or less notice), and (vii) any
other Contract or amendment thereto that would be required to be filed as an
exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by Target with the SEC as of the date of this
Agreement (each such Contract identified above, a "MATERIAL CONTRACT," and
together with all    -22-    Contracts referred to in Sections 5.9,
5.10 and 5.13(a), the "TARGET CONTRACTS"). Except as disclosed in Section
5.14 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum, with respect to each Target
Contract: (A) the Contract is in full force and effect; (B) to the Knowledge
of Target, no Target Entity is in Default thereunder; (C) no Target Entity

or pending, or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened (or unasserted but
considered probable of assertion and which if asserted would have at least a
reasonable possibility of an unfavorable outcome) against any Target Entity,
or against any director, officer or employee in their capacities as such or
Employee Benefit Plan of any Target Entity, or against any Asset, interest,
or right of any of them, that is reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Target Material Adverse Effect, nor are there any Orders
outstanding against any Target Entity, that are reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Target Material Adverse Effect.

provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provision of the Buyer Certificate of Incorporation or Buyer Bylaws, or (ii)
except as disclosed in Section 6.2 of the Buyer Disclosure Memorandum,
constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to,
or result in the creation of any Lien on any material Asset of any Buyer

Default or Lien,    -25-    or any failure to obtain such Consent,
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or, (iii) constitute or result in a Default

other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer
and the Person making the    -38-    offer, to be more favorable, from
a financial point of view, to Target\'s stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the terms of the Merger and is reasonably capable of being
consummated.  8.4 EXCHANGE LISTING.   Buyer shall use its reasonable
efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time, on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to
the holders of Target Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and upon the
exercise of the Target Options, and Buyer shall give all notices and make all
filings with the NYSE required in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.  8.5 ANTITRUST NOTIFICATION; CONSENTS OF REGULATORY
AUTHORITIES.   (a) To the extent required by the HSR Act, each of the
Parties shall, within a reasonable period of time, file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the United States Department of
Justice ("DOJ") the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall promptly file any supplemental or
additional information which may reasonably be requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, and shall comply in all material respects
with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each Party shall use its reasonable
efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to
the Merger under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,
as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
federal, state or foreign Law or, regulation or decree designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively "ANTITRUST LAWS"). In the event any
Litigation is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of
Antitrust Laws, each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid the
filing of, or resist or resolve such Litigation. Each Party shall use its
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required by: (i) the
DOJ and/or the FTC in order to resolve such objections as either of them may
have to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws, or (ii) any federal or state
court of the United States, or similar court of competent jurisdiction in any
foreign jurisdiction, in any suit brought by any Regulatory Authority or any
other Person challenging the Merger as violative of the Antitrust Laws, in
order to avoid the entry of any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order.
Reasonable efforts shall not include the willingness of Buyer to accept an
Order agreeing to the divestiture, or the holding separate, of any Assets of
any Buyer Entity or any Target Entity which Buyer reasonably determines to be
material to Buyer or to the benefits of the transaction for which it has
bargained for hereunder. Buyer shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or
negotiations with any Regulatory Authority relating to any of the foregoing,
provided that it shall afford Target a reasonable opportunity to participate
therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, no Buyer
Entity shall be required to divest any of its businesses, product lines or
Assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any
limitation, that Buyer reasonably determines to be material to Buyer or to
the benefits of the transaction for which it has bargained for
hereunder.    -39-      (b) The Parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other and use their reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings (which shall include the filings pursuant to subsection (a) above),
and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents of all Regulatory
Authorities and other Persons which are necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). The
Parties agree that they shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each Party shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.
Each Party also shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any
communication from any Regulatory Authority whose Consent is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes
such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
requisite Consent shall not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such Consent will be materially delayed.  8.6 FILINGS WITH STATE
OFFICES.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Sub shall execute and file the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in connection with the Closing.  8.7
AGREEMENT AS TO EFFORTS TO CONSUMMATE.   Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to
use, its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including using its reasonable efforts to lift or rescind
any Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to
in Article 9; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude either Party from
exercising its rights under this Agreement.  8.8 INVESTIGATION AND
CONFIDENTIALITY.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall keep
the other Party advised of all material developments relevant to its business
and to the consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party and
its advisors and agents to make or cause to be made such investigation of the
business and properties of it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective
financial and legal conditions as the other Party reasonably requests,
provided that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. No investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of
such Party to rely on the representations and warranties of the other
Party.   (b) In addition to the Parties\' respective obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement, which is hereby reaffirmed and adopted,
and incorporated by reference herein each Party shall, and shall cause its
advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all   
-40-    confidential information furnished to it by the other Party
concerning its and its Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations, and financial
positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall
promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies
thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information received
from the other Party.   (c) Each of Buyer and Sub, on the one hand, and
Target, on the other, agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by the other party that are expressly set forth in Article 5
and Article 6 of this Agreement, as applicable, neither the other party nor
any of its representatives or Affiliates has made and shall not be deemed to
have made to such party or to any of its representatives or Affiliates any
representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each party agrees that neither the other party nor any of its
Affiliates makes or has made any representation or warranty to such party or
to any of its representatives or Affiliates with respect to:   (i) any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of  future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations  (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof)  or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the other  party or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or  affairs of the other
party or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or  hereafter delivered to or
made available to such party or its counsel,  accountants, advisors, lenders,
representatives or Affiliates; and   (ii) any other information, statement
or documents heretofore or  hereafter delivered to or made available to such
party or its counsel,  accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or
Affiliates with respect  to the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the
business, operations  or affairs of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries, except to the  extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made by  the other party and contained in Article
5 or Article 6 of this Agreement,  as applicable.  8.9 PRESS RELEASES.  
Prior to the Effective Time, Target and Buyer shall consult with each other
as to the form and substance of any press release or other public disclosure
materially related to this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated
hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.9 shall be deemed to
prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel
deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Party\'s disclosure
obligations imposed by Law.  8.10 TAX TREATMENT.   (a) This Agreement is
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
Treasury regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, except as
provided in Section 1.4, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective   
-41-    Time, neither Sub, Buyer nor any of their Affiliates shall
knowingly take any action that could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) Target does not know
of any reason why Target will not be able to deliver to each of Alston and Bird
LLP and Vinson and Elkins LLP, at the time the Registration Statement or any
amendment thereto is filed with the SEC and on or about the Closing Date,
certificates in the form of Exhibit 4 hereto and substantially in compliance
with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable such firms to deliver the opinions
contemplated by Section 9.1(f).   (c) Buyer does not know of any reason why
Buyer will not be able to deliver to each of Alston and Bird LLP and Vinson and
Elkins LLP, at the time the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto
is filed with the SEC and on or about the Closing Date, certificates in the
form of Exhibit 4 hereto and substantially in compliance with IRS published
advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications
thereto, to enable such firms to deliver the opinions contemplated by Section
9.1(f).  8.11 AGREEMENT OF AFFILIATES.   Target has disclosed in Section
8.11 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum all Persons whom it reasonably
believes is an "affiliate" of Target for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933
Act. Target shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each such Person to
deliver to Buyer prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in
substantially the form of Exhibit 3, providing that such Person shall not
sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of Buyer Common
Stock to be received by such Person upon consummation of the Merger except in
compliance with applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Buyer shall be entitled to place restrictive
legends upon certificates for shares of Buyer Common Stock issued to
affiliates of Target pursuant to this Agreement to enforce the provisions of
this Section 8.11. Buyer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement under the 1933 Act for the purposes of resale
of Buyer Common Stock by such affiliates.  8.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND
CONTRACTS.   (a) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue to provide individuals
who were officers and employees of the Target Entities immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") with benefits under the
Target Benefit Plans (except that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide
benefits under stock option or other plans involving the potential issuance
of Buyer Common Stock or Target Common Stock other than as provided in
Section 3.5 of this Agreement) or similar arrangements, on terms and
conditions which when taken as a whole are substantially similar to those
which are provided to such officers and employees by the Target Entities
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with such changes as Buyer may
reasonably determine are required by law). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer may, at any time following the Effective Time and in its sole
discretion, discontinue providing benefits under any Target Benefit Plan
to Continuing Employees, provided that such Continuing Employees shall
thereafter receive benefits under Buyer\'s Employee Benefit Plans (except
that Buyer shall have no obligation to    -42-    provide benefits
under stock option or other plans involving the potential issuance of Buyer
Common Stock other than as provided in Section 3.5 of this Agreement), on
terms and conditions which taken as a whole are substantially similar to
those provided by the Buyer Entities to their similarly situated officers and
employees. In the event the Continuing Employees participate in Buyer\'s
Employee Benefit Plans at any time after the Effective Time then, (i) for
purposes of participation, vesting and (except in the case of
Buyer retirement plans) benefit accruals under Buyer\'s Employee Benefit
Plans, including the Termination Benefits Plan of Buyer, the service of
the Continuing Employees with the Target Entities prior to the Effective
Time shall be treated as service with a Buyer Entity participating in such
Employee Benefit Plans; and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the next
succeeding sentence, with respect to health, life, welfare and other group
benefits, Buyer\'s Employee Benefit Plans shall waive any eligibility
periods, evidence of insurability and pre-existing conditions limitations and
shall honor any deductible, co-payment, co-insurance or out-of-pocket
expenses paid or incurred for the current plan year by such Continuing
Employees, including, with respect to their covered dependents, under the
Target Benefit Plans during the period preceding the date of participation in
Buyer\'s Employee Benefit Plans, as though such amount had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer\'s Employee Benefit
Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer\'s undertaking set forth in
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall only be applicable to
Buyer\'s Employee Benefit Plans which are fully insured to the extent
permitted under the terms of the applicable insurance policy or to the extent
approved by the applicable insurance carrier. Buyer also shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their
terms all employment, severance, consulting and other compensation Contracts
disclosed in Section 8.12 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum to Buyer
between any Target Entity and any current or former director, officer, or
employee thereof, and all provisions for vested benefits or other vested
amounts earned or accrued through the Effective Time under the Target Benefit
Plans.   (b) Effective prior to the Effective Time, Target shall terminate
all of Target\'s severance and termination benefit plans, including without
limitation, the Target Severance Benefit Plan, as amended and restated
effective October 1, 2000, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to adopt the Termination Benefits Plan of Buyer and for
a period of at least one year following the Closing shall make such Buyer
plan available (and not reduce the benefits available thereunder) to the
Continuing Employees. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor the terms of
the Change of Control Agreements disclosed in Section 8.12 of the Target
Disclosure Memorandum.   (c) Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to permit all Continuing Employees to retain and take any
paid vacation days accrued but not taken or lost under the Target\'s and the
Target Entities\' vacation policies prior to the Effective Time, provided
that such vacation days are taken or paid in lieu of being taken within one
year after the Effective Time.    -43-     (d) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Target\'s Board of Directors or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the ESPP, shall adopt such
resolutions or take such actions as are required to (i) terminate such ESPP
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide that the offering period scheduled
to end on December 31, 2001 (the "FINAL OFFERING PERIOD") shall end on the
earlier of (a) December 31, 2001, or (b) the termination of the ESPP, and
(iii) provide that no new offering periods shall be commenced following
the termination of the Final Offering Period.  8.13 INDEMNIFICATION.  
(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Target Entities (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against all Liabilities
arising out of actions or omissions arising out of the Indemnified Party\'s
service or services as directors, officers, employees or agents of Target or,
at Target\'s request, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest
extent permitted under Delaware Law and by the Target Certificate of
Incorporation and Target Bylaws and their existing Indemnification Agreements
as in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation and whether or not any
Buyer Entity is insured against any such matter. Without limiting the
foregoing, in any case in which approval by the Surviving Corporation is
required to effectuate any indemnification, the Surviving Corporation shall
direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of
any such approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between Buyer and the Indemnified Party.   (b) Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable efforts (and Target shall
cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect
for a period of six years after the Effective Time Target\'s existing
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (provided that Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the written consent of Target
given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time and
covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance; provided, that
neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to make
aggregate annual premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such
policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the
portion related to Target\'s directors and officers, 150% of the annual
premium payments on Target\'s current policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the "MAXIMUM AMOUNT"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.   (c) Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section
8.13, upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall promptly
notify Buyer    -44-    and the Surviving Corporation thereof. In the
event of any such Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; provided, that Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Parties
shall cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation, and (iii) neither
Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent; and provided further that neither
Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law.   (d) If Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.13   (e) The
provisions of this Section 8.13(e) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs
and representatives.  8.14 BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BUYER.   The Board of
Directors of Buyer shall take all actions necessary such that effective as of
immediately following the Effective Time, two designee(s) of Target
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, one of whom shall be "independent" under the
rules of the NYSE, shall become a member of the Board of Directors of
Buyer.  8.15 SECTION 16(b) BOARD APPROVAL.   (a) Prior to Closing, the
Board of Directors of Buyer shall, by resolution duly adopted by such Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee of "non-employee directors"
thereof, approve and adopt, for purposes of exemption from "short-swing"
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the acquisition of Buyer
Common Stock at the Effective Time by officers and directors of Target
(including officers or directors of Target who become, prior to, at, or
following the Effective Time of the Merger, officers or directors of Buyer)
as a result of the conversion of shares of Target Common Stock in the Merger
and the assumption of the Target Options by Buyer at the Effective Time. Such
resolution shall set forth the name of the    -45-    applicable
"insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the number of
securities to be acquired by each individual, that the approval is being
granted to exempt the transaction under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act,
and, for the Target Options to be assumed by Buyer at the Effective Time, the
material terms of the options and warrants to purchase Buyer Common
Stock acquired by such insiders as a result of the assumption by Buyer of
such Target Options.   (b) Prior to Closing, the Board of Directors of
Target shall, by resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee of "non-employee directors" thereof, approve and adopt,
for purposes of exemption from "short-swing" liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act, the conversion at the Effective Time of the shares of
Target Common Stock held by officers and directors of Target into shares of
Buyer Common Stock and cash as a result of the conversion of shares in the
Merger, and the assumption and cashout by Buyer at the Effective Time of the
Target Options of the officers and directors of Target. Such resolution shall
set forth the name of the applicable "insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act and, for each "insider," the number of shares of Target
Common Stock to be converted into shares of Buyer Common Stock and cash at
the Effective Time, the number and material terms of the Options to be
assumed and cashed out by Buyer at the Effective Time, and that the approval
is being granted to exempt the transaction under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.   ARTICLE 9 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS TO
