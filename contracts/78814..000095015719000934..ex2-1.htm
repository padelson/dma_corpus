Purchaser (or one or more of its designated Affiliates) through the transfer

Section 1.3. _Consent to Assignment_.

 


 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, but subject
to _Section 5.5_ and _Section 5.6_ , this Agreement shall not constitute an 
agreement to sell, assign, transfer or convey any Transferred Asset or any
claim, right or benefit thereunder or arising therefrom (collectively, the "
_Interests_ "), if an  attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance of
such Interest would constitute a breach or a violation of any applicable Law,
or would adversely affect the rights of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
thereunder or, with respect to Contracts not  exclusively relating to the
Business, the Seller and its Affiliates thereunder, or if such Interest cannot
be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed without any third-party consent
that has not been obtained by (or does not remain in full force  and effect
at) the Applicable Closing (any such Interest, an

 


 

 

 

5  


 

 


 

 

" _Excluded Interest_ "), unless and until (i) such Excluded Interest can be
sold, assigned,  transferred or conveyed in accordance with _Section 1.2(a)_
without such a breach, violation of Law or adverse effect on the Seller's or
the Purchaser's rights thereunder or  (ii) such third-party consent is
obtained, at which time (with respect to any Excluded Interest, the "
_Excluded Interest Transfer Time_ "), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), 
such Excluded Interest and any related Assumed Liability shall be deemed to be
sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed in accordance with _Section 1.2(a)_
and assumed in  accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_ and shall cease to be an
Excluded Interest.

 


 

 

(b) During the twelve (12) months following the Applicable  Closing Date, to
the extent and during the period any Interest remains an Excluded Interest and
without further consideration (i)(x) the parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to 
cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangements (including by establishing
agency type or other similar arrangements or establishing subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing arrangements) reasonably satisfactory to both
parties to provide the  benefits and use of such Excluded Interest in all
material respects to the Purchaser or its designee, and (y) to the extent
permitted by Law, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
exercise, enforce and exploit, only at the direction  of and for the benefit
of the Purchaser, any and all claim, right or benefit of the Seller or its
Affiliates arising in connection with such Excluded Interest, and (ii) (x) the
Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, promptly  pay,
assign and remit to the Purchaser when received all monies and other
consideration relating to such Excluded Interest or any claim, right or
benefit thereunder, in each case, received by it following the Applicable
Closing and not transferred  to the Purchaser or its designee pursuant to
this Agreement and (y) the Purchaser or its designee shall promptly pay or
satisfy the corresponding liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Excluded Interest to the same extent the Purchaser  would have been
responsible therefor if such Excluded Interest had been transferred to the
Purchaser as of the Applicable Closing. The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to structure the provision of the benefits of
any  Excluded Interest to the Purchaser in a manner that does not result in
any member of the Seller Group or any of their Affiliates recognizing net
taxable income (taking into account any deductions available for payments made
to the Purchaser) with  respect to such structure; _provided_ that, if
notwithstanding such efforts any member of the Seller Group or any of their
Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity)  recognizes net taxable income
as a result of such structure (as reasonably determined by the Seller), then
the amount payable by the Seller shall be reduced by 25.5% of such net taxable
income. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, no
member of the Seller Group shall have any obligation to seek any third-party
consent or to cooperate in providing the benefits of any Excluded Interest to
the Purchaser, in either case, following the earlier of (i) the Excluded 
Interest Transfer Time for such Excluded Interest and (ii) the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Applicable Closing Date. The parties acknowledge
that the failure of any third party consent to be obtained or the failure of
any Interest to  constitute a Transferred Asset or any circumstances
resulting therefrom shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Business
Material Adverse Effect or a breach by the Seller of any representation,
warranty, condition, covenant or agreement contained  in this Agreement. No
member of the Seller Group shall be required to make any material expenditure
or incur any potential liability (other than any liability for immaterial
administrative or legal costs and expenses) in connection with any such 
activities described in this _Section 1.3(b)_ , unless reimbursed and/or fully
indemnified by the Purchaser for the full amount of any such expenditure or
liability.

from, all of the following Liabilities of any member of the Seller Group,

Transferred Business Contracts;

 


 

 

(ii) all Liabilities to the extent  arising under or relating to the
Transferred Real Property Leases, including all Liabilities to the extent

(vi) all Liabilities to the extent  relating to the Business or the
Transferred Assets arising under Environmental Laws;

 


 

 

(vii) all Liabilities to the extent arising  out of or relating to any

or arising out of the Business;

 


 

 

(ix) all other Liabilities to the extent  relating to, arising out of or
otherwise in any way in respect of the Business or the conduct or operation of
the Business and activities related thereto, whether before or after the
Principal Closing Date, or the ownership, use or operation of any 
Transferred Assets, in each case, whether or not presently asserted and
whether arising before, on or after the Principal Closing; and

 


 

 

(x) all Liabilities of the Transferred  Entities or their personal or real
property or other assets (or the ownership or operation thereof).

 


 

 

 

7  


 

 


 

 

The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the Transferred
Entities shall remain liable after the Principal Closing Date for all of their
respective  Liabilities and such Liabilities shall constitute Assumed
Liabilities (except to the extent such Liabilities constitute Excluded
Liabilities), and the Purchaser shall, as provided in _Article    VIII_ ,
indemnify and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from all such
Liabilities.

 


 

 

(b) _Excluded Liabilities_. The Purchaser shall not assume, and the term
"Assumed Liabilities" shall not include, any of the Excluded Liabilities. The
members of the Seller Group shall retain, and the Seller shall, as provided 
in _Article VIII_ , indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
harmless from, the Excluded Liabilities. The "Excluded Liabilities" shall
consist of the following:

 


 

 

(i) all Liabilities to the extent  related to the Excluded Assets, including
all Liabilities to the extent (A) relating to any business of any member of
the Seller Group other than the Business or (B) not relating to the Business
or the Transferred Assets;

 


 

 

(ii) all Liabilities to the extent any  member of the Seller Group is
expressly liable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby;

calculation of Transaction Expenses);

 


 

 

(v) all Liabilities arising from or  relating to any Action brought against
the Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective directors or
officers relating to or arising from this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby by any of the Seller's shareholders,  advisors or
representatives or any other prospective purchasers of the Business;

 


 

 

(vi) all Liabilities related to any  confidentiality agreements entered into

(ix) all Liabilities to the extent arising  out of or resulting from the

8  


 

 


 

 

_provided_ , _however_ ,  that any Liabilities of the Transferred Entities
(other than the Liabilities described in _Section 1.4(b)(i)(A)_ ) shall not
constitute Excluded Liabilities.

 


 

 

Section 1.5. _Purchase Price_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the  Principal Closing,
the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller (and/or to one or
more Affiliates of the Seller as designated by the Seller in such amounts
designated by the Seller, in each case, in writing), in immediately
available  funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated by
the Seller, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to (i) $700,000,000 (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Adjustment Amount (which may be
positive or negative) (the " _Closing Purchase Price_ ").     The Closing
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.8_.

 


 

 

(b) In the event that the portion of the Purchase Price  allocated to any
Deferred Jurisdiction set forth on _Section 1.5(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules is required by applicable Law to be paid in a Foreign Currency at
the  applicable Deferred Closing, (i) on the applicable Deferred Closing
Date, the local Subsidiary of the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller (or the
applicable local Selling Entity or other Affiliate of the Seller designated by
the Seller) an amount in  the applicable Foreign Currency equal to (A) such
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the applicable Deferred
Jurisdiction (as determined in accordance with _Section 2.4_ )  in U.S.
dollars _multiplied_ by (B) the Exchange Rate as of such Deferred Closing Date
with respect to each applicable Foreign Currency (each such payment, a "
_Local Consideration Payment_ ") and (ii) upon receipt of the applicable Local
Consideration Payment (as evidenced by a wire reference number or equivalent
documentation), the  Seller shall not later than the first (1st) Business Day
after such receipt refund to the Purchaser the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Deferred Jurisdiction (as determined in accordance with
_Section 2.4_ ) in U.S. dollars.

 


 

 

Section 1.6. _Pre-Closing Estimated Adjustment of Purchase Price_. No earlier
than five and no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Principal
Closing, the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser (i) a 
statement setting forth the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Estimated
Closing Cash, the Estimated Transferring Indebtedness, the Estimated
Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Adjustment Amount (such statement, the
" _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), such statement to be prepared in good
faith and in accordance with the accounting principles, practices,
assumptions, conventions and policies (including any  exclusions or
deviations from GAAP) set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Accounting Principles_
") and  (ii) reasonable supporting detail of each of the calculations set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. The Seller shall, and shall cause
each member of the Seller Group to, provide the Purchaser and its
representatives and advisors reasonable  access to the books, Contracts,

independent accountants and their work papers) and records of the Seller Group
and such representatives of the Seller Group relevant to the  Purchaser's
review of the Estimated Closing Statement. The Seller shall review any
comments proposed by the Purchaser with respect to the Estimated Closing
Statement and will consider, in good faith, any appropriate changes thereto
prior to the  Principal Closing; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Principal Closing Date shall not be delayed in any respect as a result of
any disagreement that the  Purchaser may have with respect to the Estimated
Closing Statement or any request with regards to backup data and the amounts
paid at the Principal Closing Date shall be based on the Estimated Closing
Statement.

Section 1.7. _Closing Adjustments Schedule_.

 


 

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety  (90) days after the
Principal Closing Date (the " _Closing Adjustments Schedule Deadline_ "), the
Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser (i) a schedule setting 
forth the Seller's calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Transferring Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the Final Purchase Price
(the " _Closing Adjustments  Schedule_ "), prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and (ii) reasonable supporting detail of each of the
calculations set forth in the Closing Adjustments Schedule. To the extent the
Seller does not deliver the Closing  Adjustments Schedule by the Closing
Adjustments Schedule Deadline, the Seller shall be deemed to have forfeited
the right to deliver the Closing Adjustments Schedule and the Purchaser shall,
as promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90)  days after the
Closing Adjustments Schedule Deadline, prepare and deliver to the Seller the
Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Adjustments Schedule (and the
components thereof), including reasonable supporting detail of each of the
calculations  set forth therein, and the provisions of _Section 1.7(b)_ and
_Section 1.7(c)_ shall apply, mutatis mutandis, with respect to the
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount and the Final Purchase Price;
_provided_ , that the Seller (in lieu of the Purchaser) shall be permitted to
disagree with the Purchasers calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

 


 

 

(b) If the Purchaser disagrees with the Seller's  calculation of the Final
Purchase Price delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ , the Purchaser may,
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the documents referred to in _Section
1.7(a)_ , deliver a written notice to the Seller disagreeing with any such
calculation and setting forth the Purchaser's calculation of the applicable
amounts and, in  reasonable detail, the Purchaser's good faith grounds for
such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items
or amounts as to which the Purchaser disagrees, and the Purchaser shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other  items and amounts contained in the
Closing Adjustments Schedule and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_. If no notice of  disagreement is
delivered in accordance with this _Section 1.7(b)_ , the Seller's calculations
of the Final Purchase Price, Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, 
Transferring Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses shall become final and
binding.

 


 

 

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered  pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_ , the Purchaser and the Seller shall, during the forty-five (45) days
following such delivery, negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable 
best efforts to reach agreement on any disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Transferring Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the Final Purchase
Price, and all  communications related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408
of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. If,
during such period, the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly after  the expiration of such period jointly
engage the Accountant, shall enter into a customary engagement letter with,
and, to the extent necessary shall waive and cause its Affiliates to waive
conflicts with the Accountant, and shall instruct the  Accountant promptly to
review this Agreement and the disputed items. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall instruct the Accountant to (i) consider, in making such calculation(s),
only those items or amounts in the Closing Adjustments Schedule  identified
in a statement furnished to the Accountant by the Seller and the Purchaser as
being disputed in the notice of

 


 

 

 

10  


 

 


 

 

disagreement (which such statement shall include the position, including the
specific amount proposed, of each of the Seller and the Purchaser with respect
to each such  disputed item as set forth in the notice of disagreement and
the Closing Adjustments Schedule, respectively), (ii) prepare its calculations
and render its decision consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and not
by an independent review, and  (iii) deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller,
within thirty (30) days, a report setting forth such calculations, which, in
each case, shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in the Seller's
calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ , nor less than the amount
thereof shown in the Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to
_Section   1.7(b)_. The scope of the Accountant's review shall be limited to
whether the amounts of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Transferring
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses in the notice of disagreement delivered
pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ remaining in dispute were prepared in accordance
with this _Section 1.7_ and the other  terms of this Agreement and,
specifically, the Accounting Principles and whether there were mathematical
errors in the relevant Closing Adjustments Schedule, and the Accountant shall
not be authorized or permitted to make any other determination.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Accountant is not authorized or
permitted to make any determination as to the accuracy of _Section 3.6_ or any
other  representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by
the Seller, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates with any of
the covenants in this Agreement (other than this _Section 1.7_ ) or as to
whether the Target Working Capital is correct, adequate or sufficient. The
Accountant's report shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the
Seller, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error.   The Purchaser and the
Seller shall each pay their own fees and expenses in connection with the
resolution of any disputes by the Accountant and the fees and expenses of the
Accountant shall be paid by the Purchaser and the Seller in inverse 
proportion to the difference between the Final Purchase Price proposed by each
of them and the Final Purchase Price as determined by the Accountant. For
example, should the amount of the items in dispute total $1,000 and the
Accountant awards $600  in favor of the Seller's position, 60% of the costs
of its review would be borne by the Purchaser and 40% of the costs would be
borne by the Seller.

 


 

 

(d) The Purchaser and the Seller agree that they will, and  agree to cause
their respective Affiliates, independent accountants and advisors and the
personnel of the Business to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Adjustments Schedule and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, 
Closing Cash, Transferring Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and in the
conduct of the Accountant's review referred to in this _Section 1.7_ ,
including the making  available during normal business hours upon reasonable
notice and subject to Section 5.2, to the extent necessary, of books,
Contracts, records, work papers, personnel, representatives (including their
respective advisors and independent  accountants and their work papers) and
any other information reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and
reviewing the calculations contemplated by this _Section 1.7_ ;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Purchaser and the Seller shall concurrently make a
copy of  all written information provided to the Accountant available to the
other party and notify the other party reasonably in advance so that it may
have its representatives and advisors participate in any meetings with the
Accountant and (ii) the  independent accountants of the Purchaser or the
Seller shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the
other party or to the Accountant unless and until such party or the
Accountant, as applicable, has signed a customary  confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 


 

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 1.7_ and _Section 1.8_ are not
intended to be used to permit the introduction of different  judgments,
accounting methodologies (including with respect to estimation methodologies,
accruals and reserves), policies, principles, practices,

 


 

 

 

11  


 

 


 

 

procedures or classifications for purposes of calculating amounts referred to
in this _Section 1.7_ ,  or to adjust for any inconsistencies between the
Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other, or errors or
omissions that may be found with respect to the Financial Statements
referenced in _Section 3.6_ or any inconsistencies between the Financial
Statements (or the Sample Statement on _Exhibit A_ ) and GAAP. The  Closing
Adjustments Schedule will entirely disregard (i) any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by the Purchaser or any other
transaction entered into by the Purchaser in connection with the consummation
of the  transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any of the plans,
transactions or changes which the Purchaser intends to or does initiate or
make or cause to be initiated or made on or after the Principal Closing with
respect to the Business, or any facts  or circumstances that are unique or
particular to the Purchaser or any of its assets or liabilities.

 


 

 

Section 1.8. _Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 


 

 

(a) Following the final determination of Final Purchase  Price, Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Transferring Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses pursuant to _Section 1.7_ , a payment (the " _Final Purchase Price
Adjustment_ ") shall be made by the Seller (or one or more Affiliates
designated by the Seller) to the Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates
designated by the Purchaser), or by the  Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates
designated by the Purchaser) to the Seller (or one or more Affiliates
designated by the Seller), as applicable, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. The Final Purchase Price Adjustment shall be an amount  equal to the
Closing Purchase Price, _minus_ the Final Purchase Price. If the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment is positive, such amount shall be paid to the
Purchaser (or  one or more Affiliates designated by the Purchaser) by the
Seller (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Seller), and if the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment is negative, the absolute value of such amount shall
be paid to the Seller (or one or  more Affiliates designated by the Seller)
by the Purchaser (or one or more Affiliates designated by the Purchaser).

 


 

 

(b) _Method of Payment_. Any payments pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ shall be
made in U.S. dollars and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately 
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the receiving party
within ten (10) days after Final Purchase Price has been determined.

 


 

 

Section 1.9. _Withholding_. The Purchaser, the Seller, the Transferred
Entities and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to withhold, or
cause to be withheld, from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement such 
amounts as are required to be withheld under applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that such amounts are so withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental
Authority, such withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this  Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. If the Purchaser, the Seller or any other
applicable withholding agent determines that it may need to withhold any Tax
under this _Section 1.9_ , it shall provide reasonable notice to the Person in
respect of which such withholding is required to be made, and the parties
shall use commercially reasonable  efforts to reduce or eliminate such
withholding. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Principal Closing Date, a
statement to the Seller setting forth (a) whether it has  determined that it
is required to withhold any Tax with respect to the payment of the Closing
Purchase Price and (b) the amount required to be withheld and a reasonably
detailed description of the basis for such withholding.

ARTICLE II 
  
  CLOSING; CLOSING DELIVERIES

 


 

 

Section 2.1. _Closings_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Parent Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets, the transfer
of the Transferred Employees and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities,
in  each case, in the Initial Jurisdictions (the " _Principal Closing_ ")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Cravath, Swaine
and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth  Avenue, New York, New York 10019 on the second (2nd)
Business Day after all conditions to the obligations of the Purchaser and the
Seller under _Article VI_ shall have been  satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Principal Closing, but subject to their
satisfaction or waiver at such time) or at such other place and time  as the
parties may agree; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the satisfaction of the
conditions to the obligations of the Purchaser and the Seller under _Article
VI_ (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the waiver thereof by the
parties entitled to waive such conditions), unless otherwise agreed in writing
by the  Purchaser, the parties shall not be required to affect the Principal
Closing prior to November 25, 2019 (the " _Inside Closing Date_ "); _provided_
, _further_ , that the Seller may, in its sole discretion, elect to delay the
Principal Closing to the first (1st)  day of the month immediately following
the date such conditions under _Article VI_ shall have been satisfied or
waived, as set forth above, and if such day is not a  Business Day, the
Principal Closing shall take place on the first (1st) Business Day thereafter
(though the Principal Closing shall remain effective as of such first (1st)
day of such month in accordance with _Section 2.2)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if  the Principal Closing is delayed pursuant to the immediately
foregoing proviso to a date that is after the Termination Date, then
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall
not be entitled to terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(ii)
until after such date. The date on which the Principal Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the " _Principal Closing Date_." In  accordance with
_Section 2.5_ , the closing of the transfer of the Transferred Parent Equity
Interests, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Employees in any
Deferred  Jurisdictions, and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in any
Deferred Jurisdictions will be effected on one or more Deferred Closing Dates
after the Principal Closing Date. The parties specifically acknowledge that
time is of the essence  because the Seller's intention to exit the Business
is or will become known to its employees, customers, vendors and others having
dealings with the Seller.

 


 

 

Section 2.2. _Effectiveness_. For all economic, accounting and Tax purposes
(in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law), the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement relating to (a) the  Initial
Jurisdictions shall be deemed to take place on the Principal Closing Date at
12:01 a.m., local time, in each Initial Jurisdiction and (b) the Deferred
Jurisdictions shall be deemed to take place on the applicable Deferred Closing
Date at  12:01 a.m., local time, in each Deferred Jurisdiction (the time
specified in clause (a) or (b), the " _Effective Time_ "); _provided_ that, in
the case of clause (a) or (b), if the Applicable Closing Date is on the first
(1st) Business Day of the month and such Business Day is not the first (1st)
day of the month, the Effective Time shall be  deemed to be 12:01 a.m., local
time in the applicable jurisdiction, on the first (1st) day of such month.

Section 2.4. _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 


 

 

(a) The Seller, on behalf of itself and the Selling  Entities, and the
Purchaser have agreed to allocate the Purchase Price and the amount of the
Assumed Liabilities (along with any other amounts treated as consideration for
the Transferred Parent Equity Interests and the Transferred Assets for U.S. 
Federal income Tax purposes) among (x) the applicable members of the Seller
Group and (y) the Transferred Parent Equity Interests (or, if the applicable
Transferred Parent Entity is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner
for U.S. Federal  income Tax purposes, such Transferred Parent Entity's
assets) and the Transferred Assets sold by each such member (the "
_Allocation_ ") pursuant to the procedures of this _Section 2.4_ and in
accordance with applicable Law.

 


 

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Principal Closing  Date, the Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser a draft of the Allocation based on the Closing
Purchase Price (the " _Preliminary Allocation_ ").

 


 

 

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the final determination  of the Final
Purchase Price, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a proposed draft of
the Allocation based on the Final Purchase Price (the " _Seller 's Proposed
Allocation_"),    for the Purchaser's review and approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Purchaser
agrees that promptly after approving the Seller's Proposed Allocation, it
shall sign the Seller's Proposed Allocation  and return an executed copy
thereof to the Seller, and the Seller's Proposed Allocation shall become final
and binding on the parties as the Allocation.

 


 

 

(d) In the event that the Purchaser does not agree with the  Seller's
Proposed Allocation and provides the Seller with written notice of such
disagreement, and the basis for such disagreement, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Seller's Proposed Allocation, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall  negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences; _provided_
that, if the Purchaser does not provide such written notice within thirty (30)
days after the delivery of the  Seller's Proposed Allocation, the Seller's
Proposed Allocation shall become final and binding on the parties as the
Allocation.

 


 

 

(e) In the event that the Purchaser has timely provided  written notice of
its disagreement with the Seller's Proposed Allocation and the Purchaser and
the Seller are unable to resolve any differences (after having negotiated in
good faith) within twenty-five (25) days after delivery of such notice of 
disagreement by the Purchaser to the Seller, the parties shall retain the
Accountant to resolve the dispute. The parties shall direct the Accountant to
resolve the dispute in compliance with this _Section 2.4_. The fees and
expenses of such Accountant shall be allocated between the Purchaser and the
Seller in accordance with the principles of the last two sentences of _Section
1.7(c)_ , and the Seller's Proposed Allocation, as adjusted by such
Accountant, shall become final and binding on the parties as the Allocation.

 


 

 

(f) Subject to _Section 2.4(g)_ below, the Purchaser and the Seller shall file
and cause to be filed all Tax Returns and execute such other documents as may
be required by any Taxing Authority, in a manner consistent with the 
Allocation, and shall not take any position inconsistent with the Allocation
in any examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim or in any Tax
Proceeding, in each case except as required by applicable Tax Law.

 


 

 

 

16  


 

 


 

 

(g) In the event that the Allocation has not become final  pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ by the date on which the first relevant Tax Return must be
timely filed (taking into account any available extension of time to file):

 


 

 

(i) The Preliminary Allocation or, if  available, the Seller's Proposed
Allocation shall be used for the purpose of filing any such relevant Tax
Return; and

 


 

 

(ii) If, as a result of a difference  between the Allocation, the Preliminary
Allocation and the Seller's Proposed Allocation, as applicable, it becomes
necessary to amend and refile any of the Tax Returns referred to in (i) above,
then such Tax Returns shall be amended and refiled,  and each party shall
bear its own costs and expenses related to any such amendment and refiling.

 


 

 

(h) In the event that the Allocation has not become final  pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ by the Applicable Closing, the allocated purchase prices
included in the Preliminary Allocation or the Seller's Proposed Allocation
shall be used  for the purpose of (A) including allocated purchase prices in
the Local Transfer Agreements for each Deferred Jurisdiction and (B)
determining the amount of any payments deemed to be made on the Principal
Closing Date to the applicable Selling  Entity with respect to such Deferred
Jurisdiction. The inclusion of such allocated purchase prices shall not be
deemed to waive, amend or otherwise alter any of the rights or obligations of
the parties set forth in this _Section 2.4_ and shall not be used for any
purpose in resolving, or result in any prejudice with respect to, any dispute
with respect to the Preliminary Allocation, the Seller's Proposed  Allocation
or the Allocation.

 


 

 

Section 2.5. _Deferred Closings_.

 


 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if  (i) all of the
conditions of _Article VI_ to the extent relating to the Principal
Jurisdictions have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their  terms are to be satisfied at the Principal Closing) and (ii) any
(x) consent, approval or employee information and/or consulting obligations
from or with any employee consultation body or other similar body or (y) other
filing, consent, approval or  action of any Governmental Authority or third
party, in each case, set forth on _Section 2.5(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules
(each such consent, approval, obligation,  filing or action, an " _Ancillary
Jurisdiction Approval_ "), shall not have been obtained or completed by the
time such conditions are satisfied or waived (other than those  conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Principal Closing), then the
transfer of the Transferred Parent Equity Interests, Transferred Assets and
the Transferred Employees and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in
the  jurisdiction in which such Ancillary Jurisdiction Approval has not been
obtained or completed (each, a " _Deferred Jurisdiction_ ") (such Transferred
Parent Equity Interests,  Transferred Assets, Transferred Employees and
Assumed Liabilities, collectively, a " _Deferred Business_ ") will not occur
on the Principal Closing Date, but shall instead  occur as set forth in this
_Section 2.5_ and the Disapplied Provisions shall apply to the Deferred
Business as of the applicable Deferred Closing Date and not as of the 
Principal Closing Date. In respect of the Disapplied Provisions, (A) the term
"Business" shall be deemed to exclude such Deferred Business, (B) the term
"Transferred Equity Interests" shall be deemed to exclude the Transferred
Equity Interests in  such Deferred Jurisdiction, (C) the term "Transferred
Parent Equity Interests" shall be deemed to exclude the Transferred Parent
Equity Interests in such Deferred Jurisdiction, (D) the term "Transferred

 


 

 

 

17  


 

 


 

 

Assets" shall be deemed to exclude the Transferred Assets in such Deferred
Jurisdiction, (E) the term "Assumed Liabilities" shall be deemed to exclude
the Assumed  Liabilities in such Deferred Jurisdiction and (F) the term
"Transferred Employees" shall be deemed to exclude the Transferred Employees
in such Deferred Jurisdiction, in each case, as of the Principal Closing (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, such  terms shall be deemed to include the
Deferred Business and the Transferred Equity Interests, Transferred Parent
Equity Interests, Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Transferred
Employees in such Deferred Jurisdictions on and following the  applicable
Deferred Closing Date).

 


 

 

(b) The closing of each transfer of a Deferred Business (a  " _Deferred
Transfer_ ") will be effected on the first (1st) day of the month immediately
following the date on which (i) the relevant Ancillary Jurisdiction Approval
has been  obtained or completed (each such closing, a " _Deferred Closing_ ")
and (ii) the other conditions to the obligations of the Purchaser and the
Seller under _Section 6.4_ to the extent relating to the applicable Deferred
Jurisdiction have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied  at the applicable Deferred Closing);
_provided_ that, if such day is not a Business Day in the applicable Deferred
Jurisdiction, then such Deferred Transfer shall take  place on the first
(1st) Business Day thereafter, though in accordance with _Section 2.2_ , the
Deferred Transfer shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m., local time in 
such Deferred Jurisdiction, on the first (1st) day of the month. The parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that any Deferred Transfer occurs
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Principal Closing Date (the date
on which the  Deferred Transfer occurs, the " _Deferred Closing Date_ ") in
accordance with this _Section 2.5_.   For the avoidance of doubt, the
Principal Closing Date shall not be delayed as a result of any Deferred
Transfer and there shall be no change in the amount paid at the Principal
Closing pursuant to _Section 1.5_ as a result of any Deferred Transfer.
Notwithstanding that legal title to the Deferred Businesses will not be
transferred to the Purchaser on the Principal Closing Date, all provisions of
this Agreement  (including the calculation of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Transferring Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses) shall apply
to the parties as though such transfer occurred at the Principal Closing,
except to the extent otherwise expressly  provided in this _Section 2.5_.
Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates makes any representation or
warranty of any kind whatsoever, whether express or implied, at  Law or in
equity, with respect to the Deferred Businesses, other than as set forth in
_Article III_ of this Agreement and the certificates delivered pursuant to
Section  2.3(c) and _Section 6.2(c)_ and, except with respect to the
certificates delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(c), then only as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the  Principal Closing Date, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) During the period from the Principal Closing Date  through (and
including) the Deferred Closing Date (the " _Interim Period_ "), each Deferred
Business will be held for the Purchaser's (or its designated Affiliate's)
benefit  and account and will be managed and operated by a member of the
Seller Group for the Purchaser's (or its designated Affiliate's) benefit and
account, including, for the avoidance of doubt, all items of income, gain and
loss, which shall be  calculated as set forth on _Section 2.5(c)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules, and (i) any such income or gain attributable to the
Deferred Business shall be paid over to the  Purchaser by the Seller or its
Affiliate promptly upon the request of the Purchaser and (ii) the Purchaser or
its Affiliate shall reimburse and/or indemnify and hold harmless the Seller or
its Affiliate for any such loss attributable to the  Deferred Business
promptly upon the request of the Seller (and any such Losses shall be deemed
to be Assumed Liabilities for purposes of, and subject to the limitations in,
_Article_

 


 

 

 

18  


 

 


 

 

_VIII_ ). The income, gain and loss attributable to the Deferred Business
shall be calculated  in accordance with the Seller's accounting policies and
practices used in the preparation of the interim monthly accounts.

 


 

 

(d) During the Interim Period, subject to and as permitted  by applicable Law
(including laws necessary to accomplish mandatory transfers of employment, as
applicable), the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Deferred Business to be operated on a basis consistent with past 
practice, but in all cases, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including _Section 5.1_ ) and the other Transaction Documents.

 


 

 

(e) During the Interim Period, if all remaining Deferred  Closings have not
occurred by the date that is six (6) months after the Principal Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller a monthly fee of $50,000 (the "
_Administrative  Fee_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Fee
shall be in addition to expenses, costs and other Losses payable to the Seller
pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_.     From the date that is six (6) months
after the Principal Closing Date to the final Deferred Closing Date, the
Seller shall invoice the Purchaser for the Administrative Fee in advance each
month and the Purchaser shall pay each invoice no later than  thirty (30)
days after the receipt of such invoice. If any invoice is not paid when due,
the Seller may charge the Purchaser, in addition to the Administrative Fee,
interest at the Applicable Rate, or a lesser rate that is the maximum
permitted by  applicable Law, calculated on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed divided by 365, from the due date to, but not including, the date
of actual payment. Payment of such invoices shall be made by the Purchaser to
the Seller in U.S. dollars  in immediately available funds by wire transfer
to an account designated by the Seller.

 


 

 

(f) Except to the extent relating to or arising out of  fraud, bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct by a member of the Seller Group, the
Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group from and against
any and all Losses which the Seller Group may incur or suffer, to the extent 
such Losses arise out of or as a result of the Seller Group's post-Principal
Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or operation of each Deferred
Business (and any such Losses shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities for
purposes of, and  subject to the limitations in, _Article VIII_ ); _provided_
that such management or operation is  in all material respects in accordance
with, and not in breach of, the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including _Section 5.1_ ) and the other Transaction Documents.

 


 

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the  contrary in this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall have a one time right to elect, exercisable by
delivering written notice of such election to the Seller on or prior to the
day that is sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, to defer the 
transfer of the Transferred Parent Equity Interests, Transferred Assets and
the Transferred Employees and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in one
or more of the jurisdictions set forth on _Section 2.5(g)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules (each, an " _Optional Deferred Jurisdiction_ ") until a date that is
no later than one hundred (100)  days after the Inside Closing Date (the
period of any such deferral with respect to any Optional Deferred
Jurisdiction, the applicable " _Optional Deferred Closing Period_ "),  in
which case, if the Principal Closing Date occurs:

 


 

 

(i) prior to the expiration of the  applicable Optional Deferred Closing
Period with respect to any Optional Deferred Jurisdiction, such Optional
Deferred Jurisdiction shall be deemed to be a Deferred Jurisdiction and the
Transferred Parent Equity Interests,

 


 

 

 

19  


 

 


 

 

Transferred Assets, Transferred Employees and Assumed Liabilities with respect
to such Optional Deferred Jurisdiction shall be deemed to be a Deferred 
Business, in each case, for purposes of this _Section 2.5_ , without regard to
whether any Ancillary Jurisdiction Approval has been obtained or completed
with respect thereto,  and, for purposes of applying _Section 2.5(b)_ , the
date on which the relevant Ancillary Jurisdiction Approval has been obtained
or completed with respect to such Optional  Deferred Jurisdiction shall be
deemed to be the later of (x) the actual date such Ancillary Jurisdiction
Approval is obtained or completed and (y) the date on which such Optional
Deferred Closing Period expires; or

 


 

 

(ii) from and after the expiration of the  applicable Optional Deferred
Closing Period with respect to any Optional Deferred Jurisdiction, such
Optional Deferred Jurisdiction shall not constitute a Deferred Jurisdiction
unless the applicable Ancillary Jurisdiction Approval has not been  obtained
or completed on or prior to the Principal Closing Date as provided in _Section
2.5(a)_ and the Seller shall have no further right to defer the transfer of
the  Transferred Parent Equity Interests, Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Employees and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities with
respect to such Optional Deferred Jurisdiction.

 


 

 

ARTICLE III 
  
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

 


 

 

The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser that, except as set
forth on the disclosure schedules delivered by the Seller to the  Purchaser
concurrently herewith (the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") (subject to _Section
9.7_ ):

 


 

 

Section 3.1. _Due Organization_.

 


 

 

(a) Each Selling Entity and Transferred Entity is duly  organized, validly
existing and, where such concept is recognized in the applicable jurisdiction
and to the extent legally relevant, in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each Selling Entity and Transferred Entity  (i)
has all requisite power and authority under its organizational documents to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets related to the Business
(including the Transferred Assets) and to conduct the Business conducted by
such entity as it  is currently conducted and (ii) is duly qualified or
otherwise authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the
ownership, operation or leasing of the Transferred Assets (and the assets held
by a Transferred Entity) by such  entity and the conduct of the Business
conducted by such entity requires such entity to be so qualified or otherwise
authorized except, in the case of clause (i) and (ii), as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material  Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

(b) The Seller has made available to the Purchaser true,  complete and
correct copies of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other
constituent organizational documents of each Transferred Entity, each as
amended to the date hereof, and each as so made available is in full force and
effect on the  date hereof.

 


 

 

Section 3.2. _Authority_. Each Selling Entity has the requisite power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which

 


 

 

 

20  


 

 


 

 

such Selling Entity is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by each Selling
Entity of the  Transaction Documents to which such Selling Entity is a party
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such
Selling Entity, and no other  corporate or other proceedings on the part of
such Selling Entity are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by such Selling Entity of such Transaction Documents or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or  thereby. This Agreement
has been, and upon their execution the other Transaction Documents shall have
been, duly executed and delivered by each applicable Selling Entity, and,
assuming due authorization and delivery by the Purchaser and, if  applicable,
its Affiliates, this Agreement constitutes, and assuming due authorization and
delivery by the other parties thereto, upon their execution the other
Transaction Documents shall constitute, a valid and binding obligation of each
applicable  Selling Entity, enforceable against such Selling Entity in
accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws now or hereafter in effect  relating to or affecting creditors'
rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
(collectively, the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

 


 

 

Section 3.3. _Title to Transferred Equity Interests_.

 


 

 

(a) _Section 3.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth, as of the date of
this Agreement and for each Transferred Entity, the number of authorized,
issued and outstanding equity interests in such Transferred Entity (such 
issued and outstanding equity interests, the " _Transferred Equity Interests_
"), the record and beneficial owners thereof and the jurisdiction of
incorporation or legal  organization of such Transferred Entity. Except as
set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, there are no other
authorized, issued or outstanding shares  of capital stock or other equity
interests of each such Transferred Entity.

 


 

 

(b) The Transferred Equity Interests have been duly  authorized and validly
issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable. Other than this Agreement, no
Transferred Entity is, and prior to the Applicable Closing Date will not
become, a party to or subject to any contract or obligation wherein any 
third party has, or will have, a right, option or warrant to purchase or
acquire any rights in any additional equity interests of any Transferred
Entity. None of the issued Transferred Equity Interests was issued in
violation of any preemptive  rights, rights of first offer, rights of first
refusal or similar rights. Each applicable Selling Entity is the record and
legal and beneficial owner of, and has good and valid title to, its
Transferred Parent Equity Interests and, upon  consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, assuming the Purchaser has the requisite
power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Transferred Parent Equity
Interests, good and valid title to the Transferred Parent Equity Interests 
shall pass to the Purchaser, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than
those arising from acts of the Purchaser or its Affiliates, and the
Transferred Parent Equity Interests purchased by the Purchaser and the other
Transferred Equity  Interests held by the Transferred Parent Entities shall
collectively constitute all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of

separately lists or indicates each Assumed Benefit Plan. The Seller has

of the following with  respect to each Business Benefit Plan required to be
listed in _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, if applicable: (i) a

(b) Each Assumed Benefit Plan with respect to which the  Purchaser could have
any material Liability hereunder is and has been operated in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and with all applicable Laws including
ERISA and the Code. With respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan which operates 
in the UK and which is intended to meet any obligations of a Seller entity to
its employees under the auto-enrolment obligations contained in the UK
Pensions Act 2008, such Assumed Benefit Plan is either a "Qualifying Scheme"
or an "Auto-enrollment  Scheme" under that UK legislation. With respect to
each such Assumed Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, each such plan has been determined by the IRS to be so
qualified as to form, and each trust  forming a part thereof has been
determined by the IRS to be exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the
Code. To the Knowledge of the Seller, no reason exists that would reasonably
be expected to cause such qualified status to be revoked for  any period.

Knowledge of the Seller, asserted against any of the Assumed Benefit Plans,
the assets of any of the trusts under such plans, the plan sponsors, the plan
administrator or any fiduciary of any such plan (other than routine benefit
claims)  that could result in the imposition of any material Liability on the
Purchaser. There are no investigations or audits by any Governmental Authority
of any such Assumed Benefit Plans, any trusts under such plans, the plan
sponsor, the plan  administrator or any fiduciary of any such plan that have
been instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened.

 


 

 

(d) No Assumed Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or  Section 302 of ERISA
or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code. No liabilities under any Assumed Benefit
Plan relate to any employees of the Seller Group, other than Business
Employees or Former Employees who were employed by a Transferred Entity. No 
member of the Seller Group is obligated to contribute to any multiemployer
plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on behalf of any Business
Employee. With respect to each member of the Seller Group or any Person or
entity that would be  treated as

 


 

 

 

29  


 

 


 

 

a single employer with any member of the Seller Group for purposes of Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, there does not exist, nor do any
circumstances exist  that would reasonably be expected to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would result in any liability, prior to, at or
after the Applicable Closing, to the Purchaser or any entity that, together
with the Purchaser, is treated as a single  employer under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code, in an amount that would be material to the
Business, the Transferred Entities and the Transferred Assets, taken as a
whole.

 


 

 

(e) Except as would not be material to the Business, the  Transferred
Entities and the Transferred Assets, taken as a whole, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and the consummation by each member
of the Seller Group of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (alone  or in combination with any other event) result in an increase in
the amount of compensation or benefits or the acceleration of the vesting or
timing of payment of any compensation or benefits payable to or in respect of
any current or former  employee, officer, director or independent contractor
of the Business or any increased or accelerated funding obligation with
respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan. No amount paid or payable (whether in
cash, in property, or in the form of benefits)  in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in connection
with any other event) will or would reasonably be expected to be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 


 

 

(f) _Section 3.4_ , _Section 3.6_ and this _Section 3.14_ contain the 
exclusive representations and warranties of the Seller with respect to the
Business Benefit Plans.

Schedules, or (ii) as provided in _Section 5.5(a)(i)_ , no consent of, or

represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or
matured liability.

as  applicable, shall enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with
the party providing such access. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this _Section 5.4(c)_ ,  no party shall be required to disclose to
the other or its representatives any information if doing so would, in the
reasonable and good faith judgment of counsel to such party, violate
confidentiality obligations, attorney-client privilege or  applicable Law (

use commercially reasonable efforts to seek alternative means to disclose
such  information as nearly as possible without adversely affecting such
confidentiality obligations, attorney client privilege or applicable Law).

concerning  the valuation of the Transferred Equity Interests or the
Transferred Assets or the Purchaser's consideration of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or other competitively sensitive material;

designate any materials provided to the other under this _Section 5.5_ as

the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction
or other  order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (1) the defense through
litigation on the merits of any  claim asserted in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions, (2) the proffer and agreement by the  Purchaser or its
Affiliates of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of,
or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale,
lease, license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, rights, 
product lines, categories of assets or businesses or other operations or
interests therein of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Applicable Closing, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Entities)
(and the entry into  agreements with, and submission to orders of, the
relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto) and (3) the proffer and
agreement by the Purchaser and its Affiliates of their willingness to take
such other actions, and promptly to effect  such other actions (and the entry
into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental
Authority giving effect thereto), in each case if such action should be

 


 

 

 

48  


 

 


 

 

necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or
threatened (I) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or  (II) issuance
of any order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority and
(B) the prompt  use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in  any proceeding or inquiry of any
kind that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal
thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or
threatened  injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation as soon as possible following the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the
Purchaser or its Affiliates  shall not be obligated (and, for clarity, the
Seller and its Affiliates shall not be permitted (without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser)) to take any of the foregoing actions in this
_Section 5.5(a)(ii)_ that would, either individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on either (A) the
business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the 
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Entities (including the Business),
taken as a whole, or (B) the business, operations, financial condition or
results of operations of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, taken as a whole.

 


 

 

(iii) Nothing in _Section 5.5(a)(ii)_ shall obligate the Purchaser or its
Affiliates to agree to any divestitures or other remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the Principal Closing. In no event shall  the Seller or any
of its respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates propose, negotiate, effect or
agree to any divestitures or other remedy without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser. At the request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall agree to 
divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of
the businesses, services or assets of the Transferred Assets and/or the
Transferred Entities; _provided_ that any such action shall be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Principal Closing and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither the Purchaser nor the  Seller shall, nor shall
the Purchaser or the Seller permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to,
acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a 
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the
applicable clearance, approval, consent or waiver from any Governmental
Authority with  respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) The filing fees under Antitrust Laws and all other  applicable Laws shall
be borne by the Purchaser.

 


 

 

 

49  


 

 


 

 

Section 5.6. _Third-Party Consents_.

 


 

 

(a) Prior to the Applicable Closing, the Purchaser and the  Seller shall, and
the Seller shall cause each other member of the Seller Group to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
consents required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement, including all required consents under
Transferred Business Contracts and Transferred Real Property Leases and the
Real Property Subleases, but excluding consents of Governmental Authorities,
which are governed by _Section 5.5_ ; _provided_ that (i) neither the
Purchaser nor any member of the Seller Group shall be  obligated to pay any
consideration to any third party from whom consent is requested, (ii) the
prior written consent of the Purchaser shall be required with respect to any
amendment or modification to any such Contract for the purpose of obtaining 
any such consent that is materially adverse to the Purchaser, the Business or
the Transferred Entities and (iii) obtaining any such consents shall not be a
condition to the Principal Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Purchaser agrees  to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
assurances as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may
be reasonably requested by any third party whose consent is sought hereunder.

 


 

 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months after the  Applicable Closing Date,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause each other
member of the Seller Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any consents, approvals or authorizations of any third parties that are  not
obtained prior to the Applicable Closing Date and that are required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that neither the  Purchaser nor any member of the Seller Group (nor any of
their respective Affiliates) shall be obligated to pay any consideration to
any third party from whom consent is requested.

 


 

 

(c) Prior to the Applicable Closing, the Seller shall use  commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) Contracts entered into by Transferred Entities
to not include a change in control provision in favor of the other party or
parties thereto to the extent such provision does not carve out the
transactions  contemplated hereby or (ii) Contracts primarily relating to the
Business and entered into by a member of the Seller Group that is not a
Transferred Entity to not include an anti-assignment provision requiring
consent or approval to effect the  assignment (or partial assignment, as
applicable) of such Contract in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 


 

 

Section 5.7. _Split Contracts; Enterprise-Wide Contracts_.

 


 

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Applicable Closing,  upon the Seller's or
the Purchaser's reasonable request, with respect to any Split Contract, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall use, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (including, after the Applicable Closing Date, the Transferred 
Entities) to use, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the counterparty to
such Split Contract to (i) enter into or grant a new contract with (x) if any
member of the Seller Group (other than the Transferred Entities) is party to
the Split  Contract, the Purchaser or any designee of the Purchaser or (y) if
any Transferred Entity (and no member of the Seller Group) is party to the
Split Contract, the Seller or any designee of the Seller, on terms
substantially similar in all material  respects to those contained in such
Split Contract, in order for the Business and the other businesses of the
Seller Group to receive the applicable claims, rights and benefits and bear
the applicable burdens and obligations under such Split  Contract (each such
new contract, a " _New_

 


 

 

 

50  


 

 


 

 

_Contract_ "), it being understood that a New Contract will not necessarily
contain the same  terms as the Split Contract to which it relates, or (ii) if
practicable, and (subject to any required third-party consents or notices and
any restrictions imposed by applicable Law), assign to (x) if any member of
the Seller Group (other than the  Transferred Entities) is party to the Split
Contract, the Purchaser or any designee of the Purchaser the claims, rights,
benefits, burdens and obligations under such Split Contract to the extent
relating to the Business or (y) if any Transferred  Entity (and no member of
the Seller Group) is party to the Split Contract, the Seller or any designee
of the Seller the claims, rights, benefits, burdens and obligations under such
Split Contract to the extent not relating to the Business; _provided_ that no
party to such Split Contract shall be required to assign any such claims,
rights, benefits, burdens and obligations under any Split Contract if doing so
could  adversely affect its rights thereunder (other than those rights which
are the subject of such assignment). In connection with the entering into of
New Contracts, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to  use, reasonable best efforts to ensure that (x)
each member of the Seller Group and its Affiliates are released by such
counterparty with respect to all liabilities and obligations relating to the
Business and (y) each Transferred Entity is released  by such counterparty
with respect to all liabilities and obligations not relating to the Business.

 


 

 

(b) If, prior to the Applicable Closing Date, the parties  are not able, with
respect to any such Split Contract, to obtain a New Contract in respect of
such Split Contract or to assign to, as applicable (x) the Purchaser or its
designee the claims, rights, benefits, burdens and obligations of such Split 
Contract to the extent relating to the Business or (y) the Seller or its
designee the claims, rights, benefits, burdens and obligations of such Split
Contract to the extent not relating to the Business, then for a period of nine
(9) months  following the Applicable Closing: (i) the Seller and the
Purchaser shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
counterparty to enter into such a New Contract or so assign such benefits and
obligations under such Split  Contract, (ii) with respect to customer
Contracts that are Split Contracts, the Seller and the Purchaser shall enter
into a subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement, as applicable,
governing the parties' relative obligations under  such Split Contract, (iii)
the Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, shall, or shall cause its designee
to, bear the costs and liabilities under such Split Contract from and after
the Applicable Closing to the extent that the Purchaser or the  Seller or its
designee receives the rights and benefits of such Split Contract and (iv)
until such time as such a New Contract is executed or such claims, rights,
benefits, burdens and obligations under such Split Contract are so assigned,
the  Purchaser and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
secure an alternative arrangement reasonably satisfactory to both parties
under which the Business or the other businesses of the Seller Group would, in
compliance with  applicable Law, obtain the benefits and bear the burdens
associated with the applicable Split Contract such that the Business or the
other businesses of the Seller Group would be placed in a substantially
similar position as if such a New Contract  had been executed or such
benefits and obligations had been so assigned. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, shall, or shall cause
its designee to, promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any liability 
arising under any Split Contract from and after the Principal Closing Date to
the extent that such liability relates to rights and benefits under such Split
Contract that the Purchaser or the Seller (or their respective designee)
receives pursuant  to this _Section 5.7(b)_.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, (i) neither
the Purchaser nor any member of the Seller Group shall have any obligation
under this _Section 5.7_

 


 

 

 

51  


 

 


 

 

following the date that is nine (9) months after the Applicable Closing Date,
and (ii) neither the Purchaser nor any member of the Seller Group shall be
required to make  any expenditure or incur or assume any liability of, in the
case of the Purchaser, the Seller's businesses, or in the case of the Seller,
the Business in connection with any such activities described in this _Section
5.7_ , other than immaterial administrative or legal costs and expenses,
unless reimbursed and/or fully indemnified by the Seller or the Purchaser, as
applicable, for the full amount of any such  expenditure or liability. Each
party acknowledges that the other (including its respective Affiliates) shall
not have any liability or obligation with respect to any New Contract (other
than the efforts expressly required by this _Section 5.7_ ) or failure to
obtain any New Contract.

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, the Seller
shall have no obligation under this _Section 5.7_ with respect to Enterprise-
Wide Contracts and shall have no obligation to cause the counterparty to  any
Enterprise-Wide Contract to enter into a New Contract with the Purchaser or
any designee of the Purchaser, or assign in whole or in part to the Purchaser
or any designee of the Purchaser the benefits and obligations under such
Enterprise-Wide  Contract relating to the Business or to enter into any
subcontracting or other arrangements with respect to Enterprise-Wide
Contracts.

 


 

 

Section 5.8. _Further Action; Accounts Payable; Payments Made_.

 


 

 

(a) From time to time after the Applicable Closing Date,  and for no further
consideration, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, with respect to the Purchaser after the Applicable
Closing Date, the Transferred Entities) to, execute, acknowledge and deliver,
or  cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered, such assignments,
transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents and instruments and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to appropriately consummate
the transactions  contemplated hereby, including (i) transferring back to the
Seller (or applicable member or designee of the Seller Group) any asset or
Liability that was not contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to the
Purchaser at the Applicable  Closing but was so transferred at the Applicable
Closing and (ii) transferring to the Purchaser any asset or Liability
contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to the Purchaser that was not
so transferred at the Applicable Closing.

 


 

 

(b) In the event that any member of the Seller Group or  any of its
Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities)
pays, on or after the Applicable Closing Date, any account payable or other
amount that constitutes an Assumed Liability, such member of the Seller Group
or  Affiliate shall be reimbursed and/or indemnified and held harmless by the
Purchaser in full for such payment, as provided in _Article VIII_.

 


 

 

(c) In the event that the Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Entities) pays, on or after the
Applicable Closing Date, any account payable or other amount that constitutes
an Excluded Liability, such Person shall be reimbursed and/or  indemnified
and held harmless by the Seller in full for such payment, as provided in
_Article VIII_.

 


 

 

(d) The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the  other hand, agree
that, after the Applicable Closing Date, they shall hold and shall promptly
transfer and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser (or its
designee) or the Seller (or its designee), as applicable, from time

 


 

 

 

52  


 

 


 

 

to time as and when received by either of them or their respective Affiliates,
any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using commercially reasonable
efforts not  to convert such checks into cash), or other property that either
of them may receive after the Applicable Closing Date which property belongs
to the other party or any of its Affiliates (which, in the case of the Seller,
for purposes of this _Section 5.8(d)_ , shall include entities and businesses
previously divested by the Seller Group), including any payments of accounts
receivable, and shall account to the other  party (including, to a designee
of such party) for all such receipts. In the event of a dispute between the
parties regarding the Seller's or the Purchaser's obligations under this
_Section   5.8(d)_ , the parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to
promptly resolve such dispute and, in connection with such cooperation and
subject to _Section 5.4_ ,  allow each other (including a designee of such
other) reasonable access to the records of the other relating to such disputed
item.

 


 

 

Section 5.9. _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such expenses.

 


 

 

Section 5.10. _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 


 

 

(a) _Business Employee List_. _Section 5.10(a)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedules
lists, after consultation with the Purchaser, each Business Employee as  of
the date hereof (the " _Business Employee List_ "), including, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, an identification number and such Business
Employee's name,  position, work location, employing entity, base salary or
wages, target bonus, pension eligibility and employment status (i.e., part-
time or full-time, exempt or non-exempt). The Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser an update to the Business  Employee List at least thirty (30) days
prior to the Principal Closing Date. With respect to each Deferred
Jurisdiction, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser an update to the
Business Employee List at least 10 days prior to the anticipated  Applicable
Closing Date. Any changes to the Business Employee List following the date
hereof shall be mutually agreed to by the Purchaser and the Seller on or prior
to the Principal Closing Date and/or Applicable Closing Date, as applicable;
_provided_ that such agreement of either party shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall not be required in the event of
terminations of employment  due to death, disability, resignation,
retirement, as otherwise permitted by Section 5.1(d)(iii) of this Agreement or
in the case of any Automatic Transferred Employee. Except in accordance with
this _Section 5.10(a)_ , the Seller shall take all reasonable actions to
ensure that Business Employees are not transferred to or from the Business
following the date hereof.

 


 

 

(b) _Continuation of Employment_.

 


 

 

(i) Where applicable Law provides for  the automatic transfer of employment
of any Business Employee upon the consummation of the Applicable Closing, the
parties (A) shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are required under
applicable Law to accomplish such transfer of  employment of such Business
Employee to the Purchaser by operation of Law as of the Applicable Closing and
(B) shall not take and shall not cause to be taken any such actions that would
result in the employment of such Business Employee not  transferring to the
Purchaser by operation of Law as of the Applicable Closing. Where applicable
Law does not provide for the automatic transfer of employment of any Business

 


 

 

 

53  


 

 


 

 

Employee upon the consummation of the Applicable Closing, the Purchaser shall
make or cause an Affiliate to make offers of employment to such Business 
Employee (which offers may be of at-will employment to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 5.10_ ,
except as otherwise  provided in this _Section 5.10_ , to be effective as of
the Applicable Closing.

 


 

 

(ii) The parties acknowledge that the  transfer of the portions of the
Business conducted by the Seller Group in the European Union (" _EU_ ") and
certain other countries constitutes a transfer of business within  the
meaning of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC, the national Laws implementing the
same or any similar Laws applicable in non-EU jurisdictions, and each Business
Employee with respect to such portions of the Business shall be referred to
herein as  a " _European Employee_ ". Subject to _Section 5.10(b)(iii)_
below, the parties further  acknowledge that, as a result, the employment of
the European Employees, including all related rights and obligations, will
transfer by operation of Law to the Purchaser, as applicable, as of the
Applicable Closing, except with respect to any  European Employee who timely
exercises his or her rights, if any, under any applicable Law to prevent such
transfer from occurring. Each European Employee or other Business Employee
whose employment transfers automatically to the Purchaser by  operation of
Law, together with each other Business Employee of any Transferred Entity, is
referred to herein as an " _Automatic Transferred Employee_ ". The Purchaser
or its  applicable Affiliate will assume by operation of Law, as of the
Applicable Closing Date, all Liabilities with respect to the Automatic
Transferred Employees except to the extent otherwise provided in this _Section
5.10_.

 


 

 

(iii) The parties will use their  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the approval of the applicable Governmental Authority or any labor authority
as may be required for the transfer of the Automatic Transferred Employees, if
any, who are "protected employees" under  applicable Law; provided that this
_Section 5.10(b)(iii)_ shall not apply to matters concerning Employee
Representatives, which are addressed in Section 5.10(q). If any  Business
Employee requires a work permit or employment pass or other legal or
regulatory approval for his or her employment with the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
permit, pass or other  approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the
Applicable Closing Date. In the event any such permit, pass or other approval
is not obtained and in effect prior to the Applicable Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall use its commercially  reasonable efforts to cause any such
permit, pass or other approval to be obtained as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter.

 


 

 

(c) _Offers of Employment_. Each Business Employee (other than Business
Employees who are on long-term disability) who is not an Automatic Transferred
Employee is referred to herein as an " _Offer Employee_ ". The Purchaser shall
make, or shall cause an Affiliate to make, an offer of employment to such
Offer Employee (which offer may be of at-will employment to the extent
permitted by  applicable Law), at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Applicable Closing Date (or such longer period required by applicable Law, the
terms of any applicable Labor Contract or the Severance Obligations), with
such employment to be effective as of  the Applicable Closing Date. Any such
offer of employment shall (i) comply with applicable Law, any applicable Labor
Contract and this _Section 5.10_ and (ii) provide for  such terms and
conditions of employment which, in the case of each Business Employee, are
sufficient to avoid Severance Obligations. Each such

 


 

 

 

54  


 

 


 

 

Offer Employee who accepts such offer of employment from (and commences
employment with) the Purchaser, collectively with each Automatic Transferred
Employee, is referred  to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ". Except as
otherwise specifically provided in this _Section 5.10_ or to the extent
required by applicable Law, effective as of the Applicable Closing Date (or
such later date on which a Transferred Employee commences employment with the
Purchaser), the Transferred Employees shall cease (x) all active
participation  in and accrual of benefits under the Business Benefit Plans,
other than the Assumed Benefit Plans and (y) receiving payment of their wages
from the Seller Group. If and to the extent that any Business Employee who is
on long-term disability as of  the Applicable Closing Date but who would
otherwise have been an Offer Employee is able to return to active employment
within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Applicable Closing Date (or
any such longer period, if required by applicable  Law), the Purchaser shall
make such Business Employee an offer of employment as provided above and, if
accepted, such Business Employee will become a Transferred Employee from and
after the date that his or her employment with the Purchaser  commences as
provided in such offer.

 


 

 

(d) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits._ For a period of twelve (12)
months immediately after the Applicable Closing Date (or for such longer
period as required by applicable Law), the Purchaser shall provide to each 
Transferred Employee (i) a base salary or base wages (including, in the case
of persons receiving commission based income, the rate of commissions) and
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less
favorable in the aggregate  than those provided to such Transferred Employee
as in effect immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date, (ii) other
employee benefits (excluding, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, long-
term incentive and equity compensation, defined  benefit retirement benefits,
retiree life and retiree medical benefits, change in control or other
transaction related payments and benefits and other post-employment benefits
or deferred compensation) that are substantially comparable in the  aggregate
to those provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries and (iii) any other additional terms and conditions of employment
required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation
and  benefits of Transferred Employees who are covered by a Labor Contract
shall be provided in accordance with the applicable Labor Contract. Except to
the extent otherwise provided in a Labor Contract or at applicable Law,
nothing contemplated by  this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the
Purchaser to be obligated to continue the employment of any Transferred
Employee for any period after the Applicable Closing Date; _provided_   that
the Purchaser shall provide such Transferred Employee with pay and benefits to
the extent required pursuant to _Section 5.10(e)_.

 


 

 

(e) _Severance Obligations_.

 


 

 

(i) The parties intend that the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance of employment of
any Business Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the Applicable
Closing and that the Business Employees will have  continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
Applicable Closing Date, and the parties shall comply with any requirements
under applicable Law to ensure the same. The Seller shall bear any costs
related to  (to the extent not included as a Transaction Expense), and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against, any claims made by
any Business Employee for any Severance Obligations, in each case, arising out
of, relating to or in  connection with any of the following: (A) a Business
Employee's refusal to accept an offer

 


 

 

 

55  


 

 


 

 

of employment that complies with the terms of this Agreement from, or
rejection of any automatic transfer of employment to, the Purchaser or any
of  its Subsidiaries, (B) any Transferred Employee's transfer (automatic or
otherwise) of employment to or continuation of employment with the Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries upon the Applicable Closing Date or (C) any action
taken on or prior to  the Applicable Closing Date by the Seller Group (other
than any such action the Seller Group takes on behalf or at the direction of
the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment of any Business
Employee or which provides such  Business Employee a right to terminate
employment, including in the case of this clause (C), any action or omission
by the Seller Group (1) to amend or otherwise modify on or prior to the
Applicable Closing Date any terms and conditions of employment  applicable
to, or compensation and benefits provided to, any Transferred Employee or (2)
that does not comply with applicable Law or the terms of any Business Benefit
Plan or applicable Labor Contract. The Purchaser shall bear any costs related
to,  and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller from and against, any
claims made by any Business Employee for any Severance Obligations, in each
case, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any of the following:
(x) the failure of the  Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to make offers
of employment to, or continue the employment of, any Business Employee in
accordance with this Agreement or as required by applicable Law or a Labor
Contract or (y) any action taken on or after the  Applicable Closing Date by
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Business Employee or which provides such Business Employee a right to
terminate employment, including in the case of this clause (y), any action
or  omission by the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (1) to amend or
otherwise modify on or after the Applicable Closing Date any terms and
conditions of employment applicable to, or compensation and benefits provide
to, any Business Employee or (2)  that does not comply with applicable Law or
the terms of any Assumed Benefit Plan or applicable Labor Contract.

 


 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 5.10(d)_ , the Purchaser shall provide each
Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated within twelve (12) months
following the Applicable Closing Date (or  within such longer period as
required by applicable Law) with severance and other separation benefits which
such Transferred Employee would have been eligible to receive under the
Business Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the  Applicable
Closing Date and set forth on _Section 5.10(e)(i)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules; _provided_   that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such
severance and other separation benefits shall be provided only if the
Transferred Employee timely executes (and does not revoke) a release of claims
in favor of both the Seller and the Purchaser  in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the parties.

 


 

 

(f) _Prior Service Credit_. From and after the Applicable Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including any Transferred
Entity) to, give to each Transferred Employee full credit for all purposes 
(including for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vacation accrual and other paid time off, severance or separation
entitlements, long-service pay, vesting and benefit accrual) under any
employee benefit plan or arrangement  provided, maintained or contributed to
by the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Entities) for such Transferred Employee's service with the Seller Group, and
with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized  by the Seller
Group immediately prior to the Applicable Closing Date, except to the extent
such credit would result in

 


 

 

 

56  


 

 


 

 

the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent permitted under any applicable Law, the Purchaser
and its  Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) shall not be
required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual purposes under
any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred  Entities) that is a defined benefit pension plan,
unless such plan is an Assumed Benefit Plan, or which would result in a
duplication of any benefit otherwise provided under a Business Benefit Plan.

 


 

 

(g) _Assumption of Liabilities_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this _Section 5.10_ , from and after the Applicable Closing Date, the 
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) shall
assume (and the Seller Group shall not retain) all employment and employee
Liabilities arising out of or relating to the operation or conduct of the
Business prior to, on or  following the Applicable Closing Date in the case
of (i) all Transferred Employees and (ii) all Former Employees who were
employed by any Transferred Entity. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this _Section 5.10_ , from and after the Principal Closing Date, the Seller
Group shall retain (and the Purchaser shall not assume) all employment and
employee Liabilities arising out of or relating to the operation or  conduct
of the Business prior to, on or following the Principal Closing Date in the
case of (x) all Former Employees who were not employed by any Transferred
Entity and (y) all Business Employees who do not become Transferred Employees.
  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller
Group shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify the Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) in relation to all

Disclosure  Schedules (" _Transferred Pension Liabilities_ "), (I) from and
after the Applicable Closing Date, the Seller Group shall retain all assets
and Liabilities under tax-qualified  and nonqualified defined benefit and

other similar U.S. state or local Law or regulation, in each case with respect
to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group
termination or similar event affecting Transferred Employees and occurring
after the  Applicable Closing. None of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
shall take any action after the Applicable Closing that would cause any
termination of employment of any Business Employees that occurs before the
Effective Time of the Applicable  Closing to create any liability or penalty
to any member of the Seller Group in connection with a "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" or group termination under the WARN Act or any similar U.S.
state or local Law. The Seller shall provide to Purchaser  at the Principal
Closing a complete and accurate list of all "employment losses" within the

ninety  (90) calendar days preceding the Principal Closing.

 


 

 

(q) _Employee Consultations_. The Seller and its Subsidiaries shall fully
comply with all of their respective obligations (however arising) to inform
and/or consult with, or obtain the advice and consent or approval of, and in 
respect of, the Business Employees or any Employee Representative, whether the
same arises under any Labor Contract or applicable Law. The Purchaser shall
take such steps as are required by applicable Law or otherwise reasonably
requested by the  Seller to facilitate compliance by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries with their obligations to inform and consult or obtain the advice
and consent or approval of any Business Employees or Employee Representative.

respect to the Seller's or its Affiliates' operations in Germany results in an
operational change ("Betriebsanderung") in the meaning of the German Works
Constitution Act ("Betriebsverfassungsgesetz"), the Seller  shall negotiate a
reconciliation of interest and social plan with the competent works council to
the extent necessary. The conclusion of such reconciliation of interest and
social plan is subject to the prior written consent of the Purchaser. The 
Seller shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed on the status of such
negotiations and shall allow Purchaser to participate in such negotiations
(e.g., by way of joining meetings with the competent parties).

 


 

 

 

61  


 

 


 

 

(r) _Administration._ Following the date hereof and subject to applicable Law,
the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in all matters reasonably
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 5.10_ ,
including exchanging information and data relating to workers' compensation,
employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages (except to the extent 
prohibited by applicable Law) and encouraging the Business Employees to accept
the Purchaser's offers of employment made pursuant to _Section 5.10(b)(iii)_.

 


 

 

(s) _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ No provision of this _Section 5.10_ shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former  employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of any member of the Seller
Group (including the Transferred Entities). Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the Purchaser and
its  Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee at any time and for any reason, (ii)
require the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to continue any employee benefit
plans or arrangements,  including any Assumed Benefit Plan, or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Applicable Closing
Date or (iii) amend any Business Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plans
or arrangements.

 


 

 

Section 5.11. _French Put Option_.

 


 

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,  this Agreement
shall not constitute a binding agreement to sell or purchase the French
Business until the French Put Option is exercised.

 


 

 

(b) In the event that the French Put Option is exercised on  or prior to the
Principal Closing, this _Section 5.11_ shall terminate and shall cease to have
effect with respect to the French Business.

 


 

 

(c) In the event that the French Put Option is not  exercised on or prior to
the Principal Closing:

 


 

 

(i) The Disapplied Provisions shall not  apply to the French Business at the
Principal Closing;

 


 

 

(ii) in respect of the Disapplied  Provisions, (A) the term "Business" shall
be deemed to exclude the French Business, (B) the term "Transferred Employees"
shall be deemed to exclude the applicable French Put Option Employees; and (C)
the term "Transferred Entities" shall exclude  Pitney Bowes Software S.A.S.,
in each case, as of the Principal Closing;

 


 

 

(iii) the Closing Purchase Price to be paid  at the Principal Closing shall
be reduced by the amount of the Closing Purchase Price attributable to the
French Business to be reasonably agreed by the parties hereto (the " _Put 
Option Price_ ");

 


 

 

(iv) the Estimated Adjustment Amount and  the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
shall take into account the exclusions referred to in _Section 5.11(c)(ii)_
and the Target Working Capital for purposes of the purchase  price adjustment
as of the Principal Closing shall be reduced by an amount of the Target
Working Capital attributable to the French

 


 

 

 

62  


 

 


 

 

Business to be reasonably agreed by the parties hereto (collectively, the "
_French  Put Option NWC Changes_ "); and

 


 

 

(v) upon exercise by the Seller of the  French Put Option prior to the Expiry
Date, the Purchaser shall purchase the French Business at a price equal to the
Put Option Price (as adjusted in accordance with the paragraph following this
paragraph), and on the same terms and conditions as  would have been provided
if the Seller had exercised the French Put Option on or prior to the Principal
Closing (including the application of the Disapplied Provisions and the
reversion of the French Put Option NWC Changes) and the closing of the 
transfer of the French Business will be effected on the first (1st) day of the
month immediately following the date the Seller exercises the French Put
Option (the " _French Closing_ ");    _provided_ that, if such day is not a
Business Day in France, then the French Closing shall take place on the first
(1st) Business Day thereafter (such date, the " _French Closing Date_ "),
though the French Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m., France
time, on the first (1st) day of the month.

 


 

 

_Section 1.07_ and _Section 1.08_ and apply mutatis mutandis for the Put
Option Price, with the "French Business" substituting for  the "Business",
Pitney Bowes Software S.A.S. substituting for "Transferred Entities" and the
"French Closing" substituting for the "Principal Closing" in the definitions
of "Current Assets", "Current Liabilities", "Closing Cash" and "Transferring 
Indebtedness", and the Target Working Capital for the Put Option Price
adjustment shall be an amount to be reasonably agreed by the parties hereto.

 


 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the French Put Option is not
exercised prior to the Principal Closing, France and the  French Closing
shall not constitute a Deferred Jurisdiction and a Deferred Closing,
respectively, and the French Business shall not be part of the Deferred
Business.

 


 

 

(d) _French Put Option Terms_.

 


 

 

(i) The French Put Option will enter  into force at the date hereof. The
Seller hereby accepts the benefit of the French Put Option and may, at its own
discretion and option, elect to exercise the French Put Option in accordance
with the procedures set forth herein, without having the  Seller being
committed to sell to the Purchaser the French Business. The Seller shall only
be entitled to exercise the French Put Option for all (and not a portion) of
the French Business. The French Put Option may be exercised by the Seller at 
any time, after the date upon which the notification and information processes
to the French Put Option Employees (the " _Notification and Information
Processes_ ") required  under applicable Laws in France in connection with
the sale of the French Business have been completed, until the Expiry Date, by
sending to Purchaser a notice, in the form set forth in _Section 5.11(d)(i)_
of the Disclosure Schedules.

 


 

 

(ii) Upon the election of the Seller, the  Purchaser hereby promises and
undertakes to purchase and assume from the Seller Group all (and not a
portion) of the French Transferred Equity Interests in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement (the " _French
Put Option_ "), it being understood that, for the sake of clarity, if the
French Put Option is exercised prior to the Principal Closing,

 


 

 

 

63  


 

 


 

 

Pitney Bowes Software S.A.S. shall be deemed a Transferred Entity and the
purchase price for the French Transferred Equity Interests shall be  included
in the computation of the Purchase Price.

 


 

 

(iii) As soon as practicable, the Seller  will cause the relevant member of
the Seller Group to initiate the Notification and Information Processes and to
promptly pursue the delivery of written waivers from the French Put Option
Employees with respect to the full extent of their rights to  make an offer
for the French Business.

 


 

 

(iv) The parties shall keep each other  regularly informed of the status of
each these processes and provide to the other party a copy of the written
waivers from the French Put Option Employees as soon as possible after
obtaining them.

 


 

 

(v) The French Put Option shall  automatically terminate on the earlier of (
_i_ ) the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is sixty (60) Business Days
after the conclusion of the Notification and  Information Processes (the "
_Expiry Date_ "), unless the French Put Option is exercised on or prior to
such date.

 


 

 

(vi) The Seller agrees that it shall not  directly or indirectly sell or
commit to sell the French Transferred Equity Interests so long as the French
Put Option remains outstanding.

 


 

 

Section 5.12. _Intercompany Accounts; Affiliate Agreements_.

 


 

 

(a) Prior to the Principal Closing, the Seller shall cause  any amounts owed
to or by any member of the Seller Group or Affiliate thereof (other than the
Transferred Entities), on the one hand, from or to any of the Transferred
Entities, on the other hand (other than (i) pursuant to, or in accordance
with,  the Transaction Documents and (ii) amounts owed to or by any
Transferred Entity, on the one hand, from or to any other Transferred Entity,
on the other hand), to be canceled, settled or otherwise discharged (either
(x) consistent with _Section 5.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules or (y)
otherwise in a manner which is reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser) without
any further or continuing Liability on the  part of any Transferred Entity.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to the Principal Closing, the Seller may cause  any amounts owed to
or by any Transferred Entity, on the one hand, from or to any other
Transferred Entity, on the other hand, to be canceled, settled or otherwise
discharged (either (x) consistent with _Section 5.12(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules or (y) otherwise in a manner which is reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser).

 


 

 

(c) The Seller shall cause all Affiliate Agreements or  Contracts entered
into after the date hereof that would be Affiliate Agreements if entered into
as of the date hereof, other than the Transition Services Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, to be settled or terminated prior to the 
Principal Closing without any further or continuing Liability on the part of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any Transferred Entity, other than
as set forth on _Section  5.12(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

 


 

 

 

64  


 

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  this _Section
5.12_ , the actions required to be taken at the Principal Closing pursuant to
this _Section  5.12_ with respect to the French Business shall not be
required to be taken until the French Put Option is exercised.

 


 

 

Section 5.13. _Seller Marks_. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not directly or indirectly use, in any
fashion, including in signage, corporate letterhead, business cards, internet
websites,  marketing material and the like, and shall not register or own or
seek to register or own, in connection with any products or services anywhere
in the world in any medium, any trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade
names, trade dress, trade  styles or other indicia of origin (collectively, "
_Marks_ ") that include, are identical to or are confusingly similar to any
Marks that constitute Excluded Intellectual  Property (including any
corporate symbols or logos to the extent incorporating the Marks set forth on
_Section 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedules) (collectively, the " _Seller
Marks_ "), nor shall any of them challenge or oppose or assist any third party
in challenging or opposing the rights of any member of the Seller Group
anywhere in the  world in any of the Seller Marks. Subject to the
restrictions set forth herein, the Seller hereby extends, on behalf of itself
and the other members of the Seller Group, to the Purchaser and the
Transferred Entities effective as of the Principal  Closing Date, a personal,
nonexclusive, royalty-free transition license to continue to use the Seller
Marks: for one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Principal Closing Date
on existing signage, products and other materials in any media, in  each case
included in the Transferred Assets or owned by the Transferred Entities as of
the Principal Closing Date. Except as permitted under this _Section 5.13_ , no
use  of the Seller Marks shall be made by the Purchaser or its Affiliates and
the Purchaser shall in any event transition away from all use of the Seller
Marks as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Principal Closing Date.
For clarity, the  Purchaser and the Transferred Entities have no obligation
to remove the Seller Marks from items no longer in their possession or
control. The Purchaser shall ensure that the quality of all goods and services
offered or sold under any of the Seller  Marks shall be at least as high as
the quality maintained by the members of the Seller Group and their respective
Affiliates for such goods and services as of the Principal Closing and, at the
Seller's request, shall provide the Seller with samples  of its use of the
Seller Marks to permit the Seller to confirm the Purchaser's compliance with
the quality control requirements of this sentence. All use of the Seller Marks
as permitted hereunder shall inure solely to the benefit of the Seller 
Group. The Purchaser shall incur all costs associated with re-branding of the
Transferred Assets with signage, symbols and marks not constituting the Seller
Marks, which re-branding shall be completed at the expiration of the term of
the one  hundred and eighty (180)-day transition license granted under this
_Section 5.13_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller agrees that the
Purchaser and its Affiliates  have the right, at all times after the
Principal Closing Date, to use the Seller Marks (i) to the extent required by
applicable Law, (ii) in a neutral, non-trademark manner to describe the
history of the Business, (iii) on internal office supplies  (e.g., pens,
cups, notepads) and software that are not visible to the public until their
replacement in the ordinary course of business, and (iv) on historical legal
and business agreements and documents. For a maximum of one (1) year after
the  Principal Closing, at the Purchaser's request, the Seller Group shall
display in mutually-agreed locations on their websites and in social media, in
the locations previously addressing the Business, a mutually-agreed statement
about the  transactions contemplated hereby and a link to websites and other
social media venues reasonably designated by the Purchaser.

 


 

 

Section 5.14. _Insurance_. The Purchaser acknowledges that coverage for the
Transferred Entities or the Business under the insurance policies of the
Seller Group (the " _Seller Insurance_ ")

 


 

 

 

65  


 

 


 

 

will no longer exist as of the Principal Closing with respect to claims
arising from events that occur or are alleged to have occurred after the
Principal Closing Date  and that the Seller will not purchase any "tail"
policy or other additional or substitute coverage for the benefit of the
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with the Purchaser on any claim for coverage by  or on behalf of
the Transferred Entities or the Purchaser with respect to the Transferred
Entities or the Business under the Seller Insurance with respect to claims
arising from events that occurred or were alleged to have occurred prior to
the  Principal Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Occurrences_ "); _provided_ that,
to the extent coverage for  any such claim is also available under any
insurance policies of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, the Purchaser shall
also submit claims under such policies. Subject to the first sentence of this
_Section 5.14_ , the Seller shall take no action to exclude or remove the
Transferred Entities from coverage that may be available under any such Seller
Insurance with respect to Pre-Closing Occurrences. The Seller shall 
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in and use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue the collection of all insurance proceeds in respect of
claims made by the Purchaser or the Transferred Entities with respect to Pre-
Closing Occurrences. The  Purchaser shall reimburse each member of the Seller
Group for any costs and expenses (including increased premiums) incurred
thereby as a result of such claims and shall exclusively bear (and no member
of the Seller Group shall have any obligation to  repay or reimburse the
Purchaser for) any deductibles, retentions, loss adjustments or uninsured,
uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts relating to or associated with
such claims. This _Section 5.14_ shall not be considered as an attempted
assignment of any policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance, and
nothing in this _Section 5.14_   is intended to waive or abrogate in any way
any member of the Seller Group's rights to insurance coverage for any
liability, whether relating to the Seller or any of its Affiliates or
otherwise.

 


 

 

Section 5.15. _R andW Insurance Policy_. To the extent the Purchaser obtains a
representation and warranty insurance policy in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_"), the
Purchaser shall not waive, amend or modify the RandW Insurance Policy in a
manner adverse to the Seller without the prior written consent of the Seller
(such consent  not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the following amendments shall
not be deemed adverse to the Seller  and shall not require consent of the
Seller: (i) amendments that are clerical in nature or are intended to correct
typographical errors, (ii) amendments to add additional named insureds under
the RandW Insurance Policy, (iii) amendments to  reflect an assignment made in
accordance with the RandW Insurance Policy and (iv) amendments required to
comply with applicable Law (if any). The RandW Insurance Policy shall include a
provision whereby the insurer expressly waives, and agrees  not to pursue,
directly or indirectly, any subrogation rights against any member of the
Seller Group, or any former or current stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives of any member of
the Seller  Group with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder
(except for knowing and intentional fraud in connection with the transaction).

 


 

 

Section 5.16. _Non-Competition_.

 


 

 

(a) The Seller agrees that for the period from the  Principal Closing Date
until the fourth anniversary of the Principal Closing Date, it shall not and
shall cause each other member of the Seller Group not to, directly or
indirectly:

 


 

 

 

66  


 

 


 

 

(i) Engage in a business in any  jurisdiction in which the Business operates
as of immediately prior to the Principal Closing, to the extent such business
competes with the Business, as conducted as of the date hereof or as of the
Principal Closing Date (each, a " _Competitive Activity_ "); or

 


 

 

(ii) Acquire beneficial ownership or  voting control of the outstanding
equity interests (including any debt securities exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into, equity interests) of any Person that is engaged in a
Competitive Activity;

 


 

 

_provided_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit any member of the Seller 
Group from collectively owning up to an aggregate of 5% of the outstanding
shares of any class of capital stock of any Person if such stock is publicly
traded and listed on any national exchange or quoted on the NASDAQ National
Market, regardless of  whether or not such Person is engaging in Competitive
Activity (a " _Competing Person_ ") so long as no member of the Seller Group
has any participation in the management of  such Competing Person.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the  foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 5.16_ shall prohibit any member of the Seller Group from:

 


 

 

(i) acquiring the whole or any part of a  Person or business that engages in
any Competitive Activity; (the " _Acquired Entity_ "); _provided_   that
where such Competitive Activities of such Acquired Entity represent greater
than 15% of the annual revenues as measured for the most recent twelve (12)
month period ending on the date of acquisition of the Acquired Entity by such
member of  the Seller Group, such member of the Seller Group shall divest
such Person, business or portion thereof to the extent engaging in such
Competitive Activity within twelve (12) months after the consummation of such
acquisition (irrespective of  whether the end of such twelve (12)-month
period occurs after the expiration of the non-compete period) at such price
and on such terms as the Seller deems commercially reasonable (but in no event
shall such member of the Seller Group be required  to divest such Competitive
Activity at a loss or be required to discontinue operation of such Competitive
Activity in order to comply with this _Section 5.16_ );

 


 

 

(ii) owning any securities through any  bona fide employee benefit plan of
the Seller Group;

 


 

 

(iii) performing any Competitive Activity  for the benefit of the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates at the direction or request of any of the Purchaser,
its Affiliates or their respective representatives, including the performance
of any Competitive Activity required or contemplated by  this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document; or

 


 

 

(iv) continuing to engage in any  activities or businesses as currently
conducted or as conducted as of the Principal Closing Date by any of the Other
Seller Businesses, and any reasonable expansion of such activities or
businesses (which may include geographic expansion, product  expansion and/or
channel expansion).

 


 

 

(c) The parties agree that the restrictions and  limitations set forth in
this _Section 5.16_ are reasonable, valid in geographical and temporal scope
and in all other respects, enforceable, and essential to protect the  value
of the Business, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Entities.

 


 

 

 

67  


 

 


 

 

If a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any term or
provision contained in _Section   5.16(a)_ or _Section 5.16(b)_ is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or tribunal will have the
power to reduce the scope, duration or  geographic area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of  the
invalid or unenforceable term or provision; _provided_ that any such
reduction, deletion or replacement shall only be to the extent necessary to
render such term or  provision valid and enforceable.

 


 

 

Section 5.17. _Non-Solicitation; No-Hire_.

 


 

 

(a) The Seller agrees that, from and after the Principal  Closing until the
third anniversary of the Principal Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause
each other member of the Seller Group not to, directly or indirectly, hire,
employ, engage or offer employment to, or solicit for  employment, any
Transferred Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply  to (i) solicitations made by job opportunity advertisements and
headhunter searches not specifically targeting Transferred Employees or other
employees of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates engaged in the Business,
(ii) solicitations targeting,  or hiring, employing, engaging or offering
employment to, any employee whose employment with the Purchaser or any of its

employment, engagement or offer, except, in the  case of clause (ii), with
respect to any employee who is a beneficiary of Severance Obligations
hereunder.

 


 

 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that from and after the date of  this Agreement
until the third anniversary of the Principal Closing Date, it shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, hire, employ,
engage or offer employment to, or solicit for employment, any Person who is
an  employee of any member of the Seller Group (other than, following the
Principal Closing, Transferred Employees); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to (i) solicitations made by job opportunity
advertisements and headhunter searches not specifically targeting any
employees of any member of the Seller Group or (ii)  solicitations targeting,
or hiring, employing, engaging or offering employment to, any employee whose
employment by the applicable member of the Seller Group terminated more than
six (6) months prior to such solicitation, hiring, employment,  engagement or
offer.

 


 

 

(c) The parties agree that the restrictions and  limitations set forth in
this _Section 5.17_ are reasonable, valid in geographical and temporal scope
and in all other respects, enforceable, and essential to protect the  value
of the Seller Group and its businesses, the Excluded Assets, the Business, the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Entities. If a court or tribunal of
competent jurisdiction determines that any term or provision contained in
_Section 5.17(a)_ or _Section 5.17(b)_ is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties agree that the court  or tribunal will have the power to reduce the
scope, duration or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and  enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision; _provided_ that any such reduction, deletion or  replacement
shall only be to the extent necessary to render such term or provision valid
and enforceable.

 


 

 

 

68  


 

 


 

 

Section 5.18. _Bulk Sale_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the
Seller and any other member of the Seller Group with the provisions of any so

(a) For a period of six years from and after the last Applicable Closing, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred Entities to, (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, all of the past and present directors and  officers
of the Transferred Entities (in their capacities as such) (collectively, the "
_D andO Indemnified Parties_") against any and all Losses incurred in connection
with any action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such DandO  Indemnified Party is
or was a director or officer of the applicable Transferred Entity or is or was
serving solely at the request of such Transferred Entity as a director or
officer of any other Person whether asserted or claimed before, at or  after
the Principal Closing (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby), and provide advancement of expenses to the
DandO  Indemnified Parties (within ten (10) days of receipt by the Purchaser or
such Transferred Entity from a DandO Indemnified Party of a request therefor),
in all such cases to the greatest extent that such Persons are indemnified or
have the right  to advancement of expenses before the Principal Closing by
such Transferred Entity pursuant to its certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
other comparable organizational documents and indemnification agreements, if
any, in existence before the  Principal Closing and (ii) without limitation
of clause (i), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, include and
cause to be maintained in effect the provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, and indemnification of  and advancement of expenses
to directors and officers contained in the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and other comparable organizational documents of such Transferred
Entity.

 


 

 

(b) The obligations of the Purchaser, and the Transferred Entities under this
_Section 5.19_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so
as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party (including such Person's
successors, heirs and legal representatives) to whom this _Section 5.19_
applies without the written consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Party
(it  being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this
_Section 5.19_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.19_ , and  this _Section 5.19_ shall be enforceable by such DandO Indemnified
Parties and  their respective successors, heirs and legal representatives and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Purchaser and any
Transferred Entity).

 


 

 

(c) If the Purchaser or, following the Principal Closing, any Transferred
Entity, or any of their respective successors or assigns, (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the  continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the  successors and assigns of the Purchaser or such
Transferred Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.19_.

 


 

 

 

69  


 

 


 

 

(d) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.19_ shall
be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other comparable organizational
documents of the applicable Transferred Entity, or under any  applicable
contracts or Laws, and, subject to _Section 5.19(a)_ , the  Purchaser shall,
and shall cause such Transferred Entity to, honor and perform under all
indemnification agreements entered into by such Transferred Entity, as
applicable, as in effect on the date hereof.

consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group (including but not limited to any
Seller Consolidated Group) on or prior to the Applicable Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar 
state, local, or non-U.S. Law), or as a successor or transferee (including
pursuant to the UK Taxation of Capital Gains Act 1992 section 179) as a result
of a transaction occurring prior to the Applicable Closing;

 


 

 

(E) any payments  required to be made by a Transferred Entity pursuant to any

Transferred Entity prior to the Principal Closing other than (x) agreements

than Transfer Taxes); and

 


 

 

(H) any Transfer  Taxes allocated to the Seller pursuant to _Section

_provided_ that the Seller shall not be required to pay or cause to be paid,
or to indemnify  or hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any Taxes
(1) that are described in _Section 5.20(a)(ii)(B)_, (2) to the extent such

(b) _Timing of Tax Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payment required to be
made pursuant to _Section 5.20(a)_ or otherwise pursuant to this _Section

written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than five
(5) days  prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes or other amounts are
required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

 


 

 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Period, (i) Property Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire 
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire  Straddle Period, and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes)
allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be computed as if such
taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Principal Closing Date;
_provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an

71  


 

 


 

 

(including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions)
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-
Closing Straddle Period  in proportion to the number of days in each period;
_provided_ , further, any amount required to be included in income under
Section 951(a) or Section 951A of the Code (or any  analogous or similar
non-U.S. Law) with respect to the Transferred Entities allocable to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period shall be computed as if the taxable year of the
applicable foreign corporation ended on the Principal Closing Date.

 


 

 

(d) _Transfer Taxes and VAT_.

 


 

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to  the contrary, each of the Seller and
the Purchaser shall pay (or otherwise bear) 50% of any transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes or notarial fees
(other than VAT) incurred in connection with the  transactions contemplated
under this Agreement (all such items so incurred are referred to herein
collectively as " _Transfer Taxes_ "); _provided_ that if the Seller or the
Purchaser is required by applicable Law to pay any Transfer Taxes that are to
be borne by the other party pursuant to this _Section 5.20(d)(i)_ , such other
party shall pay such Transfer Taxes and the Seller or the Purchaser, as
applicable, shall promptly reimburse such other party for such payment;
_provided_ , further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall
pay (or other otherwise bear) 100% of any Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the Reorganization. The parties  will use commercially
reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate to the extent permitted by Law the
amount of Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement. If either Seller or Purchaser receives
any  refund, credit or recovery of any Transfer Tax that was shared by the
parties in accordance with this _Section 5.20(d)(i)_ , such party shall
promptly pay to the other party  such other party's share of such refund,
credit or recovery, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

 


 

 

(ii) All necessary Tax Returns and other  documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the Purchaser; _provided_ that the
Seller will reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in the  preparation,
execution and filing of any such Tax Returns and other documentation as
necessary.

 


 

 

(iii) The parties agree that the Purchase  Price payable and subject to
adjustment as set forth in _Section 1.5_ and _Section 1.8_ is  exclusive of
any VAT chargeable thereon and any such VAT will be borne equally by the
Purchaser and the Seller; _provided_ that such VAT will be borne solely by
the  Purchaser if such VAT is recoverable by the Purchaser. The parties will
use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate to the extent
permitted by Law the amount of such VAT, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to treat  any applicable transfers as transfers of going
concern and to register for VAT purposes in the applicable jurisdiction
imposing such VAT to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 


 

 

(e) _Tax Returns_.

 


 

 

(i) The Seller shall prepare or shall  cause to be prepared (A) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), on the one hand, and the
Transferred Entities, on the other

hand (a " _Combined Tax Return_ ") and (B) any Tax Return (other than any 
Combined Tax Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to the
Transferred Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Return_ "). All  Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Transferred Entity except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. The Seller shall timely file or cause to
be timely filed any Combined Tax  Return and any Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Return that is required to be filed on or before the Principal Closing Date
(taking into account any extensions). The Seller shall deliver, or cause to be

required to be filed after the Principal Closing Date at least thirty (30)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account
any extensions) and the Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely 
filed such Tax Returns. The Seller shall permit the Purchaser to review and
comment on each Tax Return described in the immediately preceding sentence and
shall consider in good faith any comments received from the Purchaser not
later than ten (10)  days after the Purchaser's receipt of such Tax Return.
Unless required by applicable Law, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the date of the Applicable Closing, the Transferred
Entities) shall not amend or revoke any  Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns
filed in accordance with this _Section 5.20(e)_ without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

(ii) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Except for any Tax Return required to be
prepared by the Seller Group pursuant to _Section 5.20(e)(i)_ ,  the
Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or that include the Transferred
Entities. In the case of any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period (a "
_Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ "), the Purchaser shall prepare or cause
to be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practices of
the Transferred  Entities, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review, comment and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) a
copy of such Straddle Period  Separate Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions) (or as soon
as reasonably practicable in the case of any Straddle Period Separate Tax
Returns due within thirty (30) days of the  Principal Closing Date). The
Purchaser shall revise such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to reflect any
reasonable comments received from Seller not later than fifteen (15) days
before the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions)  (or as soon
as reasonably practicable in the case of any Straddle Period Separate Tax
Returns due within thirty (30) days of the Principal Closing Date); _provided_
, that  the Purchaser shall not file such Straddle Period Tax Separate Return
without the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

(iii) _Purchaser Tax Returns_. The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns (other than Straddle
Period Separate Tax Returns, Combined Tax Returns  and Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Returns) that are required to be filed by or that include the Transferred
Entities (the " _Purchaser Tax Returns_ "). If any such Purchaser Tax  Return
reflects a material item for which the Seller would have an indemnity
obligation under Section 5.20(a) (such material item, a " _Seller Tax Item_
"), the Purchaser  shall (x) deliver to the Seller a draft calculation of
such Seller Tax Item no later

 


 

 

 

73  


 

 


 

 

than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of the applicable Purchaser Tax
Return and (y) reflect any reasonable comments of the Seller with respect  to
such calculation received within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such draft
calculation in preparing such Purchaser Tax Return.

 


 

 

(iv) _Transition Services Agreement_. The parties acknowledge that the Seller
will prepare and file certain Tax Returns related to the Transferred Entities,
the Business and the Transferred Assets  (including certain Straddle Period
Separate Tax Returns) pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

 


 

 

(f) _Tax Cooperation_.

 


 

 

(i) The Purchaser and the Seller shall,  and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives
to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return
or claim for refund, the determination of any Tax liability  or
indemnification obligation, and the preparation, defense and conduct of any
audit, investigation or other Tax Proceeding or otherwise with respect to the
Taxes of the Transferred Entities or with respect to the Business. Such
cooperation shall  include furnishing to each other, upon request, such
information (including access to Tax Returns, books, records and employees)
and assistance as is reasonably requested in connection with any such Tax
Return, refund, determination, audit,  investigation or Tax Proceeding.

 


 

 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this  Agreement, the party requesting
assistance pursuant to this _Section 5.20(f)_ shall reimburse the other party
for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing  any Tax Return,
document or other written information, and shall compensate the other party
for any reasonable costs (excluding wages, salaries and related costs) of
making employees available, upon receipt of reasonable documentation of such 
costs. Any information obtained under this _Section 5.20(f)_ shall be kept
confidential, subject to _Section    5.2(a)_ , except as may be otherwise
required by Law.

 


 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to  the contrary, (x) in no event shall
the Seller be required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of
any Tax Return of (A) Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Entities) or (B) a Seller Consolidated Group, and (y)  neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights (pursuant to this
_Section 5.20_ or otherwise) with respect to any Tax Proceeding relating to
Taxes or any  Tax Return of (A) Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Entities) or (B) a Seller Consolidated Group.

 


 

 

(g) _Section 338 Election_. The Purchaser shall not make an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code for the sale of any Transferred Entity; _provided_
  that the Purchaser may make such an election with respect to any
Transferred Entity if the Seller reasonably determines that the election would
not have an adverse Tax effect on the Seller or any of its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser shall make such an election with
respect to any Transferred Entity if the Seller so  instructs the Purchaser
and the Purchaser reasonably determines that such election would not have an
adverse Tax effect on the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. For the
avoidance of

 


 

 

 

74  


 

 


 

 

doubt, the parties shall not make an election under Section 338(h)(10) for the
sale of the U.S. Transferred Entity.

 


 

 

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On or before the Principal Closing Date, the
rights and obligations of the Transferred Entities pursuant to all Tax sharing
agreements or arrangements, if any, to which any of the Transferred 
Entities, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are parties, shall terminate, and neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor the Transferred Entities, on the other
hand, shall have any  rights or obligations to each other after the Principal
Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

 


 

 

(i) _Post-Closing Tax Covenant_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless required by 
applicable Law, none of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including, after the date of the Applicable Closing, the Transferred
Entities) shall (i) amend any Tax Returns of a Transferred Entity for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii)  make any Tax election with respect to the
Transferred Entities that is effective in any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii)
take any action outside the ordinary course of business with respect to the
Transferred Entities, the Transferred Assets or the  Business on the
Principal Closing Date, to the extent such action would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of materially increasing any Tax liability (including any
indemnity obligation under _Section 5.20(a))_ or materially reducing any Tax
asset of the Seller or any of its Affiliates or (iv) extend any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by
or with  respect to the Business, any Transferred Asset or any Transferred
Entity, with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Principal
Closing Date (other than any such extension that is agreed to in the context
of a Tax Proceeding in  accordance with _Section 5.20(j)_).

 


 

 

(j) _Tax Contests_.

 


 

 

(i) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax  Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this Agreement;
provided, that the failure of such party to give such prompt notice  shall
not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this _Section
5.20_ , except to the extent that the other party is actually and materially
prejudiced by  such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion
of any correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

 


 

 

(ii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or  with respect to a Transferred
Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Tax Proceeding described
in _Section 5.20(j)(iii)_ or _Section 5.20(j)(iv)_ ), the Seller shall have
the exclusive right to control such Tax Proceeding; provided, that (A) the
Seller shall provide the Purchaser with a timely and reasonably detailed
account  of each material development of such Tax Proceeding and (B) the
Seller shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed, it being understood that
if Seller is contesting its obligation to indemnify the Purchaser for any
Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period subject to such Tax Proceeding, such
consent may be withheld in the Purchaser's

sole discretion). The Seller may elect in writing not to control any Tax
Proceeding that the Seller otherwise has the right to control pursuant to 
the preceding sentence. If the Seller makes such election with respect to a
Tax Proceeding, the Purchaser shall have the right and obligation to conduct
such Tax Proceeding, and the provisions of _Section 5.20(j)(iii)_ shall apply,
mutatis mutandis, with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

 


 

 

(iii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of  or with respect to a Transferred
Entity for any Straddle Period or otherwise involving both Taxes that are the
responsibility of Purchaser and Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to this Agreement (other than a Tax Proceeding  described in
_Section 5.20(j)(iv)_ ), the Purchaser shall have the right and obligation to
conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; provided, that (A) the
Purchaser  shall provide the Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed
account of each material development of such Tax Proceeding, (B) the Purchaser
shall consult with the Seller before taking any significant action in
connection with such Tax Proceeding,  (C) the Purchaser shall consult with
the Seller and offer the Seller an opportunity to comment before submitting
any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (D) the Seller shall be entitled to participate in  such Tax
Proceeding at its own expense and attend any meetings or conferences
(including phone conferences) with the relevant Taxing Authority, and (E) the
Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding
without obtaining  the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the
Seller shall not have any rights with respect to the portion of such Tax
Proceeding (and any actions, written  materials, meetings or conferences
relating thereto) that could not reasonably be expected to affect the
Liability of, or otherwise have an adverse effect on, the Seller.

 


 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this Agreement, the Seller
Group shall have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither
the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be entitled to
participate in, any Tax Proceeding with respect to (A)  any Tax Return of the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities); and (B) any Tax Return of any Seller Consolidated Group (including
any Combined Tax Return).

 


 

 

(k) _Tax Refunds._ Any refunds of Taxes for which the Seller has an indemnity
obligation under Section 5.20(a) (or credits applied in lieu of such refunds),
other than any such refund or credit of Taxes to the extent it was  included
as an asset in the calculation of Closing Working Capital that are received by
the Purchaser or its Affiliates from any Taxing Authority after the Principal
Closing Date will be for the account of the Seller (any such refund or credit,
a " _Pre-Closing Tax Refund_ "), and the Purchaser will pay over to the Seller
any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof,
less any Taxes and  reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates in connection with obtaining and receiving
any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund. The Purchaser shall, if the Seller so
requests and at the Seller's expense,  reasonably cooperate with any request
to file for and obtain or cause the Transferred Entities to file for and
obtain, any refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under this
_Section    5.20(k)_ , but shall not be obligated to seek any refund or
credit if it reasonably believes it would have a material adverse Tax effect
on the Purchaser or its Affiliates. If any Governmental Authority determines
that an amount of  Taxes refunded to the Purchaser or

 


 

 

 

76  


 

 


 

 

its Affiliates, and which the Purchaser or its Affiliates paid to the Seller
hereunder, should not have been so refunded, the Seller will promptly
reimburse the  Purchaser for such amount. To the extent that the Purchaser
reasonably determines in good faith that the amount of non-income Taxes
included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital exceeds the amount of
non-income Taxes for which the Seller  would have had an indemnity obligation
under _Section 5.20(a)_ (but for the inclusion of such non-income Taxes in
Closing Working Capital), such excess shall be treated as a  Pre-Closing Tax
Refund for purposes of this _Section 5.20(k)_.

 


 

 

(l) _Survival_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the indemnification obligations of this _Section 5.20_ shall
survive  the date of the Principal Closing and shall remain in full force
until sixty (60) days past the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitation for the Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or
waivers thereof).

 


 

 

(m) _Tax Matters Coordination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures
relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by this _Section 5.20_ ,
_Section 8.1_ , _Section 8.4(a)_   and _Section 8.6_ , and _Article VIII_
shall not apply (other than _Section 8.1_ , _Section 8.4(a)_ and _Section 8.6_
  or as otherwise provided expressly therein).

 


 

 

(n) _Section 245A Election_. The parties agree that the Seller shall timely
elect or cause an election to be made under 1.245A-5T(e)(3)(i) of the U.S.
Treasury Regulations to close the taxable year of each Transferred Entity
for  which such an election is available, as of the Applicable Closing Date.

 


 

 

Section 5.21. ___Seller Guarantees_. Prior to the Applicable Closing, the
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) arrange for substitute
bonds and guarantees, to replace the Seller Guarantees set forth on  _Section
5.21_ of the Disclosure Schedules and any Seller Guarantees entered into in
the ordinary course of business prior to the Applicable Closing, which
substitute bonds  and guarantees shall be effective as of the Principal
Closing if disclosed in writing to the Purchaser prior to the Principal
Closing (or as of the Applicable Closing if disclosed in writing to the
Purchaser prior to such time) or (b) relieve the  applicable member of the
Seller Group of and assume all obligations under each Seller Guarantee,
obtaining from the creditor, beneficiary or other counterparty a full release
(in a form satisfactory to the Seller) of all parties liable, directly or 
indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of other
obligations to a beneficiary or counterparty in connection with amounts drawn
under the Seller Guarantees. To the extent the beneficiary or counterparty
under any Seller  Guarantee does not accept any such substitute bond, the
Purchaser guarantee or other obligation proffered by the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall, from and after the Applicable Closing, (x) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each member of the  Seller Group against, and reimburse
each member of the Seller Group for, all amounts paid (including reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses) in connection with each
Seller Guarantee, including the Seller's and its Affiliates'  expenses in
maintaining such Seller Guarantees, whether or not any such Seller Guarantee
is drawn upon or required to be performed, and shall in any event promptly
reimburse the relevant member of the Seller Group to the extent any Seller
Guarantee  is called upon and the Seller or its Affiliates makes any payment
or is obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Seller Guarantee and (y)
not without the Seller's prior written consent, amend in any manner adverse to
the Seller or any of its  Affiliates, or extend (or

 


 

 

 

77  


 

 


 

 

permit the extension of), any Seller Guarantee or any obligation supported by
any Seller Guarantee.

 


 

 

Section 5.22. _Modifications to Shared Space Schedule_. The parties shall
cooperate in good faith from and after the date hereof to agree prior to the
Applicable Closing Date on any modifications to _Section 3.16(c)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules that the parties determine in good faith to be reasonably
necessary, including modifications to (i) add or remove Shared Spaces or (ii)
modify the  headcount with respect to certain Shared Spaces (with a
corresponding increase or decrease to the fees associated therewith per
headcount), it being understood that no such modification to _Section 3.16(c)_
of the Disclosure Schedules shall (A) cause any individual who would otherwise
not be a Business Employee to become a Business Employee or (B) cause any
individual who would otherwise be a Business Employee  not to be a Business
Employee.

 


 

 

Section 5.23. _Correspondence_. From and after the Principal Closing, (i) the
Seller Group shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered
promptly to the Purchaser or the Transferred Entities, as applicable, any mail
or  other communications received by any member of the Seller Group intended
for the Transferred Entities or the Business and (ii) the Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered promptly to the Seller Group
any mail or other  communications received by the Purchaser or the
Transferred Entities intended for any member of the Seller Group or any
business (other than the Business) conducted by any member of the Seller
Group. The provisions of this _Section 5.23_ are not intended to, and shall
not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by any member of the Seller
Group, the Transferred Entities, the Purchaser, or their respective 
Subsidiaries to permit acceptance service of process on its behalf, and, from
and after the Principal Closing, none of the Seller Group, on the one hand,
and the Purchaser, the Transferred Entities and their respective Subsidiaries,
on the other  hand, is or shall be deemed to be the agent of the other for
service of process purposes.

 


 

 

Section 5.24. _Reorganization_. The Seller Group shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable complete the transactions as described in _Section
5.24_   of the Disclosure Schedules but in any event at or prior to the
Principal Closing in the form and manner described in _Section 5.24_ of the
Disclosure Schedules pursuant to  documentation made available in advance to
the Purchaser (and the Seller shall review any comments proposed by the
Purchaser with respect to such documentation and will consider, in good faith,
any appropriate changes thereto prior to effecting  such transactions). The
transactions contemplated by _Section 5.24_ of the Disclosure Schedules are
referred to as the " _Reorganization_ ". The Seller Group shall take all
actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Reorganization in the most expeditious manner
practicable. The  Purchaser may propose good faith changes to _Section 5.24_
of the Disclosure Schedules at any time prior to the Principal Closing in
order to expedite the consummation of  the transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization and the Seller shall consider any such proposal in good faith
and shall not unreasonably object to, delay or condition its consent to such
proposed changes. Any such agreed changes shall be  incorporated into a
revised, amended and restated _Section 5.24_ of the Disclosure Schedules. The
Seller shall keep the Purchaser reasonably apprised with respect to the 
status of all material matters and activity relating to or concerning the
status of the Reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby and
consult with the Purchaser on a regular basis and cooperate in good faith in
connection with all of  the Purchaser's reasonable requests for information
related to the Reorganization.

Section 5.25. _Financing_.

 


 

 

(a) In the event that the Purchaser or its Affiliates enter  into any Debt
Commitment Letter on or after the date hereof, (i) the Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to the Seller true and complete copies of such fully executed
Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) prior to the Principal Closing, the Seller
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause the Seller,
its Subsidiaries, its and their Affiliates, and each of its and their
respective  officers, directors and employees to use reasonable best efforts
to provide and shall direct its and their respective accountants, legal

sole cost and expense, such  cooperation as may be reasonably requested by

Agreement for the Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of any Debt
Financing), including to:

Transferred Entities qualify as "legal  entity customers" under the
Beneficial Ownership Regulation, a Beneficial Ownership Certificate (each as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letter); and

 


 

 

(iv) cause any Transferred Entities to execute and deliver (and take corporate
and other organizational actions to approve) any Definitive Financing

the occurrence of the  Principal Closing.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) any such
requested cooperation pursuant to _Section 5.25(a)_ or otherwise shall not, in
the Seller's reasonable judgment, unreasonably interfere with the business or
the  ongoing operations of the Seller and/or its Affiliates or result in the
delay of the Principal Closing Date in any respect, (ii) nothing in this
_Section 5.25_ shall require cooperation to the extent that it would
reasonably be expected to conflict with, violate, result  in a breach of or
constitute a default under (or create an event which, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under) the organizational
documents of the Seller or any of its Affiliates, any material Contract  to
which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party or any applicable Law or

any attorney-client privilege of, or conflict with any confidentiality

or only effective as of, the Principal Closing. The Seller hereby consents to
the use of the Transferred Entities' logos in connection with the debt

logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Business or the Transferred Entities.

penalties suffered or incurred by them to the Debt Financing Sources, in
connection with the  Debt Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section 5.25_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith in each case, other than to  the extent any of the
foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct of the Seller, one of its Subsidiaries or such
other related parties as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in
a  final and non-appealable order. The Purchaser shall, promptly upon request
of the Seller, reimburse the Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-

(d) The Purchaser will not permit any amendment or  modification to be made
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Equity Financing

reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity 
Financing or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Equity Financing or any other terms to the Equity Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be  expected to (A) delay or prevent the Principal Closing
Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Equity Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtain the Equity Financing Commitment, less
likely to occur in any respect or (iii)  adversely affect the ability of the
Purchaser or the Seller, as applicable, to enforce their rights and remedies
against other parties to the Equity Financing Commitment. Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to the Seller true and complete copies of  any amendment,
modification or waiver to or under the Equity Financing Commitment entered

(e) In the event that (i) the Purchaser or its Affiliates  enter into any
Debt Commitment Letter on or after the date hereof and (ii) the Principal
Closing does not occur on or prior to January 23, 2020 (other than as a result

or  agreements contained in this Agreement), the Seller shall, upon written

after the delivery of such demand, reimburse the Purchaser, its Affiliate or
its respective  designee for any incremental documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses, including incremental fees, "ticking-fees", interest and other
charges, incurred by the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates as a result of (x)
the failure of the Principal  Closing to occur and (y)(1) the failure of the
Debt Financing contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letter to be funded or (2)
the Debt Financing contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letter has been
allocated or funded into escrow, in each case of  the foregoing clauses (x)
and (y), by such date; _provided_ that in no event shall the aggregate amount
reimbursable by the Seller pursuant to this _Section 5.25(e)_ exceed
$10,000,000; _provided_ , _further_ ,  that in the event that the Debt
Financing Sources party to such Debt Commitment Letter exercise "market flex"
provisions contained in the associated Fee Letter, the amount of such costs
and expenses incurred by the Purchaser (which shall be  reimbursed by the
Seller at the Principal Closing) with respect thereto shall be deemed to be
$10,000,000, less any amounts previously reimbursed by the Seller pursuant to
this _Section    5.25(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the following costs
and expenses shall be reimbursable to Purchaser and/or its Affiliates: (1) the
costs and expenses incurred or attributable to the period from and after
January 23, 2020  (irrespective of whether they are prepaid prior to such

attributable to the period

prior to the Applicable Closing, which resignations (or removal) shall be
effective as of the Applicable Closing.

representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit or 
knowingly encourage or facilitate the making or submission of any Acquisition
Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding an Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that informing a Person
of the  existence of this Agreement after any such Person contacts the Seller
regarding an Acquisition Proposal and the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.28_ shall not be a  breach of this _Section 5.28_ ) or (c) furnish
any information to any other Person with respect to, or agree to or otherwise
enter into, any Acquisition Proposal. The  Seller hereby confirms that it has
discontinued, and has previously directed its Affiliates and its and their
respective representatives to discontinue, any solicitation efforts or
negotiations with respect to or in furtherance of any Acquisition  Proposal.

change to a Transition Service (as defined in the Transition Services 
Agreement) or the addition of a new service, in each case, to be provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement after the Principal Closing in
the manner specified in Section 5.1 of the Transition Services Agreement as if
such provisions  applied to the period from the date hereof until the
Principal Closing, mutatis mutandis (each such change or addition a " _Change_
"). If the parties agree in writing to a Change then _Schedule 1_ of the
Transition Services Agreement shall be  amended accordingly. No Change shall
take effect unless and until such Change is agreed to in writing by the
parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Principal Closing Date shall not be
delayed in any respect as a result of any proposed Change or  any
disagreement between the parties with respect to a proposed Change.

(iii) by the Purchaser by written notice  to the Seller, if a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Seller set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such
breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that
the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

(iv) by the Seller by written notice to  the Purchaser, if a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Purchaser
set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition

such breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date; _provided_
that the Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

_provided_ that the Purchaser or the Seller shall not have the right to
terminate  this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(a)(v)_ if such party

agreements contained in this  Agreement that would cause, in the case of the

6.3(b)_ not to be satisfied or, in the case of the Seller, any condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ not to be satisfied.

any liability in  respect of such termination; _provided_ that (a) no such
termination (nor any other provision of this Agreement) shall relieve any
party from liability for any damages for  actual or intentional fraud or for
willful misconduct or intentional breach of any covenant hereunder (it being
acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that the failure to consummate
the Applicable Closing by any party that was obligated to  do so pursuant to
the terms hereof shall be deemed to be an intentional breach of a covenant
hereunder), and (b) the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ and of _Section
5.2(a)_ , _Section 5.9_ , _Section    7.1_ , _Section 9.1_ , _Section 9.2_

ARTICLE VIII

 


 

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 


 

 

Section 8.1. _No Survival_.

 


 

 

(a) None of the representations or warranties, in each  case, contained in
this Agreement, or in any certificate delivered by any party at the Principal
Closing, will survive the Principal Closing, and none of the parties shall
have any liability to each other after the Principal Closing for any breach 
thereof.

 


 

 

(b) The covenants and agreements contained in this  Agreement (i) that are
required to be performed in whole prior to each Applicable Closing shall
terminate on the Applicable Closing Date and (ii) that require performance
after each Applicable Closing shall survive until twelve (12) months after 
the date or dates expressly specified therein or, if not so specified, until
performed in accordance with their terms.

 


 

 

Section 8.2. _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Principal Closing, the 
Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Purchaser and each of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities after the Principal Closing)
(the " _Purchaser Indemnified  Persons_ ") harmless from and in respect of
any and all Losses that they may incur arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any Excluded Liability.

 


 

 

Section 8.3. _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Principal Closing,  the
Purchaser agrees to, and agrees to cause the Transferred Entities to,
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller and its Affiliates (the " _Seller Group
Indemnified Persons_ ")  harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses
that they may incur arising out of, relating to or resulting from any Assumed
Liability.

 


 

 

Section 8.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the indemnification obligations of an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations:

 


 

 

(a) _Insurance and Other Payments; Tax Benefits and Tax Costs_. Payments by an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ in respect of
any Loss shall be limited

 


 

 

 

86  


 

 


 

 

to the amount of any Loss that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the  Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) from any third parties
(other than the Indemnifying Party) in respect of any such claim, net of any
costs of recovery, and increases in premiums (to the extent such increase is
reasonably demonstrated to have  occurred as a result of the applicable
indemnifiable Loss hereunder). Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ in respect of any Loss shall (i) be reduced by
an amount equal to any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
(or its  Subsidiaries) as a result of, or arising from the recognition of,
such Loss within the taxable year that the Loss occurs or any previous taxable
year and (ii) increased by the amount of any Tax (including any withholding
Tax) cost actually incurred  by the Indemnified Party within the taxable year
of the applicable indemnification payment hereunder arising from the receipt
of such payment, as determined on a with-and-without basis. In the event that
an insurance, indemnification, contribution  or other recovery is made by the
Indemnified Party (or its Subsidiaries) with respect to any Loss for which it
has been indemnified pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , then a  refund equal
to the aggregate amount of the recovery or benefit shall be paid promptly in
immediately available funds to the Indemnifying Party that provided such
indemnification to the Indemnified Party.

 


 

 

(b) _No Duplication_. Losses shall be determined without duplication of any
other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made or could be made
under any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The 
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the
same Loss. Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction Documents to the
contrary, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall
(x) the Seller or its  Affiliates be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser and
its Affiliates pursuant to _Section 8.2_ (which shall include any
indemnification obligations of the Seller related  to _Section 1.4(b)_ and
_Section 5.8(c)_ ), or with respect to any matter (i) to the extent that 
such matter was included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital
pursuant to _Section 1.7_ or the calculation of Transaction Expenses and
Indebtedness in the Final  Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to _Section
1.8_ , or (ii) to the extent duplicative with any other indemnification
obligation under the Transaction Documents including  pursuant to _Section
5.20(a)_ or (y) the Purchaser or its Affiliates be obligated to indemnify the
Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to _Section 8.3_ (which shall include any
indemnification obligations of the Purchaser related to _Section 1.4(a)_ ,
_Section 2.5(f)_ and _Section 5.8(b)_ ) with respect to any matter to the
extent duplicative with any  other indemnification obligation under the
Transaction Documents, including pursuant to _Section 5.20(a)_ or
_Section    5.25(c)_.

 


 

 

(c) _Other Matters_. No indemnity may be sought hereunder in respect of any
Losses to the extent such Loss was taken into account in determining the Final
Purchase Price.

 


 

 

Section 8.5. _Indemnification Procedures_. The provisions of this _Section
8.5_ shall apply to any claim for indemnification pursuant  to _Section 8.2_
or _Section 8.3_ except in the case of any Tax Claims or any other matter 
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns, which shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 5.20_. The party making a claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ is referred to herein as the " _Indemnified Party_ " and the
party against whom such claims for  indemnification are asserted under this
_Article VIII_ is referred to herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ".

 


 

 

 

87  


 

 


 

 

(a) _Claim Procedure_. In order for any Indemnified Party to be entitled to
make a claim for indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , such
Indemnified  Party shall deliver a written notice (an " _Indemnification
Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after it acquires knowledge of  the fact, event or circumstance
giving rise to a claim for Losses pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , and in the
event that there has been a Third-Party Claim, such  Indemnified Party shall
provide to the Indemnifying Party an Indemnification Claim Notice with respect
thereto within forty-five (45) days following such Indemnified Party's receipt
of such claim or demand (and no fewer than ten (10) days prior to  a
scheduled appearance date in a litigated matter). Each Indemnification Claim
Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of, the facts,
circumstances and legal basis for, the amount or a good faith estimate (only
to the extent  ascertainable) of the potential Losses against which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification for, such claim asserted, and the
specific Assumed Liability or Excluded Liability, as applicable, for which
such claim for indemnification is made,  and include a statement that such
Indemnified Party believes in good faith that it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ with respect to such 
potential Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure by such
Indemnified Party to give such  Indemnification Claim Notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. After
delivery of an Indemnification Claim Notice to the  Indemnifying Party, (i)
the Indemnified Party which has provided such Indemnification Claim Notice
shall, upon written request from the Indemnifying Party, supply and make
available to the Indemnifying Party and its representatives all relevant
information in its or its Affiliates' possession relating to the claim
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party (except to the extent that
such  action would result in a loss of attorney-client privilege; _provided_
, that such Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such  information in such format to the Indemnifying Party, or on an
outside counsel only basis or in such other manner which would not result in
the loss of such attorney-client privilege) and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall, and shall cause its and  its employees and representatives, to (A) be
reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party and its representatives (at the
Indemnifying Party's cost and expense) during normal business hours to discuss
such claim, (B) render to the Indemnifying Party and its representatives such
assistance as may reasonably be requested, (C) provide reasonable access to
such properties, facilities, books, records, accountant  work papers and
other documents or information in their possession or that may be reasonably
obtained as the Indemnifying Party and/or its representatives  may reasonably
require ( _provided_ that the accountants of the Indemnified Party shall not
be obligated to make any working papers available to the Indemnifying Party or
its  representatives unless and until such party or such representative,  as
applicable, has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants), and (D) otherwise cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party  and its representatives in good faith. Without limiting
the foregoing, such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying  Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party or its
representatives of books, records and other documents and information which
are  actually and reasonably relevant to such claim.

 


 

 

(b) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be  asserted by the Indemnified Party by delivering an Indemnification Claim
Notice with respect to such Direct Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly in
accordance with _Section  8.5(a)_. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its representatives to investigate the Excluded
Liability or  Assumed

 


 

 

 

88  


 

 


 

 

Liability, as applicable, alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and
whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct
Claim to the  Indemnified Party as provided in _Section 8.5(a)_. The
Indemnifying Party may, within sixty (60) days after receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Notice  with respect to such Direct Claim, deliver to
the Indemnified Party a written response disputing such claim, which response
must state in reasonable detail the basis for and reasons why the Indemnifying
Party disputes such claim, together with  reasonable supporting detail. If
the Indemnifying Party fails to deliver a written response disputing such
claim within such sixty (60) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed
to have waived its right to dispute such claim and such claim  shall have
been deemed to have been agreed to by the Indemnifying Party.

 


 

 

(c) _Third-Party Claims_.

 


 

 

(i) If any Indemnified Party receives  notice of the assertion or
commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is not a party to
this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a " _Third-
Party  Claim "_) against such Indemnified Party with respect to which such
Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnification Claim
Notice with respect  to such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party
promptly in accordance with _Section 8.5(a)_. Such Indemnification Claim
Notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe  the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all letters, claims, complaints,
filings, documents and correspondence received by the Indemnified Party or its
representatives with respect thereto, and all other material written evidence
thereof.

 


 

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have  the right (and be entitled), but not
the obligation, to investigate, participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
Indemnification Claim Notice relating to such Third-Party Claim to  assume
and control the defense of, or settle (subject to _Section 8.5(c)(v)_ ), any
Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the 
Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
good faith in such defense.

 


 

 

(iii) In the event that the Indemnifying  Party timely notifies the
Indemnified Party it desires (and is permitted pursuant to _Section
8.5(c)(vi)_ ) to assume and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim 
pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)(ii)_ , it shall diligently prosecute such Third-
Party Claim and it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary  to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the  defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof; _provided_ that if there exists a  conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party as has been
determined by the Indemnified Party's outside legal counsel or is there are
one or more different defenses to such Third-Party Claims, the reasonable
and  documented costs and expenses of one (1) counsel of the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to be an indemnifiable Loss hereunder.

 


 

 

 

89  


 

 


 

 

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party elects not  to compromise or defend such
Third-Party Claim or is not permitted to defend such Third-Party Claim, fails
to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend
as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently defend  the Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to the provisions of this _Article
VIII_ , pay, compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim and seek 
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third-Party Claim. Each of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall keep the other and the other's representatives reasonably informed
concerning the status of any such Third-Party Claim and any related
proceedings and all stages thereof. Each of the parties hereto and the
Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other
in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, including making available (subject to the confidentiality provisions
of this Agreement) and  retaining records relevant or relating to such Third-
Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of
the non-defending party as may be  reasonably necessary for the preparation
of the defense for, and the defense of, such Third-Party Claim.

 


 

 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision  of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not compromise or otherwise enter into any judgment or settlement
of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or
delayed), other than a compromise, judgment or settlement that (A) is on
exclusively monetary terms with, subject to the limitations in _Section 8.4_ ,
such  monetary amounts paid by the Indemnifying Party concurrently with the
effectiveness of the compromise, judgement or settlement, (B) does not involve
any finding or admission of violation of Law or admission of wrongdoing by the
Indemnified Party,  and (C) provides in customary form, an unconditional
release of, or dismissal with prejudice of, all claims against any Indemnified
Party potentially affected by such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
has assumed the defense pursuant to  _Section 8.5(c)_ , it shall not agree to
any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third-Party Claim (A) seeks relief other
than the payment of monetary damages or would result in the imposition of a
Governmental Order  that would restrict in any respect any present or future
activity or conduct of the Indemnified Parties or any of its controlled
Affiliates (including, in the case of the Purchaser, the Transferred Entities)
or (B) seeks a finding or admission of a  violation of Law (including any
Third-Party Claim seeking to impose criminal fines, penalties or sanctions) or
of any Governmental Order or of a violation of the rights of any Person by the
Indemnified Parties or any of its controlled Affiliates  (including, in the
case of the Purchaser, the Transferred Entities), then, in each such case, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to solely direct the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim.

 


 

 

Section 8.6. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree that
any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless 
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 


 

 

 

90  


 

 


 

 

Section 8.7. _R andW Insurance Policy_. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any
way limit the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person from making any
claims or receiving any recoveries under the RandW Insurance Policy,  whether
for breaches under this Agreement or any other claim that may be permitted to
be made under the RandW Insurance Policy.

of the item so disclosed. With respect to each of the Disclosure Schedules and
the Purchaser  Disclosure Schedules, any disclosure made on any section or
subsection thereof with respect to any representation or warranty shall be
deemed to be made with respect to any representation or warranty to which such
disclosure's application or  relevance is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure.

 


 

 

Section 9.8. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise  breached
and money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for
any such failure to perform or breach of this Agreement. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions
to  prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled

 


 

 

 

112  


 

 


 

 

at law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the posting of any
bond or other  security in connection therewith. Subject to _Section 7.2_ ,
nothing contained herein shall prevent a party from seeking damages in the
event that specific performance is not  available. It is explicitly agreed
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Seller shall have the
right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing the Purchaser's obligations to  consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and cause the Equity Financing to
be funded (including to cause Purchaser to enforce the obligations of the
Equity Financing Sources under the Equity Financing Commitment in order to
cause  the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing
Commitment), which right shall be subject to the requirement that (i) all
conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ were satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions which by their terms are to be  satisfied at the
Principal Closing) at the time when the Principal Closing would have been
required to occur, but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded
and (ii) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed that if the Equity Financing
is  funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement
to cause the Principal Closing to occur.

 


 

 

Section 9.9. _Governing Law, etc_. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the internal
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of  laws
rules thereof to the extent that the application of the law of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably agrees
that any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated  hereby shall be brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, then any state or  federal court within the State of
Delaware), and each party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts in any such Action. A final judgment in any such Action may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in  any other manner
provided by Law. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in such courts, and
hereby  irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further agrees that service
of any process, summons,  notice or document to such party pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ , or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. EACH OF THE  PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF OR 
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH. EACH OF THE  PARTIES HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN

 


 

 

 

113  


 

 


 

 

INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 9.9_.

 


 

 

Section 9.10. _Construction_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. The language used in this Agreement is the 
language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any party.

 


 

 

Section 9.11. _Local Transfer Agreements_.

 


 

 

(a) The parties do not intend this Agreement to transfer  title to any
Transferred Parent Equity Interests or Transferred Assets, or to constitute
the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities, in any jurisdiction in which such
transfer or assumption is required by applicable Law to be made pursuant to
a  Local Transfer Agreement, and any such Transferred Parent Equity Interests
or Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, as applicable, shall only be
transferred or assumed by the applicable Local Transfer Agreement (which
transfers and assumptions  shall (other than the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ ) be on an "as-is", "where-is"
basis, without representation or warranty of any  kind or nature). The
parties shall (or shall cause their applicable Subsidiary to) execute and
deliver any requisite Local Transfer Agreement no later than the Applicable
Closing Date; _provided_ that the parties shall not enter into any Local
Transfer Agreement with respect to a jurisdiction in which the Seller has an
obligation to inform and consult with Business Employees regarding the
transactions  contemplated hereby, until the Seller has concluded its
information and consultation process, and such Local Transfer Agreement shall
reflect any changes as may be reasonably agreed by the parties to take into
account the results of such  information and consultation process.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of _Section 9.11(a)_ , to the extent that
the provisions of a Local Transfer Agreement (including any provisions
required by local Law to be included in the Local Transfer  Agreement) are
inconsistent with, or (except to the extent they implement a transfer in
accordance with this Agreement) additional to, the provisions of this
Agreement (or do not fully give effect to the provisions of this Agreement
with respect to  the transfer of the Transferred Parent Equity Interests and
Transferred Assets or the assumption of Assumed Liabilities): (i) the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and (ii) so far as permissible
under applicable Law of the relevant  jurisdiction, the Seller Group and the
Purchaser shall cause the provisions of the relevant Local Transfer Agreement
to be adjusted, to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of
this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Each party hereto shall not, and shall cause its  respective Affiliates
not to, bring any claim (including for breach of any warranty, representation,
undertaking, covenant or indemnity relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby) against the other party or any of its Affiliates in respect of  or
based upon any of the Local Transfer Agreements, except to the extent
necessary to enforce any transfer of the Transferred Parent Equity Interests
and Transferred Assets or the assumption of Assumed Liabilities sold or
assigned to the Purchaser  hereunder in a manner consistent with the terms of
this Agreement. All such claims (except as referred to above) shall be brought
in accordance with, and be subject to the provisions, rights and limitations
set out in, this Agreement, and no party  shall be entitled to recover
damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity under or
pursuant to any of the Local Transfer Agreements

 


 

 

 

114  


 

 


 

 

(but without prejudice to the establishment of the existence of the claim
hereunder). To the extent that a party does bring such a claim (except as
referred to above),  that party shall indemnify the other party (and/or that
other party's relevant Affiliates) against all Losses which it or they may
suffer through or arising from the bringing of such claim against it or them.

 


 

 

Section 9.12. _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each party to this
Agreement agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and
representatives, that Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP may serve as counsel to 
the Seller, on the one hand, and the Business and any Transferred Entity, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and that,
following consummation of such transactions, Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP (or
any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller or any Affiliate or
representative of the Seller, in  connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation, in each case, solely arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (a " _Section 9.12 Dispute_ ") notwithstanding such prior
representation of the Business or any Transferred Entity and each party to
this Agreement consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest  arising
therefrom, and each party to this Agreement shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation; _provided_   that this sentence shall not apply if Cravath,
Swaine and Moore LLP, at the time of such _Section 9.12_ Dispute, is handling
ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the  Transferred Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates.

 


 

 

Section 9.13. _Privilege_. The Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, and
its and its Affiliates' respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally acknowledges and agrees in connection with a _Section
9.12_ Dispute that all attorney-client privileged communications between the
Seller, any Transferred Entity or their respective current or former
Affiliates or  representatives and their counsel, including Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP, made before the consummation of any Applicable Closing in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and any
Applicable Closing under this  Agreement or any Transaction Document, any
dispute arising from this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or, before any Applicable
Closing, any other matter (the " _Privileged Communications_ "), shall
continue after such Applicable Closing to be privileged communications with
such counsel ( _provided_ , that such privilege from and after the Principal
Closing shall be solely held and controlled by Seller) and neither the
Purchaser nor any of its former or current Affiliates or representatives nor
any Person  purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser or any of
its current of former Affiliates or representatives, shall (i) seek to obtain
the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such
Privileged Communications  belongs to the Purchaser, any Transferred Entity
or the Business or on any other grounds or (ii) use or rely on any such
Privileged Communications in any Section 9.12 Dispute.

 


 

 

Section 9.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic .pdf
submission), and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of 
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.15. _Non-Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth in the other
Transaction Documents (including the Equity Financing Commitment) or the
Confidentiality Agreement, all

 


 

 

 

115  


 

 


 

 

claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether at Law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under,  out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document (including any representation or  warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document ), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as 
parties to this Agreement or such other Transaction Document (the "
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
any current, former or future  equityholder, incorporator, controlling
person, general or limited partner, member, Affiliate, assignee or
representative of, and any financial advisor to, any Contracting Party, or any
current, former or future equityholder, incorporator,  controlling person,
general or limited partner, Affiliate, assignee or representative of, any of
the foregoing or any of their respective successors, predecessors or assigns
(or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the foregoing) (collectively, 
the " _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any Liability (whether in Law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) for any claims, causes
of action,  obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection
with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or such other Transaction
Document or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document or its  negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach (other than as expressly set forth in the other Transaction Documents,
including, the Equity Financing Commitment, or the Confidentiality Agreement),
and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each  Contracting Party hereby
waives and releases all claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities
arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this
Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or  its
negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as expressly set
forth in the other Transaction Documents, including, the Equity Financing
Commitment, or the Confidentiality Agreement) against any such Non-Party
Affiliates. Without  limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in the other
Transaction Documents or the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) each Contracting
Party hereby waives and releases any and all  rights, claims, demands, or
causes of action that may otherwise be available, whether at Law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a Contracting  Party on
any Non-Party Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or
otherwise,  in each case arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach
and (ii) each Contracting Party  disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Party
Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.16. _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Seller on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective controlled Affiliates hereby: (i) agrees that 
all Actions (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the
agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter) entered into in connection
with the Debt  Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder involving the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties shall be subject to the exclusive

 


 

 

 

116  


 

 


 

 

jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any
appellate court  thereof and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and
its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court, and such Action (except to the extent relating to the
interpretation of any provisions in this  Agreement (including any provision
in the Debt Commitment Letter or in any definitive documentation related to
the Debt Financing that expressly specifies that the interpretation of such
provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance  with the law of
the State of the Delaware)) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws, (ii) agrees not to bring or support or permit
any  of its controlled Affiliates to bring or support any Action (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the agreements (including the
Debt Commitment Letter)  entered into in connection with the Debt Financing
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance
of any services thereunder against any Debt Financing Source Related Party in
any forum other than any federal or state  court in the Borough of Manhattan,
New York, New York, (iii) agrees that service of process upon the Seller, its
Subsidiaries or their respective controlled Affiliates in any such Action
shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 9.1_ , (iv)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court, (v) 
irrevocably and unconditionally waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury in any Action brought
against the Debt Financing Sources directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection  with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder, (vi) agrees that none of the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties will have  any Liability to the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective controlled Affiliates or
representatives (in each case, other than the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries)
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing,  the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) and (vii) agrees that the Debt Financing Source Related Parties are
express  third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions
in this Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in this _Section 9.16_
(including, for the  avoidance of doubt, _Section 9.4_ (solely to the extent
it relates to the Debt Financing Source Related Parties))and such provisions
and the definition of "Debt Financing  Sources" and "Debt Financing Source
Related Parties" shall not be amended in any way adverse to the Debt Financing
Source Related Parties without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in  this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Seller or any of its Affiliates be entitled
to, or permitted to seek, specific performance in respect of any Debt
Financing Source Related Party related to the Debt Financing under the terms
of  this Agreement prior to the Principal Closing Date, and nor shall there
be any right of the Seller or its Affiliates to enforce specifically any of
Seller's and its Affiliates' respective rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter or any other  agreements relating to the Debt Financing.
