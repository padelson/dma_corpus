iv    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of October
17, 2000, by and among Predictive Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Acquiror"), Grape Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("Merger Sub"), Science Applications
International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Principal Stockholder") and Global Integrity Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Principal Stockholder
("Target"). Certain other capitalized terms used in this Agreement are as
defined herein.   RECITALS   A. The Boards of Directors of Target,
Acquiror and Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and the stockholders of their respective companies that
Target and Merger Sub combine into a single company through the statutory
merger of Target with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Merger.   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other
things, (i) each outstanding share of common stock of Target, $0.001 par
value ("Target Common Stock"), shall be converted into shares of common stock
of Acquiror, $0.001 par value ("Acquiror Common Stock"), at the rate set
forth herein and (ii) each holder of Target Common Stock shall receive a cash
payment as set forth herein.   C. Target, Acquiror, Merger Sub and the
Principal Stockholder desire to make certain representations and warranties
and other agreements in connection with the Merger.   D. The parties
intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Sections 368(a) of the Code.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the covenants and representations set forth herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Certificate of Merger") and the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), Target shall be merged with and into Merger
Sub, the separate corporate existence of Target shall cease and Merger Sub
shall continue as the surviving corporation. Merger Sub as the surviving
corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."    1    1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take
place as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof or at such other time as the
parties hereto agree (the date on which the Closing shall occur, the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer
Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, 733 Third Avenue, New York, New York,
10017, or at such other location as the parties hereto agree. On the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time
and date of such filing being the "Effective Time" and the "Effective Date,"
respectively).   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of
Merger and the applicable provisions of DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Target
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by the DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation;
provided, however, that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation shall
be amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Global
Integrity Corporation."   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.   1.5 Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold
office until such time as such directors resign, are removed or their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until such time as such
officers resign, are removed or their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. By virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Target or
the holders of any of Target\'s securities:   (a) Conversion of Target
Common Stock.   (i) At the Effective Time, the total amount of
consideration (consisting of Acquiror Common Stock valued as set forth below
and cash) to be paid by Acquiror (including Acquiror Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon exercise of unexpired and unexercised options
outstanding to purchase Target Common Stock assumed by Acquiror pursuant to
1.6(c), whether vested or unvested ("Target Options")) in exchange for all
outstanding shares of Target    2   Common Stock and the assumption of
Target Options shall be (A) five million seven hundred ninety one thousand
three hundred twenty three (5,791,323), multiplied by the weighted average
closing market price of the Acquiror Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market for the five trading days immediately prior to the Effective
Date (the "Closing Price"), plus (B) twenty eight million four hundred sixty
thousand two hundred seventy dollars ($28,460,270) (such sum, the "Initial
Total Consideration"). Other than for additional cash payments to holders of
Target Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(vi) and adjustments to the
Option Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 5.15) of Target Options pursuant
to 5.15(a) resulting from the application of the calculation set forth on
Annex A hereto, and pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.6(a)(vii), in no
event shall the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in
respect of the outstanding shares of Target Common Stock and Target Options,
at any time, exceed 5,791,323 in the aggregate nor shall the cash to be paid
to the stockholders of Target Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.6, at
any time, exceed $28,460,270.   (ii) Subject to Section 1.6(a)(iii) below,
the amount of Initial Total Consideration allocable to the outstanding Target
Common Stock (the "Initial Target Stockholder Consideration") shall equal the
product of the Initial Total Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Target Common Stock
outstanding, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Target
Common Stock outstanding plus the number of shares of Target Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of outstanding Target Options. The amount of Initial
Total Consideration allocable to the outstanding Target Options (the "Initial
Target Optionholder Consideration") shall equal the product of the Initial
Total Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding
Target Options, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of
Target Common Stock outstanding plus the number of shares of Target Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Target Options. All calculations
under this subparagraph (ii) shall be made based on the number of Target
Options or shares of Target Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (iii) The Initial Target Stockholder Consideration shall
be comprised as follows: (A) $28,460,270 (the "Cash Consideration"), and (B)
a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration")
obtained by dividing (x) the amount by which the Initial Target Stockholder
Consideration exceeds the Cash Consideration, by (y) the Closing Price.  
(iv) At the Effective Time, each share of Target Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Target Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and Dissenting
Shares, as defined in Section 1.6(h)) will be canceled and extinguished and
be converted automatically into the right to receive (A) a number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Stock Consideration divided by the
number of shares of Target Common Stock then outstanding (the "Exchange
Ratio"), and (B) an amount of cash equal to the Cash Consideration divided by
the number of shares of Target Common Stock then outstanding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the amount of Cash Consideration otherwise payable to the
Principal Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be reduced by the
amount of debt (the "Debt") greater than three million dollars   
3   ($3,000,000) to be repaid to the Principal Stockholder by or on behalf
of Target pursuant to Section 5.25.   (v) No adjustment shall be made in
the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in the Merger as a
result of (A) any increase or decrease in the market price of Acquiror Common
Stock prior to the Effective Time or (B) any cash proceeds received by Target
from the date hereof to the Closing Date pursuant to the exercise of
currently outstanding Target Options.   (vi) In addition to the Initial
Target Stockholder Consideration, at the time specified and upon the
achievement of the milestones set forth on Annex A hereto, the former holders
of shares of Target Common Stock shall receive the "Additional Target
Stockholder Consideration," as defined on and calculated pursuant to Annex A
hereto. At such specified time, each such holder shall receive an amount of
Additional Target Stockholder Consideration equal to (A) the aggregate
Additional Target Stockholder Consideration, divided by the number of shares
of Target Common Stock held by such holders on the Effective Date, multiplied
by (B) the number of shares of Target Common Stock such holder held on the
Effective Date.   (vii) If either (i) the tax opinion referred to in
Section 6.1 of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian,
LLP ("Gunderson") cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by Gunderson
Dettmer and concurred in by Heller Ehrman White and McAuliffe LLP ("Heller") or
(ii) the tax opinion referred to in Section 6.1 of Heller cannot be rendered
(as reasonably determined by Heller and concurred in by Gunderson), in either
case a result of the Merger potentially failing to satisfy the requirements
of Section 368(a) of the Code, then Acquiror shall reduce to the minimum
extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case
may be, to be rendered, the Cash Consideration and correspondingly increase
the Stock Consideration by an amount equal to the decrease in the Cash
Consideration divided by the Closing Price.   (b) Cancellation of Target
Capital Stock Owned by Acquiror or Target. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, all shares of capital stock of Target ("Target Capital Stock") that are
owned by Target as treasury stock, and each share of Target Capital Stock
owned by Acquiror or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquiror or of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) Target
Stock Option Plans. At the Effective Time, the Target 1998 Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended and restated on April 27, 2000 (the "Target Stock Option
Plan") and all options to purchase Target Common Stock then outstanding under
the Target Stock Option Plan shall be assumed by Acquiror in accordance with
Section 5.15.   (d) [Reserved.]   (e) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the
Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub
("Merger Sub Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and    4   nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par
value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall thereupon evidence ownership of
such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (f)
Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Acquiror Common Stock or Target Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Acquiror Common Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (g)
Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock will be
issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Target Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall receive from Acquiror an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the closing market price of the Acquiror Common
Stock on the Effective Date.   (h) Dissenters\' Rights. Shares of Target
Common Stock held by persons who have not voted such shares for approval of
the Merger and with respect to which such persons shall be entitled to
exercise dissenters\' rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into Acquiror Common Stock and
cash but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Target agrees that, except with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, or as required under the DGCL, it will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such purchase demand. Each holder of Dissenting Shares ("Dissenting
Stockholder") who, pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled
to payment of the fair value for shares of Target Common Stock shall receive
payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed
upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after
the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as
Dissenting Shares, Acquiror shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such
stockholder of certificate or certificates representing shares of Target
Common Stock, the cash and the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under this Section 1.6 and
the Certificate of Merger, less the cash and the number of shares allocable
to such stockholder that have been or will be deposited in the Escrow Fund
(as defined below) in respect of such shares of Acquiror Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.7(c) and Article VIII hereof.   1.7 Surrender of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.  
(b) Acquiror to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures   
5   as Acquiror may adopt, the Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) in exchange for shares of Target Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time less (i) the Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration to be deposited into an escrow fund (the "Escrow
Fund") pursuant to the requirements of Article VIII hereof and (ii) cash in
an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(g).   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Target Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares)
pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the
Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash and certificates
representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Acquiror, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash and a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock
and payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6 (less the number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder\'s behalf pursuant to
Article VIII hereof), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to
the Effective Time, represented shares of Target Common Stock will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the
payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares
of Acquiror Common Stock into which such shares of Target Common Stock shall
have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in
accordance with Section 1.6. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3 hereof,
Acquiror shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent (as defined in
Section 8.3 hereof) a certificate or certificates (the "Escrow Certificates")
representing a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Escrow
Consideration divided by the Closing Price (which shall be registered in the
name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for such stockholders of Target).
The "Escrow Consideration" shall be 5% multiplied by the Initial Target
Stockholder Consideration otherwise deliverable to the Principal Stockholder
pursuant to Section 1.6 (calculated prior to reduction for the Debt in excess
of $3,000,000 to be repaid pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(iv) and Section 5.25).
The shares deposited in the Escrow Fund shall be beneficially owned by the
Principal Stockholder and shall be held in escrow and shall be available to
compensate Acquiror for certain damages as provided in Article VIII. To the
extent not used for such purposes, such shares shall be released, all as
provided in Article VIII hereof.   (d) Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Acquiror Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate surrenders    6   such Certificate. Subject
to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time which would have
been previously payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with
respect to such shares of Acquiror Common Stock.   (e) Transfers of
Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that such issuance be in accordance with applicable law and that the
Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Acquiror or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Acquiror Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Acquiror or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none
of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be
liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  
(g) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 1.7 shall also apply to
Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of Acquiror under this Section 1.7 shall commence on the date of loss of such
status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for such shares the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof.   (h) Withholding Rights.
Each of the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Target Stock such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Target
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, as the case may be.   1.8 No Further
Ownership Rights in Target Common Stock. All shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Target Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Target Common Stock, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Target Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   
7    1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares) as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however, that
Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.   1.10 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368 of the Code. No party shall take any action which would, to
such party\'s knowledge, cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.   1.11 Taking
of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Target, the officers and directors of Target and Merger Sub are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET AND PRINCIPAL  STOCKHOLDER  
Target and the Principal Stockholder, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to Acquiror and Merger Sub that the statements contained in
this Article II are true and correct, except as set forth in the disclosure
letter delivered by Target to Acquiror prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, as amended in accordance with Section 5.8(b), subject to the
last sentence of 5.8(b) (the "Target Disclosure Letter"). The Target
Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the
numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article II, and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify only the corresponding paragraph in
this Article II. Any reference in this Article II to an agreement being
"enforceable" shall be deemed to be qualified to the extent such
enforceability is subject to (i) laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and the relief of debtors, and (ii) the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.   2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Target is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization. Target has the corporate power to own
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as
proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
9.2) on Target. Target has delivered to Acquiror a true and correct copy of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other charter documents, as
applicable, of Target,    8   each as amended to date. Target is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
or equivalent organizational documents. Target does not own any subsidiaries
and does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or
any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity.   2.2 Capital Structure. The authorized
capital stock of Target consists of 32,000,000 shares of Target Common Stock
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share (the
"Target Preferred Stock"), of which there were issued and outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement, 16,000,000 shares of Target Common Stock and no
shares of Target Preferred Stock. There are no other outstanding shares of
capital stock or voting securities and no outstanding commitments to issue
any shares of capital stock or voting securities after the date of this
Agreement other than pursuant to the exercise of options outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement under the Target Stock Option Plan. All
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any liens or
encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon
the holders thereof, and are not subject to preemptive rights, rights
of first refusal, rights of first offer or similar rights created by statute,
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Target or any agreement to
which Target is a party or by which it is bound. As of the date of this
Agreement, Target has reserved 2,400,000 shares of Target Common Stock for
issuance to employees, directors and consultants pursuant to the Target Stock
Option Plan, of which no shares have been issued pursuant to option exercises
or direct stock purchases, 2,358,200 shares are subject to outstanding,
unexercised options. Except for (i) the rights created pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) rights created pursuant to the Target Stock Option Plan,
there are no other options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of any character to which Target is a party or by which it is
bound obligating Target to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or
cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of
Target Capital Stock or obligating Target to grant, extend, accelerate the
vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such
option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. The Target Disclosure
Letter also sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all outstanding
Target Options (which, for each outstanding option, sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, the name of the holder of such option, the number of
shares subject to such options, the amount of such options that are vested
and the vesting schedule for any unvested options, the type of stock subject
to such option, the exercise price of such option, the repricing of any such
option and, if the exercisability of such option will be or is required to be
accelerated in any way by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or for any other reason, an indication of the extent of such acceleration and
the reason therefor) (the "Option Schedule"). There are no contracts,
commitments or agreements relating to the voting, purchase or sale of Target
Capital Stock (i) between or among Target and any of its stockholders and
(ii) to the best of Target\'s knowledge, among any of Target\'s stockholders
or between any of Target\'s stockholders and any third party, except for the
stockholders delivering Voting Agreements. The terms of the Target Stock
Option Plan permit the assumption of such Target Stock Option Plan by
Acquiror or the substitution of options to purchase Acquiror Common Stock as
provided in this Agreement, without the consent or approval of the holders of
the outstanding options, the Target stockholders, or otherwise and without
any acceleration of the exercise schedule or vesting provisions in effect for
such options. True and complete    9   copies of all agreements and
instruments relating to or issued under the Target Stock Option Plan have
been made available to Acquiror, and such agreements and instruments have not
been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements to amend,
modify or supplement such agreements or instruments from the form made
available to Acquiror. All outstanding Target Capital Stock, Target Options,
Target Warrants and other Target securities, if any, were issued in
compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws,
except where the failure to so comply would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Target.   2.3 Authority.   (a) Target has all requisite
corporate power, and authority to enter into this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, in substantially the form as Exhibit C hereto, to be entered into
among Acquiror, Target, the Principal Stockholder and The Chase Manhattan
Bank, as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"), and the Amended and Restated
the Registration Rights Agreement, in substantially the form as Exhibit H

and with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, collectively, the

hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Target, subject only to the approval of the
Merger by Target\'s stockholders as contemplated by Section 6.1(a).
This Agreement and other Transaction Documents have been duly executed and
delivered by Target and constitute the valid and binding obligations of
Target enforceable against Target in accordance with their terms.   (b) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
by Target do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any benefit under (i) any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Target, as amended, or (ii) any
contract or any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Target or
any of its properties or assets, except for such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights or losses which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Target. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, the Target Board of
Directors has unanimously (i) approved the Merger, (ii) resolved to recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Target
stockholders, and (iii) has not withdrawn or modified such approval or
resolution to recommend.   (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative
agency or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality
("Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to Target in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger,
together with the required officers\' certificates, as provided in Section
1.2; (ii) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as    10   may be required under applicable
state securities laws and the securities laws of any foreign country; (iii)
such filings as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR"); and (iv) such other consents,
authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which have been made or,
if not obtained or made, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Target
and would not prevent, or delay beyond January 15, 2001 any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   2.4 Financial Statements.
Target has delivered, or if not delivered prior to date hereof, will deliver
prior to the Closing, to Acquiror its audited financial statements (balance
sheet, statement of operations, statement of stockholders\' equity and
statement of cash flows) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999 and 2000,
and its unaudited financial statements (balance sheet, statement of
operations, statement of stockholders\' equity and statement of cash flows)
on a consolidated basis as at, and for the eight-month period ended September
29, 2000 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements
have been (or will be) prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") (except that the unaudited financial
statements do not have notes thereto) applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods indicated and with each other. The Financial
Statements fairly present (or will fairly present), in all material respects,
the financial condition and operating results of Target as of the dates, and
for the periods, indicated therein, subject; in the case of the unaudited
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not
material in the aggregate. Target maintains a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP.   2.5 Absence of
Certain Changes. Since September 29, 2000, Target has conducted its business
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not
occurred: (i) any material adverse change to the business, financial
condition or results of operation or the properties, assets and liabilities
of Target, but excluding changes arising from or relating to:   (A)
conditions generally affecting the information security,  information
technology, technology, e-commerce, banking or  financial services
industries; or   (B) conditions generally affecting the United States
economy;  (ii) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any material asset of
Target; (iii) any change in accounting methods or practices (including any
change in depreciation or amortization policies or rates) by Target or any
revaluation by Target of any of its assets; (iv) any declaration, setting
aside, or payment of a dividend or other distribution with respect to the
shares of Target, or any direct or indirect redemption, purchase or other
acquisition by Target of any of its shares of capital stock; (v) any contract
entered into by Target, other than as provided to Acquiror, or any amendment
or termination of, or default under, any contract to which Target is a party
or by which it is bound that has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Target; (vi) any amendment or change
to the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Target; (vii) any increase
in or modification of the compensation or benefits payable or to become
payable by Target to any of its directors, employees or consultants whose
annual compensation is $100,000 or more; (viii)    11   capital
expenditures or capital commitments by Target exceeding $100,000 individually
or $500,000 in the aggregate; (ix) any transaction or agreement with the
Principal Stockholder other than the loaning of funds by the
Principal Stockholder to Target in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices and repayment of such funds by Target to the Principal
Stockholder; and (x) any agreement by Target to do any of the things
described in the preceding clauses (i) through (ix).   2.6 Absence of
Undisclosed Liabilities. Target has no material obligations or liabilities of
any nature (matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent) other than (i) those
set forth or adequately provided for in the Balance Sheet for the period
ended September 29, 2000 (the "Target Balance Sheet"), (ii) those incurred in
the ordinary course of business after September 29, 2000, (iii) those not
required to be set forth in the Target Balance Sheet under GAAP and (iv)
those incurred in connection with the execution of this Agreement.   2.7
Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable to be listed on the Target
Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business in connection
with bona fide transactions. To Target\'s knowledge, no material amount of
the accounts receivable are subject to any material claim of offset or
recoupment, or counterclaim except for accounts receivable expressly reserved
against in the Target Balance Sheet. Other than with respect to contracts
recorded on a percentage completion basis, no material amount of accounts
receivable are contingent upon the performance by Target of any
obligation.   2.8 Litigation. There is no private or governmental action,
suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending before any
agency, court or tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, to the knowledge of
Target and the Principal Stockholder, threatened against Target or the
Principal Stockholder, or any of their respective properties or officers or
directors (in their capacities as such) that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Target. There is no judgment, decree or order against Target or the Principal
Stockholder, or, to the knowledge of Target or the Principal Stockholder, any
of their respective directors or officers (in their capacities as such), that
could prevent, enjoin, or materially delay any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Target. Target does not have any plans to
initiate any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding against any third
party, other than for the routine collection of bills. The Principal
Stockholder does not have any plans to initiate any litigation, arbitration
or other proceeding against any third party relating to Target.   2.9
Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no agreement, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon Target or the Principal Stockholder,
that has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
impairing any current business practice of Target, any acquisition of
property by Target or the conduct of business by Target as currently
conducted in a manner that would result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Target.   2.10 Governmental Authorization. Target has obtained each
federal, state, county, local or foreign governmental consent, license,
permit, grant, or other authorization of a Governmental Entity (i) pursuant
to which Target currently operates or holds any interest in any of its
properties or (ii) that is required for the operation of Target\'s business
as currently conducted or the holding of any such interest ((i) and (ii)
herein collectively called "Target    12   Authorizations"), and all of
such Target Authorizations are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to obtain or have any such Target Authorizations would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Target.   2.11 Title to Property. Target has good
and valid title to all properties, and assets, real and personal it owns or
uses for the conduct of its business as presently conducted including without
limitation those that are or will be reflected in the Target Balance Sheet or
acquired after September 29, 2000 (except properties, and assets sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since September 29,
2000), or with respect to leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests therein, in each case free and clear of all mortgages, liens,
pledges, charges or encumbrances of any kind or character, except (i) the
lien of current taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) such imperfections of
title, liens and easements as do not and will not materially detract from or
interfere with the use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby,
or otherwise materially impair business operations involving such properties
and (iii) liens securing debt to be reflected on the Target Balance Sheet.
All material tangible assets used as of September 19, 2000 in the business
and operations of Target are set forth on Schedule 2.11. Other than as set

Except as identified in Schedule 2.12(a)(ii), assuming Target continues to

termination and all other encumbrances of any nature that could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
financial condition or results of operation of Target. The conduct of
Target\'s business as currently conducted by Target or as currently proposed

misappropriate or violate any Intellectual Property (defined below) of
others. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.12(a)(iii): (w) Principal
Stockholder has transferred or assigned, or will transfer or assign, to

that was owned by the Principal Stockholder and is exclusively used in
connection with the business of Target as presently conducted or as currently
proposed to be conducted; (x) Principal Stockholder has transferred or
assigned, or will transfer or assign, to Target all right, title and interest

licensed to the Principal Stockholder by third parties and used
nonexclusively by Target in connection with the business of Target as
presently conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted, except any non-
sublicensable or nontransferrable off-the-shelf software available to Target
on commercially reasonable terms.   (b) Schedule 2.12(b)(i) identifies all
Target Intellectual Property that is the subject of any application,
registration or issuance with or from any governmental entity ("Registered
Intellectual Property") and registered to, owned by, or exclusively licensed
to Target and Schedule 2.12(b)(ii) identifies Registered Intellectual
Property registered to, owned by, or exclusively licensed to Principal
Stockholder, if any. All such registered or issued Target Intellectual
Property is valid and subsisting and is free from any challenge, and neither
Target nor Principal Stockholder are aware of any basis therefor. All such
applications, registrations and issuances have been properly maintained.  
(c) Target has endeavored to adequately protect all other Target Intellectual
Property through the use of confidentiality agreements and otherwise and
neither Target nor Principal Stockholders is aware of any use, exercise or
exploitation of any Target Intellectual Property, except as authorized by
Target or identified in Schedules 2.12(c).   (d) Schedule 2.12 (d)(i)

Principal Stockholder, neither the United Statement Government nor any other
customer or third party is in violation of any licenses or agreements with
respect to any Target Intellectual Property.   (e) Schedule 2.12(e)

operated its business in material compliance with all Environmental Laws, and
to the knowledge of Target and the Principal Stockholder, no material
expenditures are or will be required in order to comply with such
Environmental Laws. "Environmental Laws" means all applicable statutes,
rules, regulations, ordinances, orders, decrees, judgments, permits,
licenses, consents, approvals, authorizations, and governmental requirements
or directives or other obligations lawfully imposed by governmental authority
under federal, state or local law pertaining to the protection of the
environment, protection of public health, protection of worker health and
safety, the treatment, emission and/or discharge of gaseous, particulate
and/or effluent pollutants, and/or the handling of hazardous materials,
including without limitation, the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ss.7401, et seq.,
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980 ("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. ss.9601, et seq., the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, 33 U.S.C. ss.1321, et seq., the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. ss.1801, et seq., the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. ss.6901, et seq. ("RCRA"), and the
Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. ss.2601, et seq.   2.14 Taxes.  
(a) All Tax returns, statements, reports, declarations and other forms and
documents (including without limitation estimated Tax returns and reports and
material information returns and reports) required to be filed with any Tax
authority with respect to any Taxable period ending on or before the Closing,
by or on behalf of Target (collectively, "Tax Returns" and individually a
"Tax Return"), have been or will be completed and filed when due
(including any extensions of such due date) and all amounts shown due on such
Tax Returns on or before the Effective Time have been or will be paid on or
before such date. The Target Financial Statements (i) fully accrue all actual
and contingent liabilities for Taxes (whether or not shown as due on the Tax
Returns) with respect to all periods through the Target Balance Sheet Date
and Target has not and will not incur any Tax liability in excess of the
amount reflected on the Target Balance Sheet included in the Target Financial
Statements with respect to such periods, other than Taxes incurred in the
ordinary course of its business following the Target Balance Sheet, and (ii)
fully accrues in accordance with    15   GAAP all material liabilities
for Taxes payable after the Target Balance Sheet Date with respect to all
transactions and events occurring on or prior to such date. All information
set forth in the notes to the Target Financial Statements relating to Tax
matters is true and accurate in all material respects. With respect to
periods after the Target Balance Sheet Date, no Tax liability has been
incurred by Target which exceeds the amount of Tax liability that would have
been incurred in the ordinary course of business of Target during such period
had Target not been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary group for Tax purposes during any part of such period, and
adequate provision has been made by Target for all Taxes since that date on
at least a quarterly basis. Other than with respect to (i) the amount of
Taxes reflected in the reserve for Tax liability reflected on the Target
Balance Sheet that is part of the Target Financial Statements, and (ii) the
amount of Taxes that would have been incurred by Target in the ordinary
course of business between the Target Balance Sheet Date and the Closing had
Target not been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group for Tax purposes during any part of such period, Principal Stockholder
has the sole and absolute liability with respect to the payment of any Taxes
imposed on Target attributable to any Tax year or portion thereof ending on
or before the Closing (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after
the Closing to the extent allocable to the portion of such period beginning
before and ending on the Closing) and Principal Stockholder shall pay all
such Taxes when due. If Principal Stockholder pays any Tax that is
attributable to the period between the Target Balance Sheet Date and the
Closing and would have been incurred by Target in the ordinary course
of business had Target not been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group for Tax purposes during any part of such period,
then Target shall reimburse Principal Stockholder for the amount of such Tax
within 21 business days after receipt from Principal Stockholder of a written
claim for such reimbursement together with a reasonably detailed written
computation of the amount thereof, unless Target reasonably disagrees with
such computation or other basis for such claim in which case, if the parties
cannot come to agreement within 30 days, the dispute shall be submitted to
arbitration in accordance with Section 8.8 hereof. If Principal Stockholder
pays any other Tax attributable to Target as to any Tax year or portion
thereof ending on or before the Target Balance Sheet Date (or for any Tax
year beginning before and ending after the Target Balance Sheet Date to the
extent allocable to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on
the Target Balance Sheet Date), then up to the amount of the reserve for Tax
liability reflected on the Target Balance Sheet that is part of the Target
Financial Statements (reduced by (i) prior reimbursements paid to Principal
Stockholder pursuant to this sentence, (ii) amounts previously paid by Target
or Acquiror to a Tax authority in respect of a Tax otherwise reimbursable
pursuant to this sentence and, (iii) amounts previously paid or reasonably
expected to be paid in respect of Taxes covered by or relating to periods
covered by such Tax reserve), then Target shall reimburse Principal
Stockholder for the amount of such Tax within 21 business days after receipt
from Principal Stockholder of a written claim for such reimbursement together
with a reasonably detailed written computation of the amount thereof unless
Target reasonably disagrees with such computation or other basis for
such claim in which case, if the parties cannot come to agreement, the
dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 8.8
hereof.   (b) Target has previously provided or made available to
Acquiror copies of all income, franchise, and sales Tax Returns as filed with
the appropriate Tax authority, and, as reasonably requested by Acquiror,
prior to or following the date hereof, presently existing information
statements and reports. Target has withheld and paid to the applicable
financial institution or Tax authority all amounts required to be withheld.
To the best knowledge of    16   Target, no Tax Returns filed with
respect to Taxable years of Target through the Taxable year ended December
31, 1999 in the case of the United States, have been examined and closed.
Target (or any member of any affiliated or combined group of which Target has
been a member) has not granted any extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any Tax Returns that is still in effect. There is no
material claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding, or (to the knowledge of
Target or the Principal Stockholder) investigation now pending or (to the
knowledge of Target or the Principal Stockholder) threatened against or with
respect to Target in respect of any Tax or assessment. No notice
of deficiency or similar document of any Tax authority has been received by
Target, and there are no liabilities for Taxes (including liabilities for
interest, additions to Tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with
respect to the issues that have been raised (and are currently pending) by
any Tax authority that could, if determined adversely to Target, materially
and adversely affect the liability of Target for Taxes. There are no liens
for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the
assets of Target. Target is in full compliance with all the terms and
conditions of any Tax exemptions or other Tax-sharing agreement or order of a
foreign government and the consummation of the Merger will not have any
adverse effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax
exemption or other Tax-sharing agreement or order. Neither Target nor any
person on behalf of Target has entered into or will enter into any agreement
or consent pursuant to the collapsible corporation provisions of Section
341(f) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign
income tax law) or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code (or
any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income tax law) apply
to any disposition of any asset owned by Target. None of the assets of Target
is property that Target is required to treat as being owned by any other
person pursuant to the so-called "safe harbor lease" provisions of former
Section 168(f)(8) of the Code. None of the assets of Target directly or

with all applicable federal and state law and regulations, including without
limitation those within the jurisdiction of the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, United States Department of Labor and
state and local human rights or civil rights agencies, except where such

the use of his or her best efforts to promote the interests of Target or that
could reasonably be expected to conflict with any of Target\'s business as
conducted or proposed to be conducted. Neither the execution nor delivery of
this Agreement nor the conduct of Target\'s business as conducted or proposed

been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or
bonds. All premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have
been paid and Target is otherwise in material compliance with the terms of
such policies and bonds. Target has no knowledge of any threatened
termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any of such
policies.   2.19 Compliance with Laws. Target has complied with, is not
in violation of, and has not received any notices of violation with respect
to, any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law or regulation with
respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
business, except for such violations or failures to comply as could not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.   2.20

all of the material obligations required to be performed by it and is
entitled to all benefits under, and is not alleged to be in default in
respect of any contract, except where the failure to so perform or the
failure to be entitled to all benefits or such default would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Target. Each of the Material Contracts is in full
force and effect, and there exists no default or event of default or event,
occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Target or to Target\'s
knowledge with respect to the other contracting party, or otherwise that,

a default or event of default under any Material Contract, which default or
event of default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Target or (B) result in the loss or expiration of any
material right or option by Target (or the gain thereof by any third party)
under any Material Contract or (C) result in the release, disclosure or

statements contained herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which made, not misleading.   ARTICLE II-A   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER   In addition to the joint and
several representations made in Article II hereof, the Principal Stockholder
hereby represents and warrants that:   2A.1 Authority.   (a) The Principal
Stockholder has all requisite power, corporate or otherwise, and authority to
enter into this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Principal Stockholder. This Agreement and other Transaction
Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Principal Stockholder
and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Principal Stockholder
enforceable against the Principal Stockholder in accordance with their
terms.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents by the Principal Stockholder do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default under (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any
benefit under (i) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
of the Principal Stockholder, as amended, or (ii) any material contract or
any material permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Principal
Stockholder or any of its properties or assets, except where such conflict,
violation, default, right or loss would not result in the prevention or
material delay of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   2A.2
Title to Stock. The Principal Stockholder has good and valid title to the
Target Common Stock held by it, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances,
equities or claims. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options,

other commitments or agreements of any character relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock or other securities of any such subsidiary, or
otherwise obligating the Principal Stockholder or any such subsidiary to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities.   2A.3 No Distribution. The Principal Stockholder is acquiring
the shares for investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and
not with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distributions
thereof, except in compliance with applicable securities laws. It understands
that the shares of Acquiror Common Stock have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption from
the registration provisions of the Securities Act, the availability of which
depends upon, among    25   other things, the bona fide nature of the
investment intent and the accuracy of the Principal Stockholder\'s
representations as expressed herein.   2A.4 Sophistication of Principal
Stockholder. The Principal Stockholder understands that Acquiror has a
limited financial and operating history and that an investment in Acquiror
involves substantial risks. The Principal Stockholder further understands
that the purchase of the shares of Acquiror Common Stock is a highly
speculative investment. The Principal Stockholder is able, without impairing
the Principal Stockholder\'s financial condition, to hold the shares
of Acquiror Common Stock and for an indefinite period of time and to suffer
a complete loss of the Principal Stockholder\'s investment.   2A.5
Accredited Investor. The Principal Stockholder is an accredited investor
within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 501 of
Regulation D, as presently in effect.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND

schedule delivered by Acquiror to Target prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, as amended in accordance with Section 5.8(b), subject to
the last sentence of Section 5.8(b) (the "Acquiror Disclosure Schedule"). The
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to
the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III, and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify only the corresponding paragraph in
this Article III. Any reference in this Article III to an agreement being
"enforceable" shall be deemed to be qualified to the extent such
enforceability is subject to (i) laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and the relief of debtors, and (ii) the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.   3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Acquiror and
its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of
Acquiror and its subsidiaries has the corporate power to own its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be
conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good
standing would have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. Acquiror has
delivered a true and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws or other charter documents, as applicable, of Acquiror and its
subsidiaries, each as amended to date, to Target. Neither Acquiror nor Merger
Sub (or any other subsidiary) is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents. Acquiror is the owner of all outstanding shares of capital stock
of each of its subsidiaries and all such shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each such subsidiary are owned by Acquiror free and clear of
all liens, charges, claims or encumbrances or rights of others. There   
26   are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other securities of any such subsidiary, or otherwise obligating Acquiror
or any such subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities. Except as disclosed in the Acquiror
SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.4), Acquiror does not directly or
indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity.   3.2 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of
Acquiror consists of 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value,

granted outside the Acquiror Stock Option Plan. The authorized capital stock
of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, all

shares of Acquiror and Merger Sub have been duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and are nonassessable and free of any liens or encumbrances other
than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon the holders thereof
and are not subject to preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or other
similar rights created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
of Acquiror or Merger Sub or any agreement to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is
a party or by which it is bound. As of the date hereof, Acquiror had reserved

Stock upon the exercise of outstanding options granted outside the Acquiror
Stock Option Plan. Other than as set forth above and the commitment to issue
shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, there are no other
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is a party or by which either of them is
bound obligating Acquiror or Merger Sub to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase

any shares of the capital stock of Acquiror or Merger Sub or obligating
Acquiror or Merger Sub to grant, extend or enter into any such option,

or other statutory right of stockholders, will be issued in compliance with
applicable U.S. Federal and state securities laws and will be free of any

may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements

of Acquiror; (v) capital expenditures or capital commitments by Acquiror
exceeding $500,000 individually or $2,500,000 in the aggregate; (vi) any

any of its subsidiaries, threatened against Acquiror or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or any of their respective
officers or directors (in their capacities as such) that, individually or in
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Acquiror. There is no judgment, decree or order against Acquiror or any of
its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries,

contemplated by this Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. Acquiror does not have any plans to
initiate any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding against any third
party, other than for routine collection on bills.   3.7 [Intentionally
Omitted].   3.8 Compliance with Laws. Acquiror has complied with, is not

Effect on Acquiror. Each of the Acquiror Material Contracts is in full force
and effect, and there exists no default or event of default or event,
occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Acquiror or Acquiror\'s
knowledge with respect to the other contracting party, or otherwise that,
with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of the time or happening of
any other event or conditions, could reasonably be expected to (A) become a
default or event of default under any Acquiror Material Contract which
default or event of default could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Acquiror or (B) result in the loss or expiration of any
material right or option by Acquiror (or the gain thereof by any third party)
under any Acquiror Material Contract, which loss or expiration would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror or (C) result in the release, disclosure
or delivery to any third party of any party of    30   the Source

and any other Federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders

Acquiror and Target decide that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Target

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquiror nor Target shall be required
to agree, as a condition to any approval, to divest itself of or hold
separate any subsidiary, division or business unit which is material to the
business of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
the divestiture or holding separate of which would be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on (A) the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of such party and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the benefits intended to be derived
as a result of the Merger.   5.8 Update Disclosure; Breaches. From and
after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, (a) each party
hereto shall reasonably promptly notify the other party in writing of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which would be likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the
failure of a party hereto, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which would be likely to result in any condition
to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, and (b) each
party shall reasonably promptly notify the other party, by written update to
its Disclosure Schedule, of any event, change, effect, matter or state of
facts occurring after the date of this Agreement, which would, if occurring
prior to the date of this Agreement, have been required to have been
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules to make such party\'s representations
and warranties true and correct. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.8 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice, provided that such party, within ten days after
receipt of such notice, advises the other party of its objection to
the matter disclosed in such notice and the nature of such objection.   5.9

at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Target or any of its
subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") in    37   respect of acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law and as provided under Target\'s Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws and indemnification agreements in effect on the date
hereof. Each Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary
of this Section 5.10 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section

Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws as presently in effect or as provided
by Delaware law.   (b) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects

or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and

respective subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on them
with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to any
party hereto necessary in connection with any such requirements imposed upon
such other party in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will take all reasonable actions necessary
to obtain (and will cooperate with the other parties hereto in obtaining) any
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or any registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or other person, required
to be obtained or made in connection with the taking of any action
contemplated by this Agreement.   5.13 Tax-Free Reorganization. Neither
Target, Acquiror nor Merger Sub will, either before or after consummation of
the Merger, take any action which, to the knowledge of such party, would
cause the Merger to fail to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Code Section 368.   5.14 Blue Sky Laws. Acquiror shall take such steps as
may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all
jurisdictions which are applicable to the issuance of the Acquiror Common
Stock in connection with the Merger. Target shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Acquiror as may be necessary to comply with the securities
and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are applicable in connection
with the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the
Merger.    38    5.15 Stock Options.   (a) At the Effective Time, the
Target Stock Option Plan and each Target Option, whether vested or unvested,
shall be assumed by Acquiror, and Target\'s repurchase right with respect to
any unvested option shares granted under the Target Stock Option Plan shall
be assigned to Acquiror and Acquiror shall thereafter comply with the terms
of the Target Stock Option Plan with respect to such assumed Target Options.
On the Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Acquiror an updated Option
Schedule current as of such date. Each Target Option so assumed by Acquiror
under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the Target Stock Option Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such Target Option shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Target Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, (ii) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Target Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Target Common Stock at which such
option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole cent. The vesting of any
unvested Target Options will not accelerate as a result of the execution
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Within 45 business days after the Effective Time, Acquiror will issue
to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of a
Target Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Target
Option by Acquiror, and within 45 business days after an adjustment to the
Option Exchange Ratio as a result of the provisions of Annex A hereto,
Acquiror will issue to each such person a revised document reflecting the
adjusted Option Exchange Ratio. The "Option Exchange Ratio" shall equal the
quotient obtained by dividing the Acquiror Stock Subject to Target Options by
the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise
of all Target Options. The "Acquiror Stock Subject to Target Options" shall
equal the quotient obtained by dividing the Initial Target Optionholder
Consideration plus the Additional Optionholder Consideration (as defined and
calculated in Annex A), if any, by the Closing Price for the Acquiror Common
Stock.   (b) Acquiror shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
and make available for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock for delivery under Target Options assumed in accordance with
this Section 5.15. Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall file

forms) or amend an existing registration statement with respect to the shares
of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such Target Options and shall use its
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements for so long as such Target Options remain
outstanding.   (c) At the time specified and upon the achievement of
the milestones set forth on Annex A hereto, each holder of Target Options
assumed in the Merger that exercised such options prior to the Determination
Date (as defined on Annex A), shall receive (A) the Additional Exercised
Option Consideration (as defined on Annex A), divided by the aggregate number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued upon exercise of options assumed in
the Merger    39   prior to the Determination Date, multiplied by (B)
the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock obtained by such holder upon
the exercise of options assumed in the Merger prior to the Determination
Date.   5.16 Escrow Agreement. On or before the Effective Time,
Acquiror, Target, the Escrow Agent and the Stockholders\' Agent (as defined

the Total Acquiror Shares and any additional shares of Acquiror Common Stock
required to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of Target Options assumed
by Acquiror and shall use reasonable best efforts to get such shares accepted
for quotation prior to the Effective Time.   5.18 Additional Agreements;
Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of the parties agrees to use their reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by

by provision of information. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all

Target or Acquiror, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall take all such necessary action.   5.19 Employees; Benefits.

to Target and the Principal Stockholder a schedule of those employees of
Target that Acquiror does not wish to continue to employ after the Merger.
Acquiror shall take such reasonable actions, to the extent permitted by
Acquiror\'s benefits programs as they may be amended, as are necessary to
allow eligible employees of Target to participate in the benefit programs of
Acquiror, or alternative benefits programs in the aggregate substantially
comparable to those applicable to employees of Acquiror on similar terms, as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger, including (i)
waiving all limitations as to pre-existing conditions exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and (ii) providing each such employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
in satisfying any applicable deductible out-of-pocket requirements under such
plan . For purposes of satisfying the terms and conditions of such programs,
to the extent permitted by Acquiror\'s benefit programs as they may be
amended, Acquiror shall give full credit for eligibility, or vesting for each
participant\'s period of service with Target. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

investigation conducted before or after the Closing Date, and notwithstanding
any actual or implied knowledge or notice of any facts or circumstances which
Acquiror or Target may have as a result of such investigation or otherwise,
Acquiror and Target will be entitled to rely upon the other party\'s
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement. The
obligations of the parties with respect to their representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants will survive the Closing and continue in full force
and effect until the date 12 months following the Effective Time
(the "Termination Date"), at which time, subject to Section 8.5, the
representations, warranties and covenants of the parties set forth in this
Agreement and any liability of the parties with respect to those
representations, warranties and covenants will terminate; provided, however
that the representations and warranties (and the obligation of the parties
with respect thereto) contained in Section 2.14(a) and the covenants
contained in Section 5.23(a) shall survive until expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations period with respect to the Tax at issue. If a claim is
made by either party prior to the expiration of any representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants, such claim shall survive until such
claim is finally resolved.   8.2 Indemnity. From and after the Effective
Time of the Merger, and subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, Acquiror
and the Surviving Corporation (on or after the Closing Date) shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Principal Stockholder against, and
reimbursed for, any liability, damage, loss, obligation, demand, judgment,
fine, penalty, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses, and the costs of investigation incurred in defending against or
settling such liability, damage, loss, cost or expense or claim therefor and
any amounts paid in settlement thereof, imposed on or reasonably incurred by
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation as a result of (i) any breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant on the part of Target or the
Principal Stockholder under this Agreement or (ii) any of the matters listed
on Schedule 2.8 (collectively the "Damages"). "Damages" as used   
50   herein is not limited to matters asserted by third parties, but
includes Damages incurred or sustained by Acquiror in the absence of claims
by a third party. The Principal Stockholder may satisfy any claim for which
it is required to indemnify the Acquiror and/or the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this Section 8.2 with, at the Principal Stockholder\'s sole
discretion: (A) cash; (B) Acquiror Common Stock; or (C) shares from the
Escrow Fund. For purposes of compensating the Acquiror for its damages
pursuant to this Agreement, the Acquiror Common Stock and/or shares from the
Escrow Fund delivered or to be delivered to Acquiror to satisfy the claim for
indemnification hereunder shall be valued at the weighted average closing
price of the Acquiror Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the five
(5) trading days immediately preceding the date of payment of such claim.  
8.3 Escrow Fund. As security for the indemnity provided for in Section 8.2
hereof, the Escrow Certificates shall be deposited by Acquiror in an escrow
account with The Chase Manhattan Bank (or other mutually
acceptable institution) as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), as of the
Effective Time, such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund")
to be governed by the terms set forth in this Agreement and the provisions of
an Escrow Agreement to be executed and delivered pursuant to Section 5.16.
Upon compliance with the terms hereof and subject to the provisions of this
Article VIII, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
obtain indemnity from the Escrow Fund for Damages covered by the indemnity
provided for in Section 8.2 of this Agreement. Any and all distributions of
Acquiror Common Stock issued in respect thereof (including, without
limitation, any shares issued pursuant to any stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or reclassification thereof) shall be the
property of the Principal Stockholder and shall be deposited with the Escrow
Agent. Cash dividends or other property distributed in respect of Acquiror
Common Stock shall be delivered to Principal Stockholder and shall not be
deposited with or retained by the Escrow Agent. The Principal Stockholder
shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights
pertaining to the Acquiror Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund (the "Escrow
Shares") or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms
of this Agreement.   8.4 Damage Threshold and Limitations. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Acquiror may not receive any payment from the Escrow Fund
unless and until an Officer\'s Certificate (as defined in Section 8.6 below)
identifying Damages the aggregate amount of which exceeds $750,000 has been
delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.5 below and such
amount is determined pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable, in which
case Acquiror shall receive payment equal in value to the full amount of
Damages. In determining the amount of any Damage attributable to a breach,
any materiality standard contained in a representation, warranty or covenant
of Acquiror shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Acquiror shall not be entitled to indemnity with respect to
any lost profits or other consequential, incidental, indirect, special or
punitive damages. In addition, the maximum amount payable by the Principal
Stockholder pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII
shall not exceed the Initial Total Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Damages arising from a breach, nonfulfillment of or
noncompliance with any of the representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements made by Principal Stockholder or Target in this Agreement relating
to Taxes incurred by reason of or in connection with Target being part of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group for Tax purposes
(including any exhibit, letter, schedule, certificate or document   
51   delivered pursuant hereto or other instrument referred to herein) or
any facts or circumstances constituting such an inaccuracy, breach,
nonfulfillment or noncompliance shall be unlimited.   8.5 Escrow Period.
The Escrow Period shall terminate at the expiration of twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time; provided, however, that a portion of the Escrow
Fund, which is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officer\'s Certificate theretofore delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
termination of the Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances
existing prior to expiration of the Escrow Period, shall remain in the Escrow
Fund until such claims have been finally resolved, including
without limitation any claims relating to items set forth on Schedule 2.8
hereto.   8.6 Claims upon Escrow Fund.   (a) Upon receipt by the Escrow
Agent on or before the Termination Date of a certificate signed by the chief
financial or chief executive officer of Acquiror (an "Officer\'s
Certificate"):   (i) stating that Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
has incurred, paid or properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP) or knows of
facts giving rise to a reasonable probability that it will have to incur, pay
or accrue (in accordance with GAAP) Damages in an aggregate stated amount
with respect to which Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation is entitled to
payment from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement; and   (ii)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Damages included in
the amount so stated, the date each such item was incurred, paid or properly
accrued (in accordance with GAAP), or the basis for such anticipated
liability and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is
related,  the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.7
of this Agreement, deliver to Acquiror shares of Acquiror Common Stock, in an
amount necessary to indemnify Acquiror for the Damages claimed; provided,
however, that no shares of Acquiror Common Stock or cash shall be delivered
to Acquiror, as a result of a claim based upon an accrual of, or upon a
reasonable probability of having to incur, pay or accrue Damages until such
time as the Acquiror has actually incurred or paid Damages. All cash and
shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such claims shall remain in the
Escrow Fund until Damages are actually incurred or paid or the Acquiror
determines in its reasonably good faith judgment that no Damages will be
required to be incurred or paid (in which event such cash and shares shall be
distributed to the Principal Stockholder in accordance with Section 8.10
below).   (b) For the purpose of compensating Acquiror for its
Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Acquiror Common Stock in the Escrow
Fund shall be valued as set forth in Section 8.2.   8.7 Objections to
Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer\'s Certificate to the Escrow
Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer\'s Certificate shall be delivered to
the Principal Stockholder and for a period of forty-five (45) days after such
delivery to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of cash
or Acquiror Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof
unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written   
52   authorization from the Principal Stockholder to make such delivery.
After the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, the Escrow Agent
shall make delivery of the Acquiror Common Stock or other property in the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.6 hereof, provided that no such
payment or delivery may be made if the Principal Stockholder shall object in
a written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s Certificate, and such
statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Acquiror prior
to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period.   8.8 Resolution of
Conflicts; Arbitration.   (a) In case the Principal Stockholder shall object
in writing to any claim or claims by Acquiror made in any Officer\'s
Certificate, the Principal Stockholder and Acquiror shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims. If the Principal Stockholder and Acquiror should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Acquiror
Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof.   (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation for sixty (60) days, either Acquiror or the Principal
Stockholder may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the
matter unless the amount of the Damage is at issue in pending litigation with
a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either
such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three
arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is given,
Acquiror and the Principal Stockholder shall each select one arbitrator, and
the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision
of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officer\'s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to
this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 8.6 hereof, the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and
make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.  
(c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in New York,
New York under the commercial rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section 8.8, in any
arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the
Officer\'s Certificate is at issue, Acquiror shall be deemed to be the Non-
Prevailing Party unless the arbitrators award Acquiror more than one-half
(1/2) of the amount in dispute, plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise,
the Principal Stockholder shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The
Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees
of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys\' fees
and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration.   
53    8.9 Intentionally Omitted.   8.10 Distribution Upon Termination of
Escrow Period. Within five (5) business days following the Termination Date,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Principal Stockholder all of the shares
in the Escrow Fund in excess of any amount of such shares reasonably
necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied or disputed claims for Damages specified
in any Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent on or before the
Termination Date and any unsatisfied or disputed claims by the Principal
Stockholder. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to the Principal Stockholder all shares remaining in the Escrow
Fund and not required to satisfy such claims.   8.11 Intentionally
Omitted.   8.12 Third-Party Claims. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of
a third-party claim which Acquiror believes may result in a demand against
the Escrow Fund, Acquiror shall notify the Principal Stockholder of such
claim, and the Principal Stockholder shall be entitled, at his expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Acquiror shall have the right in
its sole discretion to settle any such claim; provided, however, that
Acquiror may not effect the settlement of any such claim without the consent
of the Principal Stockholder, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. In the event that the Principal Stockholder has
consented to any such settlement, the Principal Stockholder shall have no
power or authority to object under Section 8.6 or any other provision of this
Article VIII to the amount of any claim by Acquiror against the Escrow Fund
for indemnity with respect to such settlement.   8.13 Indemnity by
Acquiror.   (a) From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, and
subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, the former stockholders of Target
("Target Indemnitees") shall be indemnified and held harmless by Acquiror
against, and reimbursed for, any liability, damage, loss, obligation, demand,
judgement, fine, penalty, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses, and the costs of investigation incurred in defending
against or settling such liability , damage, loss, cost or expense or claim
therefor and any amounts paid in settlement thereof, imposed on or reasonably
incurred by Target Indemnitees as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant on the part of Acquiror under
this Agreement (collectively the "Target Damages"). "Target Damages" as used
herein is not limited to matters asserted by third parties, but includes
Target Damages incurred or sustained by Target Indemnitees in the absence of
claims by a third party.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Target
Indemnitees may not receive any payment from Acquiror unless and until an
Officer\'s Certificate (as defined in Section 8.6) identifying Target Damages
the aggregate amount of which exceeds $750,000 (the "Target Basket") has been
delivered to the Chief Financial Officer of the Acquiror as provided below
and such amount is determined pursuant to this Section 8.13 to be payable and
then only for any and all such losses without regard to the Target Basket,
but only up to an amount equal to an aggregate of the Initial Total
Consideration.    54    (c) The period in which the Target Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification shall terminate at the expiration of
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time; provided, however, that any
claims made prior to the expiration of such period shall survive until such
claims have been finally resolved.   (d) Upon receipt by Acquiror on or
before the Termination Date of a certificate signed by the Principal
Stockholder:   (i) stating that the Target Indemnitees have incurred or
paid or knows of facts giving rise to a reasonable probability that it will
have to incur Target Damages in an aggregate stated amount with respect to
which the Target Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 8.13; and   (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual
items of Target Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such
item was incurred or paid, or the basis for such anticipated liability and
the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related,  Acquiror
shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (e), deliver to the Target
Indemnitees, at its option, cash or Acquiror Common Stock, in an
amount necessary to indemnify the Target Indemnitees for the Target Damages
claimed. If the Acquiror shall choose to satisfy such claim by delivering
Acquiror Common Stock, such stock shall be distributed to the Target
Indemnitees pro rata and shall be valued in accordance with Section 8.2.  
(e) For a period of forty-five (45) days after delivery of the certificate by
the Principal Stockholder to Acquiror, Acquiror shall have the right to
object in a written statement to the claim made in the certificate delivered
by the Principal Stockholder. If no objection is made, Acquiror shall issue
Acquiror Common Stock to the Target Indemnitees as provided in subparagraph
(d) above. If Acquiror does so object, the Principal Stockholder and Acquiror
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties. If no such agreement can be reached in sixty (60) days, the conflict
shall be resolved in accordance with Section 8.8.   (f) The right to stock
in accordance with this Section 8.13 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Target Indemnitess after the Closing with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Acquiror or Merger
Sub under this Agreement and no former stockholder, optionholder,
warrantholder, director, officer, employee or agent of Acquiror shall have
any personal liability to any Target Indemnitee after the Closing in
connection with the Merger.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1

Requirements of Operating the Business. Acquiror shall continue the
operations of Target and the Electronic Services Business following the
Closing in good faith and in a manner consistent with the business
practices of Target prior to the Closing.   4. Change of Control. In the
event there is a Change of Control (as defined below) of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company after the Closing (the "Applicable Entity"), Acquiror shall
use its best efforts to cause the other party to such Change of Control to
continue the operations of Target and the Electronic Services Business
following the Change of Control in good faith and in a manner consistent with
the business practices of Target prior to Closing. For the purposes hereof,
"Change of Control" of the Applicable Entity means the happening of any of
the following: (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the Applicable
Entity\'s assets; (ii) the merger or consolidation of the Applicable Entity
into or with another person or entity; (iii) when any "person" as defined in
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") and as used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof including
a "group" as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act but excluding
the Applicable Entity and any subsidiary and any existing stockholder to the
extent of their holdings as of the date of the Agreement, directly or
indirectly, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13(d)-3 under
the Exchange Act, as amended from time to time), of securities of the
Applicable Entity representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of
the Applicable Entity\'s then outstanding securities; or (iv) with respect to
Acquiror, when, during any period of three (3) consecutive months during
calendar year 2001, the individuals who, at the beginning of such period,
constitute the Board of Directors of Acquiror (the "Incumbent Directors")
cease for any reason other than death to constitute at least a majority
thereof; provided, however, that a director who was not a director at the
beginning of such three-month period shall be deemed to have satisfied such
three-month requirement (and be an Incumbent Director) if such director was
elected by, or on the recommendation of or with the approval of, at least
two-thirds of the directors who then qualified as Incumbent Directors either
actually (because they were directors at the beginning of such three-month
period) or by prior operation of this paragraph 3. Upon a Change of Control,
Acquiror shall notify Principal Stockholder as soon as is commercially
possible that such a Change of Control has occurred and the circumstances
relating thereto.   5. Reporting Requirements.   (a) Within forty five
(45) days following the close of each calendar quarter during 2001, Acquiror
shall deliver to the Principal Stockholder a statement in which it shall
accurately account for all Revenues of the Electronic Services Business
described in this Annex A for such quarter then ended (the "Quarterly
Revenues Notice"), and within one hundred twenty days (120) days following
December 31, 2001, Acquiror shall deliver to the Principal Stockholder
audited financial statements which accurately account for all  
2   Revenues of the Electronic Services Business described in this Annex A
for the year then ended (the "Final Revenues Notice"), in both cases showing
in reasonable detail the computation thereof, to be accompanied by a
certification of Acquiror\'s chief financial officer that, in the opinion of
such officer after examining the books and records of Acquiror and Target,
that the statement of Acquiror presents fairly in all material respects the
Revenues required to be recognized in accordance with this Annex A and that
such computation was complete and accurate.   (b) Upon receipt of the
Quarterly Revenues Notice and the Final Revenues Notice, Principal
Stockholder may, at its own expense, audit the books and records of Acquiror
and Target in which the information concerning Revenues is recorded, and the
records supporting the entries in the books of Acquiror and Target, for that
quarter or year or any prior quarterly period for which Principal Stockholder
had not previously audited such books and records; provided, however, that
such audits be performed no more often than quarterly during normal business
hours and at the place where those books and records are kept. Principal
Stockholder shall notify Acquiror of such audit results specifying in
reasonable detail all disputed items and the basis therefor (the "Audit
Notice"). After receipt of the Audit Notice, Acquiror shall have thirty (30)
days to review the Audit Notice. Unless the Acquiror delivers a
written objection to Principal Stockholder on or prior to the 30th day after
receipt of the Audit Notice, the Acquiror shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to results set forth in the Audit Notice.   6. Dispute
Resolution. If the Acquiror notifies Principal Stockholder of its objection
to the Audit Notice, the Acquiror and the Principal Stockholder shall, within
ten (10) days following such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to
resolve their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If Principal Stockholder and
Acquiror are unable to agree on the amount of Revenues that should be
recognized for the applicable quarterly period, then, promptly after the
Resolution Period, the Principal Stockholder and Acquiror shall select a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm other than the
Principal Stockholder\'s or Acquiror\'s current or former independent
accounting firms (the "Neutral Auditor") to resolve the amount under dispute
(the "Disputed Amount"), which firm shall conclusively resolve the Disputed
Amount within ten (10) days or as soon as possible thereafter. If Principal
Stockholder and Acquiror are unable to agree on the Neutral Auditor, then the
Principal Stockholder and Acquiror shall each have the right to request the
American Arbitration Association to appoint the Neutral Auditor (other than
the Principal Stockholder\'s or Acquiror\'s regular independent accounting
firms). The findings of the Neutral Auditor shall be final and binding upon
the parties.   7. Payment of Additional Cash, Adjustment to Options. The
Additional Cash to be paid hereunder to each former stockholder of Target and
to each optionholder to the extent that such optionholder exercises
options prior to the Determination Date shall be so paid, and the adjustment
of the number and exercise price of Acquiror options pursuant to Section 5.15
shall be so made on the Determination Date. The Determination Date shall be
the earlier of (a) 150 days after December 31, 2001 and (b) the date the
Principal Stockholder notifies Acquiror in writing of its agreement with the
Final Revenues Notice; provided, that if the Principal Stockholder chooses to
audit the Final Revenues Notice as provided in 5(c), such cash shall not be
paid and the adjustment to the Acquiror options shall not be made until the
resolution of such audit as provided above.   3   '
