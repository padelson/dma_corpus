 _ **SPONSOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT**_

  



  

This **SPONSOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
November 27, 2019, is made by and between HighPeak Pure Acquisition, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Sponsor_ "), and Pure Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "). The Sponsor and Parent shall be
referred to herein from time to time collectively as the " _Parties_."
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Business Combination Agreement (as
defined below).

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , Parent and certain other parties, including affiliates of the
Sponsor, entered into that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof (as it may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from
time to time, the " _Business Combination Agreement_ "); and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the Business Combination Agreement contemplates that the
Parties will enter into this Agreement concurrently with the entry into of the
Business Combination Agreement, and that, pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Sponsor shall surrender certain of its equity interests in Parent as of
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and agree to certain covenants
and agreements related to the transactions contemplated by the Business
Combination Agreement.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

 **1. Representations and Warranties**. The Sponsor represents and
warrants to Parent that the following statements are true and correct:

  



  

(a) The Sponsor has the requisite limited liability company power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Sponsor. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Sponsor and
constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Sponsor (assuming this
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
Party), enforceable against the Sponsor in accordance with its terms (subject
to Creditors' Rights).

  



  

(b) The Sponsor is the beneficial owner of 10,206,000 shares of Parent
Class B Common Stock (the " _Founder Shares_ ") as of the date hereof.
Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and prior to the forfeiture of
the Forfeited Securities (as defined below), all of the Forfeited Securities
will be owned by the Sponsor. The Sponsor has, or will have as of the date
hereof and immediately prior to giving effect to the transactions occurring on
the Closing Date, as applicable, valid, good and marketable title to such
Forfeited Securities, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Encumbrances pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement and
transfer restrictions under applicable Law or under the Organizational
Documents of Parent). Except for this Agreement, the Sponsor is not party to
any option, warrant, purchase right, or other contract or commitment that
could require the Sponsor to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the
Forfeited Securities. Neither the Sponsor, nor any transferees of any equity
securities of Parent initially held by the Sponsor, has asserted or perfected
any rights to adjustment or other anti-dilution protections with respect to
any equity securities of Parent (including the Founder Shares) (whether in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination
Agreement or otherwise).

  



  

   

  



  

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Sponsor of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Sponsor of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not: (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of
the Organizational Documents of the Sponsor, (ii) result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both)
a default or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Sponsor is a party or by which its
properties or assets may be bound, (iii) violate any Law of any Governmental
Entity applicable to the Sponsor or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties or assets (including the Founder Shares), as applicable,
or (iv) result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Encumbrances
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement to which it is
subject or bound and transfer restrictions under applicable Law or under the
Organizational Documents of Parent) upon its assets (including the Founder
Shares), except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for
violations which would not reasonably be expected to materially impact, impair
or delay or prevent the ability of the Sponsor to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Sponsor to perform its obligations hereunder.

  



  

 **2. Sponsor Forfeiture**. The Sponsor hereby acknowledges and agrees
that, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Sponsor shall
automatically be deemed to irrevocably transfer to Parent, surrender and
forfeit for no consideration 760,000 Founder Shares (such Founder Shares, the
" _Forfeited Securities_ ") and that from and after such time such Founder
Shares shall be deemed to be cancelled and no longer outstanding.

  



  

 **3. Covenants**.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sponsor
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
_Section _ _2_ of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of the Business Combination Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Sponsor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it shall
not (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge,
grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of,
directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or
liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section
16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, with respect to any Forfeited Securities, (ii) enter into any swap
or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any of the Forfeited Securities or
(iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in
clauses (i) or (ii).

  



  

   

  



  

 **4. Termination**. This Agreement shall terminate, and have no further
force and effect, if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the Closing under the Business Combination
Agreement.

  



  

 **5. Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial**.

  



  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT,
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

  



  

(b) THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF

EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH A DELAWARE FEDERAL OR STATE COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY
CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH
PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF
PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN
THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION_ _6_ OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE
PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF.

  



  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY

 **7. Specific Performance**. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that
may be available to it, including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (on
behalf of itself and the third Party beneficiaries of this Agreement) (a) a
decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. Each Party further agrees that no other
Party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ _7_ , and each Party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

 **8. Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including via facsimile transmission or email in "portable
document format" (".pdf") form, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

  



  

 **9. Amendment**. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  



  

 **10. Assignment**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section
_ _10_ shall be void.

  



  

 **11. Severability**. Each Party agrees that, should any court or other
competent Governmental Entity hold any provision of this Agreement or part
hereof to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such other
term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Except
as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, in response to an order from a
court or other competent Governmental Entity for any Party to take any action
inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or required
hereby, to the extent that a Party hereto took an action inconsistent with
this Agreement or failed to take action consistent with this Agreement or
required by this Agreement pursuant to such order, such Party shall not incur
any liability or obligation unless such Party did not in good faith seek to
resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order.
