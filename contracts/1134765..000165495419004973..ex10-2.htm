jurisdiction of formation and has the requisite power to carry on its
business as now conducted.

 

 

 

 2.2 Capitalization. The authorized equity interests of CCD are as set forth
on Schedule A. All of the issued and outstanding shares of equity interests
of CCD, as of the Closing, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully

retire, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, CCD.

 

 

 

 2.3 Certain Matters. CCD is duly qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be
so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on CCD's financial

body or authority is necessary for the consummation by CCD of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by CCD nor the consummation by CCD of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by CCD with any of the
provisions hereof, will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provisions of the charter or bylaws of CCD, (b) result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or
both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, license, Contract, agreement or other instrument
or obligation to which CCD is a party or by which any of CCD's properties or
assets may be bound, or (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to CCD or any of its properties or
assets, except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) for violations, breaches or

employment of each such executive officer does not subject CCD to any
liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters. CCD is in compliance
with all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating
to employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment
and wages and hours, except where the failure to be in compliance could

thereof and or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and that
Pubco's reliance on such exemption is predicated on such Member's or
Direct Investor's representations set forth herein.

 

 

 

 3.4 Status of Member and Direct Investor. Such Member or Direct Investor
is an "Accredited Investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act, an excerpt of which is included in
the attached Annex A, and such person is not acquiring the Issuable
Securities or Underlying Shares as a result of any advertisement, article,
notice or other communication regarding the Issuable Securities and
Underlying Shares published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media
or broadcast over television or radio or presented at any seminar or any
other general advertisement or, to such Member\'s or Direct Investor\'s
knowledge, general solicitation.

 

 

 

 3.5 Investment Risk. Such Member or Direct Investor is able to bear
the economic risk of acquiring the Issuable Securities and Underlying Shares
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including a complete loss of such
person's investment in the Issuable Securities and Underlying Shares.

 

 

 

 3.6 Restrictive Legends.

 

 

 

 (a) Such Member or Direct Investor acknowledges that the
certificate(s) representing the Issuable Securities and Underlying Shares
shall each conspicuously set forth on the face or back thereof a legend in
substantially the following form:

 

 

 

 "[NEITHER] THIS SECURITY [NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THIS SECURITY
IS [EXERCISABLE] [CONVERTIBLE]] HAS [NOT] BEEN REGISTERED WITH
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY
STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE
OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN
A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS
AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT,
THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. THIS
SECURITY [AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON [EXERCISE] [CONVERSION] OF THIS
SECURITY] MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT WITH
A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT
IS AN "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-8-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 3.6(a), upon the written request of a Direct
Investor, any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 3.6(a)
hereof) on the Issuable Shares held by such Direct Investor may be removed
(i) while a registration statement (including the Registration Statement)
covering the resale of such security is effective under the Securities Act,
(ii) following any sale of such Issuable Shares pursuant to Rule 144, (iii)
if such Issuable Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144 without the
requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1), or (iv) if such legend
is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act
(including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the staff of
the Commission), subject in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv)
to receipt from the Direct Investor by Pubco of customary representations
reasonably acceptable to Pubco in connection with such request. Upon such
request, the Pubco shall (A) deliver to its transfer agent irrevocable
instructions to remove the legend, and (B) cause its counsel to deliver to is
transfer agent one or more legal opinions to the effect that the removal of
such legend in such circumstances may be effected under the Securities Act
if required by its transfer agent, or requested by a Direct Investor, to
effect the removal of the legend in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. Pubco agrees that following the effective date of a registration
statement covering the resale of the Issuable Shares or at such time as such
legend is no longer required under this Section 3.6(b), it will, no later
than two Trading Days following the delivery by a Direct Investor to Pubco or
its transfer agent of a request for legend removal and in the case of
Issuable Shares evidenced by a physical certificate, the delivery of the
physical certificate, and if relying on Rule 144, receipt from the Direct
Investor of customary representations reasonably acceptable to the Pubco in
connection therewith (such second Trading Day, the "Legend Removal Date"),
deliver or cause to be delivered to such Investor, as may be requested by
the Direct Investor, a certificate or book-entry position evidencing such
Issuable Shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends or by
crediting the account of the Direct Investor's or its designee's account with
The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian
system if Pubco or Pubco\'s transfer agent is then a participant in such
system. Pubco may not make any notation on its records or give instructions
to the Transfer Agent that enlarge the restrictions on transfer set forth in
Section 3.6(a).

 

 

 

 (c) If Pubco fails to deliver any such Issuable Shares free from
all restrictive legends on or before the applicable Legend Removal Date and
if after the Legend Removal Date, due to Pubco\'s continuing failure to
deliver such Issuable Shares, such Direct Investor purchases (in an open
market transaction or otherwise) shares of Pubco Common Stock to deliver in
satisfaction of a sale by such Investor of all or any portion of the Issuable
Shares anticipated receiving from Pubco without any restrictive legend, then
Pubco shall pay in cash to the Direct Investor in an amount equal to
the excess of such Direct Investor's total purchase price (including
brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Pubco Common Stock so
purchased (the "Buy-In Price") over the product of (A) such number of shares
of Pubco Common Stock that Pubco was required to deliver to such Direct
Investor by the Legend Removal Date multiplied by (B) any closing sale price
of the Pubco Common Stock selected by the Direct Investor on any Trading Day
during the period commencing on the date of the delivery by such
Direct Investor to Pubco such shares of Pubco Common Stock and ending on the
date of such delivery and payment under this Section 3.6(c).

 

 

 

 (d) Each Direct Investor, severally and not jointly with the other
Direct Investors, agrees with Pubco (i) that such Direct Investor will sell
any Issuable Shares pursuant to either the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements, or
an exemption therefrom, (ii) that if Issuable Shares are sold pursuant to a
registration statement, they will be sold in compliance with the plan
of distribution set forth therein, (iii) that if, after the effective date
of the registration statement covering the resale of the Issuable Shares,
such registration statement ceases to be effective and Pubco has provided
notice to such Direct Investor to that effect, such Direct Investor will sell
Issuable Shares only in compliance with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act; and acknowledges that the removal of
the restrictive legend from the Issuable Shares due to the effectiveness of
a registration statement as set forth in Section 3.6(b) is predicated upon
Pubco\'s reliance upon this Agreement.

 

 

 

 (e) At any time during the period commencing on the six (6)
month anniversary of the Closing Date and ending at such time that all
of the Issuable Shares and Underlying Shares, if a registration statement is
not available for the resale of all of the Underlying Shares, may be sold
without restriction or limitation pursuant to Rule 144 and without the
requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1), if Pubco shall (i) fail
for any reason to satisfy the requirements of Rule 144(c)(1), including,
without limitation, the failure to satisfy the current public information
requirements under Rule 144(c) or (ii) if Pubco has ever been an
issuer described in Rule 144(i)(1)(i) or becomes such an issuer in
the future, and Pubco shall fail to satisfy any condition set forth in Rule
144(i)(2) (each, a "Public Information Failure"), then, as partial relief for
the damages to any Direct Investor by reason of any such delay in
or reduction of its ability to sell the Issuable Shares and
Underlying Shares (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other
remedies available at law or in equity), Pubco shall pay to each such
Direct Investor an amount in cash equal to two percent (2.0%) of
the aggregate Direct Funds of such Direct Investor on the day of a Public
Information Failure and on every thirtieth day (pro-rated for periods
totaling less than thirty days) thereafter until the earlier of (i) the date
such Public Information Failure is cured and (ii) such time that such Public
Information Failure no longer prevents a Direct Investor from selling such
Issuable Securities and Underlying Shares pursuant to Rule 144 without any
restrictions or limitations. The payments to which a holder shall be
entitled pursuant to this Section 3.6(e) are referred to herein as "Public
Information Failure Payments." Public Information Failure Payments shall be
paid on the earlier of (I) the last day of the calendar month during which
such Public Information Failure Payments are incurred and (II) the
third Business Day after the event or failure giving rise to the
Public Information Failure Payments is cured. In the event Pubco fails
to make Public Information Failure Payments in a timely manner, such Public
Information Failure Payments shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per
month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full.

  ARTICLE 4

 

  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PUBCO

 

 

 

 Pubco hereby represents and warrants to CCD and each Member and
Direct Investor as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date
(unless otherwise indicated, or in the Pubco disclosure schedule
attached hereto), as follows:

 

 

 

 4.1 Organization and Qualification. Pubco is an entity duly incorporated
or otherwise organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of State of Nevada, with the requisite power and authority to own and use its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted.
Pubco is not in violation or default of any of the provisions of its articles
of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter documents
(collectively the "Charter Documents"). Pubco is duly qualified to
conduct business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or
other entity in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted or property owned by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing, as the case may be, could not have or reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and no proceeding has been instituted
in any such jurisdiction revoking, limiting or curtailing or seeking to
revoke, limit or curtail such power and authority or qualification.

 

 

 

 4.2 Authorization; Enforcement. Pubco has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into and to consummate this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise to carry out
its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
each of the other Transaction Documents by Pubco and the consummation by it
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary action on the part of Pubco and no further action is
required by Pubco, the Board of Directors or Pubco's stockholders in
connection therewith other than in connection with the Required Approvals, as
defined in Section 4.4. The Transaction Documents have been (or upon
delivery will have been) duly executed by Pubco and, when delivered in
accordance with the terms thereof, will constitute the valid and binding
obligation of Pubco enforceable against Pubco in accordance with their
respective terms, except: (i) as limited by general equitable principles
and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, (ii) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and (iii) insofar
as indemnification and contribution provisions may be limited by applicable
law (the exceptions referenced in the preceding clauses "(i)" through
"(iii)", the "Enforceability Exceptions").

 

 

 

 4.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance by Pubco of the
Transaction Documents and the consummation by Pubco of the transactions
contemplated thereby do not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of Pubco's certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or
other organizational or charter documents (including the certificates of
designation for the Preferred Stock), (ii) conflict with, or constitute a
default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would
become a default) under, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Pubco, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice, lapse of
time or both) of, any agreement, credit facility, debt or other instrument
(evidencing a Pubco debt or otherwise) or other understanding to which Pubco
is a party or by which any property or asset of Pubco is bound or affected,
or (iii) subject to the Required Approvals, as defined by Section 4.4,
conflict with or result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment, injunction, decree or other restriction of any court
or governmental authority to which Pubco is subject (including federal and
state securities laws and regulations), or by which any property or asset of
Pubco is bound or affected; except in the case of each of clauses (ii) and
(iii), such as could not have or reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

 4.4 Filings, Consents and Approvals. Pubco is not required to obtain
any consent, waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make
any filing or registration with, any court or other federal, state, local or
other governmental authority or other Person in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by Pubco of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, other than the filing of Current Report(s) on Form 8-K
with the SEC and such filings as are required to be made under applicable
federal and state securities laws relating to the offer and sale of
securities (collectively, the "Required Approvals").

 

 

 

 4.5  The Issuable Securities and Underlying Shares. The Issuable Shares
are duly authorized and, when issued and acquired in accordance with
this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable, free and clear of all Liens imposed on or by Pubco other than
restrictions on transfer provided for in this Agreement. The Issuable
Warrants are duly authorized and, when issued and acquired in accordance with
this Agreement, will constitute the valid and binding obligations of Pubco
enforceable against Pubco in accordance with their respective terms subject,
in the case of enforceability, to the Enforceability Exceptions. Except as
set forth on Schedule 4.5, the Underlying Shares are duly authorized and
reserved and, when issued and acquired in accordance with the terms of
the Issuable Securities, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, free and clear of all Liens imposed on or by Pubco other than
restrictions on transfer provided for in this Agreement or the Issuable
Securities.

 

 

 

 4.6 Capitalization. The capitalization of Pubco is as set forth on Schedule
4.6, which Schedule 4.6 shall also include the number of shares of Pubco
Common Stock owned beneficially, and of record, by Affiliates of Pubco as of
the date hereof, if any. Other than as set forth in Schedule 4.6, Pubco has
no authorized or issued shares of any class of capital stock. No Person has
any right of first refusal, preemptive right, right of participation, or
any similar right to participate in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.6, there are no outstanding
options, warrants, scrip rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any
character whatsoever relating to, or securities, rights or obligations
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or giving any Person any
right to subscribe for or acquire any shares of Pubco Common Stock, or
Contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which Pubco or
any subsidiary of Pubco is or may become bound to issue additional shares of
Pubco Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents. Schedule 4.6 contains the
terms of any Common Stock Equivalents, including conversion and exercise
prices, maturity or termination dates, anti-dilution and reset provisions.
The issuance of the Issuable Securities will not obligate Pubco to issue
shares of Pubco Common Stock or other securities to any Person and will not
result in a right of any holder of Pubco securities to adjust the
exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under any of such
securities. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.6, all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Pubco are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, have been issued in compliance with all federal and state
securities laws, and none of such outstanding shares was issued in violation
of any preemptive rights or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase
securities. No further approval or authorization of any stockholder or
Pubco's board of directors is required for the issuance of the Issuable
Securities or Underlying Shares. There are no stockholders agreements,
voting agreements or other similar agreements with respect to Pubco's
capital stock to which Pubco is a party or, to the Knowledge of Pubco,
between or among any of Pubco's stockholders.

foregoing materials, including the exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, being collectively referred
to herein as the "SEC Reports", and the SEC Reports set forth on
Schedule 4.7 hereto being collectively referred to herein as the "Delinquent
SEC Reports"). As of their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The financial statements of Pubco included in the
SEC Reports ("SEC Financial Statements") comply in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing. Such
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
as may be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes
thereto and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain all
footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the
financial position of Pubco as of and for the dates thereof and the results
of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments.

financial statements included within the SEC Reports, except as
specifically disclosed in a subsequent SEC Report filed five days prior to
the date hereof: (i) there has been no event, occurrence or development that
has had or that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) Pubco has not incurred any Liabilities (contingent or otherwise)

any request for confidential treatment of information. Except for the
issuance of the Issuable Securities contemplated by this Agreement or as
set forth on Schedule 4.8, no event, liability or development has occurred
or exists with respect to Pubco or any subsidiary of Pubco or
their respective business, properties, operations or financial
condition, that would be required to be disclosed by Pubco under
applicable securities laws at the time this representation is made or
deemed made that has not been publicly disclosed at least one (1)
Trading Day prior to the date that this representation is made.

 

 

 

 4.9 Litigation. There are no actions, suits, arbitrations, regulatory
proceedings or other litigation, proceedings or governmental
investigations pending or, to the Best Knowledge of Pubco, threatened
against Pubco or any of its officers or directors in their capacity as such,
or any of its properties or businesses, and Pubco has no Knowledge of any
facts or circumstances which may reasonably be likely to give rise to any of
the foregoing. Pubco is not subject to any order, judgment, decree,
injunction, stipulation or consent order of or with any court or other
Governmental Authority. Pubco has not entered into any agreement to settle or
compromise any proceeding pending or threatened in writing against it which
has involved any obligation for which Pubco has any continuing obligation.
There are no claims, actions, suits, proceedings, or investigations pending
or, to the Best Knowledge of Pubco, threatened by or against Pubco with
respect to this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Pubco has no reason to believe there is a valid
basis for any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

 

 

 4.10 Labor Relations. No labor dispute exists or, to the Knowledge
of Pubco, is imminent with respect to any of the employees of Pubco which
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of
Pubco's employees is a member of a union that relates to such employee's
relationship with Pubco, and Pubco is not a party to a collective bargaining
agreement, and Pubco believes that its relationships with their employees are
good. No executive officer, to the Knowledge of Pubco, is, or is
now expected to be, in violation of any material term of any
employment contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary
information agreement or non-competition agreement, or any other Contract
or agreement or any restrictive covenant in favor of any third party, and
the continued employment of each such executive officer does not subject
Pubco to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters. Pubco is
in compliance with all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations relating to employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where the failure to be
in compliance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-12-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 4.11 Compliance. To the Knowledge of Pubco, Pubco: (i) is not in default
under or in violation of (and no event has occurred that has not been
waived that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would result in a default
by Pubco under), nor has Pubco received notice of a claim that it is in
default under or that it is in violation of, any indenture, loan or credit
agreement or any other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its properties is bound (whether or not such default or
violation has been waived), (ii) is not in violation of any order of any
court, arbitrator or governmental body, or (iii) except for the failure
to file the Delinquent SEC Reports, is not and has not been in violation of
any statute, rule or regulation of any governmental authority, including
without limitation all foreign, federal, state and local laws applicable to
its business and all such laws that affect the environment, except in each
case as could not have or reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 4.12 Regulatory Permits. Pubco possesses all certificates,
authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate federal, state, local
or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct its business, except
where the failure to possess such permits could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect ("Material Permits"), and Pubco has not
received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification
of any Material Permit.

 

 

 

 4.13 Title to Assets. Pubco has good and marketable title in all personal
property owned by it that is material to the business of Pubco, free and
clear of all Liens, except for Liens disclosed on Schedule 4.13 or that do
not materially affect the value of such property and do not materially
interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by Pubco
and Liens for the payment of Taxes, the payment of which is neither
delinquent nor subject to penalties. Pubco does not own any real property.
Any real property and facilities held under lease by Pubco are held by Pubco
under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with which Pubco is
in compliance.

 

 

 

 4.14 Patents and Trademarks. Pubco has, or has rights to use, all patents,
patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, trade
names, trade secrets, inventions, copyrights, licenses and other intellectual
property rights and similar rights described on Schedule 4.14 (collectively,
the "Pubco Intellectual Property Rights"). Other than the Pubco Intellectual
Property Rights, there are no intellectual property or similar
rights necessary or material for use in connection with Pubco's business and
which the failure to so have could have a Material Adverse Effect. Pubco has
not received a notice (written or otherwise) that any of the Pubco
Intellectual Property Rights used by Pubco violates or infringes upon the
rights of any Person. To the Knowledge of Pubco, all such Pubco Intellectual
Property Rights are enforceable and there is no existing infringement by
another Person of any of the Intellectual Property Rights. Pubco has
taken reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality
and value of all of their intellectual properties, except where failure to do
so could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 4.15 Transactions with Affiliates and Employees. Except as set forth
on Schedule 4.15, none of the officers or directors of Pubco and, to the
Knowledge of Pubco, none of the employees of Pubco is presently a party to

and directors), including any Contract, agreement or other arrangement
providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for rental of
real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or
from any officer, director or such employee or, to the Knowledge of Pubco,
any entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a
substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner, in
each case in excess of $10,000 individually or $25,000 in the
aggregate, other than for: (i) payment of salary or consulting fees
for services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of
Pubco and (iii) other employee benefits.

 

 

 

 4.16 Sarbanes-Oxley; Internal Accounting Controls. Pubco is in
material compliance with all provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 which are applicable to it as of the Closing Date. Pubco maintains a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. Pubco has established
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for Pubco and designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Pubco
in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms. Pubco's certifying officers have evaluated the
effectiveness of Pubco's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by Pubco's most recently filed periodic report under
the Exchange Act (such date, the "Evaluation Date"). Pubco presented in its
most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act the conclusions of
the certifying officer about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures based on their evaluations as of the Evaluation Date. Since the
Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Pubco's internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
Pubco's internal control over financial reporting.

 4.17 Certain Fees. No brokerage or finder's fees or commissions are or
will be payable by Pubco to any broker, financial advisor or consultant,
finder, placement agent, investment banker, bank or other Person with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 4.18 Issuance of Issuable Securities and Underlying Shares. Assuming
the accuracy of the Members' and Direct Investors' representations and
warranties set forth in Article 3, no registration under the Securities Act
is required for the offer and issuance of the Issuable Securities and

  ARTICLE 5

 

  INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

 

 

 

 5.1 Indemnification.

 

 

 

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article 5, and irrespective of any
due diligence investigation conducted by CCD, the Members or Direct
Investors with regard to the transactions contemplated hereby, Pubco agrees
to indemnify fully in respect of, hold harmless and defend CCD, the Members
and Direct Investors, and each of the officers, agents and directors of CCD
and/or the Members and Direct Investors against any damages, liabilities,
costs, claims, proceedings, investigations, penalties, judgments,
deficiencies, including taxes, expenses (including, but not limited to, any
and all interest, penalties and expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred
in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced
or threatened, or any claim whatsoever) and losses (each, a "Claim"
and collectively "Claims") to which it or they may become subject arising
out of or based on any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations
and warranties or covenants or conditions made by Pubco in this Agreement.

 

 

 

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Article 5, CCD and each
Member agrees to indemnify fully in respect of, hold harmless and
defend Pubco and each of its officers, agents and directors against
any Claims to which they may become subject arising out of or based on any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties or
covenants or conditions made by CCD and/or any Member and in this Agreement;
provided that CCD shall have no responsibility hereunder except for
representations, warranties, covenants or conditions made by it and no Member
have any responsibility hereunder except for representations,
warranties, covenants or conditions made by it; and further provided that
the liability of any Member shall not exceed the value on the Closing Date
of the consideration received by it hereunder.

 

 

 

 5.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the representations and
warranties given or made by Pubco, CCD and the Members and Direct Investors
under this Agreement shall survive the date hereof for a period of forty-
eight (48) months from and after the Closing Date (the last day of such
period is herein referred to as the "Expiration Date"), except that any
written claim for breach thereof made and delivered prior to the Expiration
Date to the party against whom such indemnification is sought shall
survive thereafter and, as to any such claim, such applicable
expiration will not effect the rights to indemnification of the party
making such claim; provided, however, that any representations
and warranties that were fraudulently made shall not expire on
the Expiration Date and shall survive indefinitely and claims with respect
to fraud by Pubco, CCD, the Members or Direct Investors must be made at any
time, as long as such claim is made within a reasonable period of time after
discovery by the claiming party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-16-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 5.3 Method of Asserting Claims, Etc. The party claiming indemnification is
hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnified Party" and the party against whom
such claims are asserted hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party." All Claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party
under this Article 5 shall be asserted as follows:

 

 

 

 (a) In the event that any Claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party would be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against
or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a third party, said
Indemnified Party shall, within ten (10) business days from the date upon
which the Indemnified Party has Knowledge of such Claim, notify the
Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of and
specific basis for such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated
amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Claim or demand) (the "Claim Notice").
The Indemnified Party's failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of liability hereunder unless such failure materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the claim or
demand. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the giving of the
Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party: (i)
whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the liability of the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such
Claim or demand, and (ii) whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires,
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend
the Indemnified Party against such Claims or demand; provided, however, that
any Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice
Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading which he shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect his interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that he, she or it does not dispute liability for
indemnification under this Article 5 and that such person desires to defend
the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand and except as hereinafter
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly settled or
prosecuted by him to a final conclusion. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Party except to the extent that the employment
thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party
in writing, the Indemnifying Party has failed after a reasonable period of
time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or in such action there is,
in the reasonable opinion of such separate counsel, a material conflict on
any material issue between the position of the Indemnifying Party and the
position of such Indemnified Party (a "Material Conflict"). If requested by
the Indemnifying Party and there is no Material Conflict, the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and his, her or its
counsel in contesting any Claim or demand which the Indemnifying Party elects
to contest or, if appropriate and related to the Claim in question, in making
any Counterclaim against the person asserting the third party Claim or
demand, or any cross-complaint against any person. No Claim for
which indemnity is sought hereunder and for which the Indemnifying Party has
acknowledged liability for indemnification under this Article 5 may
be settled without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

 

 (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a Claim against
any Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a Claim or demand
being asserted against or sought to be collected from him by a third party,
the Indemnified Party shall give a Claim Notice with respect to such Claim to
the Indemnifying Party. If, after receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that he,
she or it disputes such Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have admitted liability for such Claim in the amount set forth in the
Claim Notice.

 

 

 

 (c) The Indemnifying Party shall be given the opportunity to defend
the respective Claim.

 6.5 Notice of Default. From the date hereof through the Closing,
each party hereto shall give to the representative of the other
parties prompt written notice of the occurrence or existence of any
event, condition or circumstance occurring which would constitute
