AGREEMENT

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows: ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consummate the
Merger pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease, (b) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the
Merger and (c) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of
Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, MA 02110, on the second
(2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions)
set forth in _Article VI_ , or another time, date or place as is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "
_Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, the Certificate of Merger shall be
delivered for filing with the Delaware Secretary. The Merger shall become
effective at the Effective Time.

 

Section 1.4 _Conversion of the Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Except as provided in  _Section 1.4(b)_, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Dissenter Shares) shall be cancelled and shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted
automatically into the right to receive $19.25 in cash, without interest
thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock as provided in _Article II_.
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a Certificate theretofore representing such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted, as provided herein.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company (or any
Subsidiary of the Company) as treasury stock or otherwise and each share of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



2 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split,
combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and
to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be the same as
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that such Certificate of Incorporation shall (i)
be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Imprivata,
Inc." and (ii) comply with _Section 5.9(a)_. Thereafter, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may only be amended in accordance
with its terms, _Section 5.9_ and as provided by Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(except that (i) all references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to refer to "Imprivata, Inc." and (ii) such
Bylaws shall comply with  _Section 5.9(a)_). Thereafter, the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation may only be amended or repealed in accordance with their
terms and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided by Law.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Company
shall cause to be delivered to Parent, at the Closing, resignations of all
the directors of the Company to be effective upon the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company
shall continue in office as the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall hold office in
accordance with and subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.7 _Company Compensatory Awards; ESPP_.

 

(a) _Termination of Company Equity Incentive Plans_. Except as otherwise
agreed to by the parties hereto in writing, (i) the Company Equity Incentive
Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the 

 



3  capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be cancelled as
of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the
Effective Time no participant in the Company Equity Incentive Plans or other
plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any
equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof.

 

(b) _Company Common Stock Options_. Immediately prior to, and contingent upon
the consummation of, the Closing, each unvested Company Common Stock Option
shall immediately vest and become exercisable. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Common Stock Option (including those subject to
acceleration pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence), shall be
cancelled, (i) in the case of a Company Common Stock Option having a per share
exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, for the right to receive
from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash (without
interest thereon) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (B) the amount by which the Merger Consideration
exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Common Stock Option, and
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders
of such Company Common Stock Options such amount as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 2.1_, or (ii) in the case of
any Company Common Stock Option having a per share exercise price equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, without the payment of cash or issuance
of other securities in respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Common
Stock Option as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had
in respect of such Company Common Stock Option. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Common Stock Options
notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase
rights thereon shall lapse and all such shares of Company Restricted Stock
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive at the Effective
Time an amount in cash (without interest thereon) in dollars equal to the
product of (i) the total number of such shares of Company Restricted Stock
without regard to vesting and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall
become fully vested and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest thereon) in
dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares underlying
such award of Company RSUs and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 



4 (e) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Compensatory Awards. On the Closing Date,
the applicable holders of Company Compensatory Awards will receive a payment
from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or
payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in
respect of such Company Compensatory Awards that are cancelled and converted
pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_, _Section 1.7(c)_ or _Section 1.7(d)_, as
applicable. All such payments will be less any applicable withholding Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company
Compensatory Awards pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_, _Section 1.7(c)_ or
_Section 1.7(d)_ as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, less
any applicable withholding Taxes, which check will be sent by overnight
courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter).

(f) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the ESPP: (i)
each individual participating in an Offering (as defined in the ESPP) in
progress as of the date hereof (the " _Final Offering_ ") shall not be
permitted (x) to increase the amount of his or her rate of
payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect when the Final
Offering commenced or (y) to make separate non-payroll contributions to the
ESPP on or following the date hereof, (ii) no individual who is not
participating in the ESPP as of the date hereof may commence participation in
the ESPP following the date hereof, (iii) the Final Offering shall end on (and
the final Exercise Date (as defined in the ESPP) shall be) the earlier to
occur of August 31, 2016 and a date that is five (5) calendar days prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "), (iv) each ESPP
participants accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, (v) the ESPP shall terminate on the
date immediately prior to the date of the Effective Time and no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter and (vi) no new
Offering periods shall be commenced after the date hereof. _Section 1.7(f)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) as of July 8, 2016 and (y) the
Companys reasonable estimate as of August 31, 2016: (A) the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased under the ESPP, and (B) the
aggregate purchase price for such shares under the ESPP (in each case assuming
for this purpose that the Merger Consideration is the Fair Market Value of
the Common Stock (as defined in the ESPP) of Company Common Stock on the
Exercise Date (as defined in the ESPP) and assuming the Exercise Date is July
8, 2016 or August 31, 2016, as applicable), as determined in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence. All shares of Company Common Stock
purchased on the Final Exercise Date shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



5 Section 1.8 _Dissenter Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the "fair
value" of its Dissenter Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such
Dissenter Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section
1.8_) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenter Shares, in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make (or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of
fair value of Dissenter Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all (but not control any)
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL) or lost the right to dissent, then as of the
later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the Dissenter
Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall be cancelled and converted
into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Section 1.8_. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenter
Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other
rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of
Parent.

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_ , through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S.
dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for payments in
respect of Company Compensatory Awards, which shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 1.7(e)_). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_
 that: (a) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and (b) such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable pursuant to _Article I_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by Parent. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



6 Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but
in no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time),
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ,"
it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be
deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent or
holders of Dissenter Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their
rights of appraisal) (a) a letter of transmittal in customary form and with
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably determine (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as
may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares
are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a
book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry
account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Article II_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the
shares represented thereby as contemplated by _Section 1.8_.

 

Section 2.3 _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such Merger Consideration was paid.

 

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any Company Common Stockholders who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, as unsecured creditors.

 



7 Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Company Common Stockholder for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 2.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

 

Section 2.7 _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on
or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

Section 2.8  _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Common Stock Options and/or
Company Restricted Stock such amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and withheld amounts are paid
over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law
or Order, then for all purposes of this Agreement such amounts shall be
treated as having been paid to the former holder of a Certificate or Company
Common Stock Option in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

designed to ensure that the Companys management is timely alerted to
material information required to be included in the Companys periodic

cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things

contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, the Transaction
Documents.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to make promptly (and in any event
no later than five (5) Business Days following the date hereof) any required
submissions under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law that the Company and
Parent determines should be made, in each case with respect to the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether

permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any
foreign Law or regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or
other Contracts material to the Companys business in connection with the
consummation

 



42  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) in promptly
making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits,

Act and any other Antitrust Law. Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with
one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any suit,
claim, action, investigation or proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law. Each of the Company and Parent will permit

submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such legal
proceeding. Parent shall pay all required filing fees in connection with the
performance of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub under this _Section 5.3_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to, nor shall the Company (without the
consent of Parent, which may be withheld in Parents sole discretion, provided
Parent has otherwise complied with the requirements of this _Section 5.3_),
negotiate, commit to or effect by Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto or enter into
any Order, accept any undertaking or condition or otherwise take or commit to
take actions that would limit Parents, the Companys or their respective
Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, any of
their businesses, product lines or assets, or otherwise limit Parents or its
Affiliates ability to receive the full benefits of this Agreement (each, a "
_Regulatory Action_ "), if such Regulatory Action would, in each case, have a
material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on Parent, the
Company, and their Affiliates combined. In no event shall Parent or Merger Sub
be required to (nor will the Company, without Parents consent, which may be
withheld at Parents sole discretion) pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any
Contract.

 

(d) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other, shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) notify
the other party in writing if it believes that such party has breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result
in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ if
continuing on the Closing Date.

 



43 (e) If any Antitakeover Law is or may become applicable to the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) shall promptly grant such
approvals and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other lawful
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take such other commercially
reasonable and lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions.

(f) Subject to  _Section 5.3_, in the event that any litigation or other
Action is commenced by a Governmental Entity challenging the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such litigation or Action
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent consummation of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such litigation or Action and each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in good faith with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest any such
litigation or Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Prior to the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent
shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, acquire or enter into a
definitive written agreement to acquire any Person set forth in _Section
5.3(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, if such acquisition would reasonably
be expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.4 _Proxy_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the

respond as promptly as practicable to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after
it receives notice 

 



44  thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of the Company Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to filing
or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in
each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments
of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and will give
due consideration to all reasonable comments proposed by Parent. As promptly
as practicable after the clearance (which shall include upon expiration of the
ten (10) day period after filing in the event the SEC does not review the
Proxy Statement) of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (the " _SEC Clearance Date_
"), the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and, if necessary in order
to comply with applicable securities Law, after the Proxy Statement shall have
been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

(c) _Information Supplied_. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to it
and its Affiliates and Representatives, that none of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent or the Company, as applicable, expressly for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any other
documents filed or to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, will, as of the time such documents (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are mailed to the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that all documents that
such party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Merger will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any
other applicable Law and will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting, any event or circumstance relating to Parent or Merger Sub, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent that should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent
shall promptly inform the Company and, if requested by Parent, the Company
shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose such event
or circumstance. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any event
or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall promptly inform Parent and, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose
such event or circumstance. Without limitation of the foregoing, if at any
time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any event shall occur that is required
by applicable Law to be described in the Proxy Statement, such event shall be
so described, and an amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, as required by Law, disseminated to the Company Common Stockholders.

required to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting by an Order or a
request from the SEC or its staff or (z) to ensure that any necessary

Required Vote. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent,
advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business

the stockholders set forth on _Section 5.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure

substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to any questions from such stockholders
regarding the Voting Agreement, including by permitting Parent to discuss the
Voting Agreement with such stockholders directly.

than to refer to this Agreement) or negotiations regarding, or provide any
non-public information or data concerning, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or personnel of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal;

(iii) approve, endorse, recommend or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

The Company represents and warrants that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract containing a standstill or similar
obligation of a third party to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
does not terminate in accordance with its terms in connection with public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.6(a)_,

books, records, or to any personnel of the Company in response to a request
therefor to a Third Party (and its Representatives and financing sources) who
has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof
that

 



47  was not solicited in material violation of this _Section 5.6_ if and only
if, prior to providing such information, the Company has received from such
Third Party so requesting such information an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
provided to such Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal that is given

Representatives; or

 

(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with a Third
Party who has made such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal;

or  _Section 5.6(b)(ii)_, (A) the Company Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) the Company
Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) shall have determined in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_
, that the Company and its Representatives may contact such Third Party to
clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal prior to making
any such determinations.

 

(c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 5.6(d)_, _Section 5.6(e)_ or

adopt, approve or recommend to the Company Common Stockholders an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) fail to make a Required Reaffirmation within seven (7) Business

previously made a Required Reaffirmation on two (2) or more occasions or
within the thirty (30) days immediately preceding such request; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such failure shall not be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if there shall not have been, at the time of such
request, a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal that has not been
withdrawn, (D) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal or (E) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action 

 



48  described in clauses (A) through (E), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the
determination by the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) that
an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (2) the delivery
by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by _Section 5.6(d)_ will
in and of itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, if the Company has
received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is
not withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof) concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, then (x) the
Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal, or (y)
the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if:

 

(i) the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 5.6_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

(iii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect
that the Company Board of Directors has received a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board of
Directors (or a committee thereof) concludes in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has
resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, which notice shall
specify the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
termination, including the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal
and the material terms thereof (including copies of all material documents
relating to the Superior Proposal, including, for the avoidance of doubt, a
copy of the proposed merger agreement); and

 

(A) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause their financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 

 



49  so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that in the event of any material revisions to the
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors has determined to be
a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.6_
(including this _Section 5.6(d)_) with respect to such new written notice;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Notice Period with respect to such new
written notice shall expire upon the end of the second (2nd) Business Day
after the delivery of such new written notice; and

(B) any such termination shall be in accordance with  _Section 7.1(_e),
including the payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.2(b)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board of
Directors (or a committee thereof) may, in response to a material development
or change in material circumstances not relating to any Acquisition Proposal,
which development or change first occurred or arose after the date hereof and
the existence and material consequences of which development or change were
not known by the Company Board of Directors at or prior to the date hereof
(such material development or change in circumstances, an "
_Intervening Event_ "), make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the
Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that,
in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board of
Directors to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that
the Company Board of Directors shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
5.6(e)_ unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer
than four (3) Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting, in which case
such notice shall be given as promptly as practicable prior to the
Stockholders Meeting), which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) during such
three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening Event.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal or this Agreement, including taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Company
Common Stockholders), _provided_ that the Company shall not effect or disclose
pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position that constitutes a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless otherwise specifically permitted
by this _Section 5.6_, (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act, or (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.6.

 



50 (g) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, or any non-public
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives
from or by, respectively, any Third Party indicating, in connection with such
notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer or
proposal, and a summary of the material terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals
or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis or upon Parents reasonable request,
of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and any material change in the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

 

(h) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes any
action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material breach of
this _Section 5.6_, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this
_Section 5.6_.

 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent,
and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement without the prior consent of the other parties
hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ that (i) a party hereto may, without the prior consent of the
other parties hereto, issue such press release or make such public statement
as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of the NYSE if it
has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
parties hereto and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so
prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to be
issued or made, (ii) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such
consultation with respect to communication that are (1) principally directed
to employees, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications
are consistent with previous releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved
by the other party), or (2) relating to a Superior Proposal, Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act.

Section 5.8 _Litigation_. Without limiting the obligations of the parties
hereto in _Section 5.3_, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking
damages or other relief arising out of or as a result of, the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
including seeking to have any Order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents entered by any court or other

 



51  Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed (" _Transaction Litigation_
"); _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent the right to review and
comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in
connection with any Transaction Litigation, and the right to consult on the
settlement with respect to such Transaction Litigation, and the Company will
in good faith take such comments into account;  _provided_ _further_ _that_
the Company shall not settle or compromise any Transaction Litigation without
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed). Following the Effective Time, the Company
and Indemnified Persons may continue to retain counsel of their choice
retained prior to the Effective Time to defend any Transaction Litigation.

indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between such Indemnified Persons and the Company,
the DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
in the case of advancement of expenses, any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay
such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation,
advancement and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as those contained in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior

Company, unless such a modification is required by Law.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in

and omissions as directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company
occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof
in the form delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof (the "
_Existing D andO Policy_"), to the extent that directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; _provided_ that: (i)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO
Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail"
insurance policy; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay aggregate premiums over such six (6) years for the Existing DandO Policy (or
for any substitute or "tail" policies) in excess of 300% of the amount of the
current annual premium of the Existing DandO Policy.

 



52 (c) The rights set forth in this _Section 5.9_ are in addition to, and not
in limitation of, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, enforce and honor, to the fullest extent permitted by Law for a period of
six (6) years from the Effective Time, the rights otherwise available to the
current officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Law,
charter, bylaw or Contract, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their Representatives.

 

(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 5.10 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.

 

Section 5.11 _Delisting_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with
each other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist
the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate registration under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall not be
effective until or immediately after the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.12 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article VII_ , the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent, and to cause
its Representatives to provide or cause to be provided to Parent, on a
reasonably timely basis and at Parents sole expense, customary cooperation

case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of such earlier date). The Company shall have received a
certificate signed by an executive officer of Parent on its behalf to the
foregoing effect.

available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or results in, the failure of the Merger to
occur on or before such date;

(g) by Parent, if (i) there has been a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a failure of a

(h) by the Company, if (i) there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement that would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ if continuing

breach (A) shall not have been cured before the Termination Date, (B) is not

this _Section 7.1(h)_ if such breach by Parent or Merger Sub is so cured);
_provided_ that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(h)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this
Agreement; or

 

(i) by Parent (if Parent and Merger Sub are not in material breach of their
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under this Agreement),
if the Company shall have breached any of its obligations under _Section 5.6_
(No Solicitation of Transactions) (other than (y) any unauthorized or
materially cured breaches thereof or (z) any immaterial or inadvertent
breaches thereof not intended to result in an Acquisition Proposal).

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to subsection _(b)_ ,
_(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ or (i) of this _Section 7.1_
shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance
with  _Section 8.2_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant
to which such termination is effected. The right of any party hereto to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
by or on behalf of any party hereto, or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.2 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _Expense Allocation_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction Documents, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such fee or expense whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 

(b) _Company Termination Fee_. If:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) _Section 7.1(c)_ (No
Vote) or (y) _Section 7.1(g)_ (Company Breach) due to a willful breach by
the Company, (B) prior to the Stockholders Meeting an Acquisition Proposal was
announced, or otherwise made publicly known, and not withdrawn or abandoned
and (C) within twelve (12) months following the Stockholders Meeting, the
Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal with a Third Party (for purposes
of this subsection, each reference to 20% in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be replaced with 50%);

(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d) (Superior
Proposal);

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ (Adverse
Recommendation); or

 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ (Breach of No
Solicitation).

 



61 then the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Company Termination
Fee (I) in the case of  _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, substantially concurrently with
the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, (II) in the case of _Section
7.2(b)(ii)_, concurrently with such termination or (III) in the case of 
_Section 7.2(b)(iii)_ or _Section 7.2(b)(iv)_, within two (2) Business Days
after such termination, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified in writing by Parent. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid,
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) _Sole Remedy_. If the Company becomes obligated to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 7.2(b)_, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that Parents right to receive the Company Termination Fee from the Company
shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy against the
Company and the Company Group and, upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee, neither the Company nor any member of the Company Group shall have any
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby

(d) _Acknowledgment_. The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the agreements
contained in this  _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable
are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ are not a penalty but rather
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(iii) without the agreements contained in this  _Section 7.2_, the parties
hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company,
except that the provisions of _Section 5.12(c)_, _Section 7.1_, _Section
7.2_, this _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ (and the defined terms referenced
therein) shall survive such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party from any liability for any intentional and material
breach of this Agreement or intentional fraud. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
any failure of Parent to cause the Closing to be effected in accordance with
_Section 1.2_ following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) will be deemed to constitute an intentional and
material breach of a covenant of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
in writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
before or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary; _provided_
that, after the Company Required Vote shall have been obtained,

 



62  no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made that by Law
requires the further approval of the Company Common Stockholders without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented
or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
all of the parties hereto.

 

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (iii) subject to the provisions of _Section 7.4_, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party hereto against whom the waiver is to be
effective. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no modification,
waiver or termination of Section 7.3, _Section 8.5(a)_, _Section
8.6(b)_, Section 8.10, _Section 8.11_ and this sentence of _Section 7.5_
(and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) prior to the Closing that is adverse to the interests
of any Debt Financing Source, in its capacity as such, will be effective
against such Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of either
such Debt Financing Source or of one of its affiliates or Representatives
party to Parents debt commitment letter.

Section 8.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, headings and
index of defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the word "include," "includes" or "including" is used in
this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) the
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereby" refer to this Agreement, (ii) words
using the singular or plural form also include the plural or

 



64  singular form, respectively and (iii) words of any gender include each other
gender. The Company Disclosure Letter, as well as any schedules thereto and
any exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in
any reference to this Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if." References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns. References to "$" and "dollars" are to the
currency of the United States. All references to "days" shall be to calendar
days unless otherwise indicated as a "Business Day."

Section 8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.

 

Section 8.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Reliance_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to
herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement) (i) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and (ii) is not intended to and does not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, other than (i) the Indemnified Persons intended to benefit from the
provisions of _Section 5.9_, and (ii) the Debt Financing Sources with
respect to Section 7.3, the last sentence of Section 7.5, this _Section
8.5(a)_, _Section 8.6(b)_, _Section 8.10_ and _Section 8.11_, in each case,
who shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly.

(b) Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in  _Article III_ (including the Company Disclosure
Letter), and _Article IV_ of this Agreement, neither the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub makes any other representations or warranties and each hereby
disclaims any other representations or warranties made by itself or any of
its Representatives, with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to any other party or any other
partys Representatives of any document or other information with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing, including, in the case of the Company, any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
future business, operations or affairs of the Company or its Subsidiaries
heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent.

Section 8.6 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in
contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof,
shall be governed by and

 



65  construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. The parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
New Castle County, Delaware (or, if (and only if) the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware shall be unavailable, any other court of the State
of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the federal courts have
exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware) and hereby waive the right to
assert the lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue
in connection with any such suit, action, or other proceeding. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each of the parties (i) waives the defense of inconvenient
forum, (ii) agrees not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby other
than in any such court, and (iii) agrees that a final judgment in any such
suit, action, or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of any
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action relating
to the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery
of copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this _Section 8.6(a)_
shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
party hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any
proceeding before any Governmental Entity of any kind or description, whether
at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to Parents Debt Financing or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than the United States Federal and New York State courts located in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York County, State of New York and (ii) agrees that,
except as specifically set forth in Parents debt commitment letter, all
claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement, Parents Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, construed
and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

Section 8.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ that (i) prior to the Closing,
Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided such
Subsidiary of Parent is a Delaware corporation and that such assignment shall
not impair, delay or prevent the

 



66  consummation of the Merger, (ii) at or after the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub may assign this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any
lender providing financing to Parent and (iii) after the Effective Time,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may assign this Agreement, including any
or all rights, interests or obligations hereunder, to any Person, including in
connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. No assignment by any party hereto shall relieve such
party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 8.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which money damages may not be an adequate remedy would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder
to consummate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other applicable remedies at
law or equity, the parties and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, without proof of
damages, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance, or other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. Nothing in this _Section 8.8_ shall
require the Company to seek (or limit the Companys right to seek) specific
performance under this _Section 8.8_ prior to or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under  _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the exercise of the Companys right to seek specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 8.8_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 8.8_ reduce, restrict, or otherwise limit the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ or pursue all applicable
remedies at law, including seeking money damages. Each of the parties hereto
hereby waives (x) the defense that monetary damages would be an adequate
remedy in an action for specific performance and (y) any requirement under any
Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief. In addition to the rights of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled, at their sole election, to settle claims
arising from or relating to this Agreement by consummating the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remaining terms and provision hereof. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid,
legal and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable term.

 



67 Section 8.10 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_Section 8.10_.

 

Section 8.11 _Provision Regarding Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and each other
Company Related Party hereby waives any claims against the Debt Financing
Sources, in its capacity as such, relating in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and hereby agrees that in no event shall the
Debt Financing Sources, in their capacities as such, have any liability or
obligation to the Company or any other Company Related Party under or arising
out of this Agreement, Parents Debt Financing or the debt commitment letter
with respect thereto or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Form of Voting Agreement

[See Attached] VOTING AGREEMENT

 

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
July 13, 2016, by and between Project Brady Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Parent_ "), and the undersigned stockholder (" _Holder_
") of Imprivata, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

RECITALS

Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, Project Brady Merger Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), and the Company, Merger Sub is merging with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") and the Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, will
thereby become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Concurrently with
the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent
has required that Holder enter into this Agreement. Holder is the beneficial
owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of such number
of shares of the outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company as is indicated beneath Holders signature on the last page of this
Agreement (the " _Shares_ "), _provided_ that Shares subsequently transferred
as permitted by, and in accordance with, _Section 1(b)_ below shall, from and
after such transfer, cease to be considered "Shares" under this Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT

The parties agree as follows:

1\. _Agreement to Retain Shares_.

 

(a) _Transfer_. During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on
the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the Expiration Date
(as defined in _Section 5_), (1) except as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, pursuant to the terms of any applicable Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in
existence on the date of this Agreement and except as provided in _Section
1(b)_, Holder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, exchange
or otherwise dispose of (including by merger, consolidation or otherwise by
operation of law) the Shares or any New Shares (as defined below), and (2)
Holder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, grant any proxies or powers of
attorney, deposit any of the Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement with respect to any of the Shares, or enter into any agreement or
arrangement providing for any of the actions described in this clause (2)
(other than as required to comply with _Section 2(a)_).

 

(b) _Permitted Transfers_. _Section 1(a)_ shall not prohibit a transfer of
Shares or New Shares (as defined below) by Holder to (i) any family member or
trust for the benefit of any family member, (ii) any charitable trust, (iii)
stockholder, member or partner of any Holder which is an entity, (iv) any
Affiliate of Holder or (v) any person or entity if and to the extent required
by any non-consensual Order, by divorce decree or by will, intestacy or other
similar Law, so long as, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v), the assignee or transferee agrees to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement and executes and delivers to the parties hereto a
written consent memorializing such agreement.

 



A-1 (c) _New Shares_. Holder agrees that any shares of Company Common Stock that
Holder purchases or with respect to which Holder otherwise acquires record or
beneficial ownership (but excluding shares of Company Common Stock underlying
unexercised Company Common Stock Options (until such time as any such Company
Common Stock Options are exercised and the underlying shares of Company
Common Stock are acquired by Holder)) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
Expiration Date (" _New Shares_ ") shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they comprised the
Shares.

2.  _Agreement to Vote Shares_.

(a) Until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time, the Expiration Date and
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change that is not rescinded or otherwise
withdrawn, at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with
respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment thereof, and on
every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company with respect to any of the following, Holder shall appear at such
meeting (in person or by proxy) and shall vote (or cause to be voted) or
consent the Shares and any New Shares (i) in favor of adoption of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) against any Acquisition Proposal (the " _Covered Proposals_
"). This Agreement is intended to bind Holder as a stockholder of the Company
(and not in any other capacity such as a director or officer of the Company)
and only with respect to the Covered Proposals. Except as expressly set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2_, Holder shall not be restricted
from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any other
matter presented to the stockholders of the Company. Until the earlier to
occur of the Effective Time and the Expiration Date, Holder covenants and
agrees not to enter into any agreement or understanding with any Person with
respect to voting of its Shares on any Covered Proposal which conflicts with
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Holder further agrees that, until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time and the Expiration Date, Holder will not, and will not permit any entity
under Holders control to, (A) solicit proxies or become a "participant" in
a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Rule 14A under the Exchange
Act) in opposition to any Covered Proposal, (B) initiate a stockholders vote
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (C) become a member of a "group"
(as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to
any voting securities of the Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

3\. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Holder_. Holder hereby
represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that Holder (i) is the
beneficial owner of the Shares, which, at the date of this Agreement and at
all times up until the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the
Expiration Date, will be free and clear of any liens, claims, options,
charges or other encumbrances (other than those created by this Agreement) and
(ii) as of the date hereof does not own of record or beneficially any shares
of outstanding capital stock of the Company other than the Shares
(excluding shares as to which Holder currently disclaims beneficial ownership
in accordance with applicable law). Holder has the legal capacity, power and
authority to enter into and perform all of Holders obligations under
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Holder and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Holder,
enforceable against Holder in accordance with its terms, subject to (a) laws
of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors and (b) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief
and other equitable remedies.

 

4\. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Parent_. Parent hereby
represents, warrants and covenants to Holder that Parent has the legal
capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform all of Parents
obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject
to (a) laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the
relief of debtors and (b) rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

 



A-2 5\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate automatically and shall have
no further force and effect as of the earliest to occur of (i) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms and
provisions thereof, (ii) the notification by Parent to the Company that it is
not willing or not able to proceed with the Merger on substantially the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement, including by advising the Company that it
is unwilling to proceed with the Merger unless the Merger Consideration is
reduced or changed in form, (iii) any waiver, change or amendment to the
terms or conditions of the Merger Agreement that adversely affects Holder in
any material respect (including any reduction in the Merger Consideration, but
excluding any extension of the Termination Date pursuant to the Merger
Agreement), (iv) immediately following the Stockholders Meeting, including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, at which the Company Common Stockholders
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (v) the Termination Date
(the earliest of such dates, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Upon expiration of
this Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement.

 

6. _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) Holder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in Holders capacity as a beneficial owner of the Shares and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or affect Holder, or any Affiliate or designee of Holder, who serves as an officer or as a member of the Board in acting in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company and exercising his or her fiduciary duties and responsibilities in such capacity. 

 

7\. _Termination of Investor Rights Agreement_. To the extent a party thereto,
the Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Fourth Amended and
Restated Investor Rights Agreement of the Company, dated as of December 11,
2007, will be terminated, without any further rights, privileges, liabilities
or obligations of any kind or nature whatsoever applicable to any of
the parties thereto, effective and conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time.

8\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any term of this Agreement may be
amended or waived with the written consent of the parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns. Any amendment or waiver effected in
accordance with this _Section 8(a)_ shall be binding upon the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

(b) _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of the parties hereto (i)
consents to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (iii) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating
to this Agreement in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in
the State of Delaware.

(c)  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one instrument.

 

(d) _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement
are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or
interpreting this Agreement.

 



A-3 (e) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to Parent in accordance with
_Section 8.2_ of the Merger Agreement and to each Holder at its address set
forth on the signature page attached hereto (or at such other address for a
party as shall be specified by like notice).

(f) _Severability_. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to
be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to renegotiate such
provision in good faith, in order to maintain the economic position enjoyed by
each party as close as possible to that under the provision rendered
unenforceable. In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable
and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision shall
be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be
interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the
Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

 

(g) _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent or any of its Affiliates any direct or indirect
ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares or New
Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefit of and relating to the
Shares and any New Shares shall remain vested in and belong to Holder,
and Parent shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict,
regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the
Company or exercise any power or authority with respect to Holder in the
voting of any Shares or New Shares, except as specifically provided herein
and in the Merger Agreement.

(h) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific relief hereunder,
including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions to prevent and
enjoin breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in any state or federal court in
any competent jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which they may
be entitled at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond with respect to any such remedy are hereby waived.

 

(i) _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Board of
Directors of the Company has approved, for purposes of any applicable anti-
takeover laws and regulations, and any applicable provision of the Companys
organizational documents, the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (b) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto,
and (c) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.
