Section 2.02 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by

Price. Subject to the penultimate sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, the Final
Purchase Price and any consideration otherwise paid or deliverable to Seller
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
paid in full by Buyer to Seller free and clear of any deductions or
withholding incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

 

Section 2.03 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place no later than 10:00 a.m. Japan time on: (i) the
last day of the month in which the CP Satisfaction Date occurs if such day is
a Business Day; or (ii) the first Business Day immediately following the last
day of the month in which the CP Satisfaction Date occurs if the last day of
the month in which the CP Satisfaction Date occurs is not a Business Day
(subject, in the case of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this clause "(a)," to the
continuing satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 10_
on such Business Day); _provided_ that, if, following the CP Satisfaction
Date, less than eight (8) Business Days remain within the then current month,
the Closing shall not take place as described above but rather shall take
place on: (i) the last day of the month immediately following the month in
which the CP Satisfaction Date occurs if such day is a Business Day; or (ii)
the first Business Day immediately following the last day of the month
referred to in the preceding clause "(i)" if such last day is not a Business
Day (subject, in the case of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this clause "(b)," to
the continuing satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
10_ on such Business Day), or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller
may agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the day immediately preceding the
Business Day on which the Closing is scheduled to occur is not also a
Business Day, the Closing shall take place on the very next Business Day on
which there is a Business Day immediately preceding it (subject to the
continuing satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 10_
on such Business Day). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to as the "Closing Date." For the avoidance of doubt: (A) if the
Effective Time is prior to the Closing, then between the Effective Time and
the Closing, _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ shall continue to apply and, in addition,
the Company shall ensure that the Group Companies do not take any actions to
artificially impact the Net Working Capital, Net Debt or Seller Transaction
Expenses; and (B) if the Effective Time is after the Closing, then between the
Closing and the Effective Time, Buyer shall ensure that the Group Companies
are operated in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and do not take any actions to artificially impact the Net Working Capital,
Net Debt or Seller Transaction Expenses (it being understood that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary 

 



14

    

 contained in this Agreement, Seller agrees to be liable for damages caused
by a breach of clause "(A)" of this sentence and Buyer agrees to be liable for
damages caused by a breach of clause "(B)" of this sentence, in each case as
long as such breach is notified in writing by the non-breaching party to the
breaching party within one hundred (100) days after the Closing (but in no
event after the delivery to Seller of the Initial Closing Statement) where
Buyer is claiming a breach or within sixty (60) days after the delivery of the

or any other Group Company to discharge in full all indebtedness of the
Company and any other Group Company outstanding under the Credit Facilities
as of the Closing and to repurchase the Hitachi Preferred Shares as of the
Closing (collectively, the "Company Repayment Amount"). If the actual amount
in JPY required for the Company or any other Group Company to discharge in
full all such obligations is different than the Company Repayment Amount, such
difference shall be accounted for in the determination of Net Debt.

 

(c) At the Closing:

 

(i) Buyer shall pay to the Company the Company Repayment Amount in US$ (as
set forth in the notice provided to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.03(b)_) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account
designated in writing by or on behalf of the Company at least seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing in exchange for, at Buyers discretion,
newly issued Common Shares (such issuance, if any, made at the discretion of
Buyer with respect to all or a portion of the Company Repayment Amount, the
"Company Repayment Capital Contribution"), loan or note payable by the
Company, in each case issued at fair market value; _provided, however_ , that
if Seller determines that there will not be sufficient distributable profits
to consummate the Preferred Repurchase on the Closing Date under Applicable
Law, Buyer shall in any event receive newly issued Common Shares issued at
fair market value with respect to that portion of the Company Repayment Amount
required for the Company to repurchase the Hitachi Preferred Shares on the
Closing Date, in which case any registration and license tax imposed in
connection with such newly issued Common Shares shall be borne by Seller (the
"Excluded Registration Tax");

 

(ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Initial Purchase
Price (as defined in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(b)_) in US$ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account designated in writing by or on
behalf of Seller at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing;

 

(iii) upon confirmation that the holders of the Facility Liens over the
Shares have agreed to release such Facility Liens, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer the share certificates representing the Shares and a written request
addressed to the Company for the entry of change of shareholders name (
_meigi kakikae_ ) regarding the Shares affixed with the signature of Seller;
and

(a) Not more than eight (8) Business Days (but at least five (5) Business
Days) prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Pre-Closing Statement"),
which shall (subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) be binding on the parties,
setting forth Sellers good faith itemized estimates (including itemized
estimates of any components) of (i) Net Debt as of the Effective Time (the
"Estimated Closing Net Debt"), (ii) Net Working Capital as of the Effective
Time (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital") and (iii) the aggregate
amount of Seller Transaction Expenses as of the Effective Time (the "Estimated
Seller Transaction Expenses"), in each case, (x) with all such adjustments
that are based on any currency other than US$ converted into US$ using the
Specified Exchange Rate and (y) determined (if applicable) on a pro forma
basis as if the parties had not consummated the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_).

 

(b) The "Initial Purchase Price" shall be an amount equal to the Base
Purchase Price adjusted as follows, with all such adjustments that are based
on any currency other than US$ to be converted into US$ using the Specified
Exchange Rate (but for the avoidance of doubt, the Specified Exchange Rate
shall not apply to the Company Repayment Amount, which instead shall be based
on the notice provided to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_):

 

(i) (x) if the Estimated Closing Net Debt is a positive number, then the
Estimated Closing Net Debt shall be _deducted_ from the Base Purchase Price
and (y) if the Estimated Closing Net Debt is a negative number, then the
absolute value of the Estimated Closing Net Debt shall be _added_ to the Base
Purchase Price;

 

(ii) (x) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the
Net Working Capital Ceiling, then an amount equal to the excess of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital over the Net Working Capital Ceiling
shall be _added_ to the Base Purchase Price, and (y) if the Estimated Closing

(iv) the Company Repayment Amount to be paid by Buyer to the Company shall

An illustrative calculation of the Initial Purchase Price is attached hereto
as _Schedule 2.04(b)_. Any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.04(b)_ shall be referred to herein as the "Closing
Purchase Price Adjustment." Buyer shall not make any withholding or similar
deduction from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, unless there is
a change in Applicable Law prior to the Closing Date that requires such
withholding. In the event of such a change in Applicable Law, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement all amounts
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom or in connection therewith
under any provision of such Applicable Law. To the extent amounts permitted to
be withheld under the preceding sentence are so withheld and timely paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.05 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within one hundred (100) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"Initial Closing Statement") which shall include an itemized calculation
(including of any components) of the following items: (x) the actual amount of
Net Debt (the "Actual Closing Net Debt"), (y) the actual amount of the Net
Working Capital (the "Actual Closing Net Working Capital"), and (z) the actual
aggregate amount of Seller Transaction Expenses (the "Actual Seller
Transaction Expenses"), in each case, (x) as of the Effective Time, (y) with
all such adjustments that are based on any currency other than US$ converted
into US$ using the Specified Exchange Rate and (z) determined on a pro forma
basis as if the parties had not consummated the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_). Buyer
shall cause the Group Companies to make available to Seller and
its representatives and advisors the books, records, auditors working papers
and employees of the Group Companies and all other items requested by such
Person, in each case, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with
Sellers review of the Initial Closing Statement and the determination of the
Final Closing Statement (as defined below).

 

(b) Seller and its accountants shall have sixty (60) days after the
delivery of the Initial Closing Statement to review the Initial Closing
Statement. If Seller determines that any of the Actual Closing Net Debt,
Actual Closing Net Working Capital or Actual Seller Transaction Expenses has
not been determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Seller
shall inform Buyer in writing (an "Objection"), setting forth a description of
the basis of the Objection and the proposed adjustments to the amounts
(including itemized calculations thereof) of the Actual Closing Net
Debt, Actual Closing Net Working Capital or Actual Seller Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, which Objection must be delivered to Buyer on or
before the last day of such sixty (60) day period. Buyer shall then have
ten (10)

 



17

    

 Business Days to review and respond in writing to the Objection. Buyer and
Seller shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with respect to any
matters in dispute. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of their
disagreements with respect to the determination of the foregoing items within
ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of Buyers written response to
the Objection, they shall refer their remaining differences to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or an Affiliate of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), or
such other independent public accounting firm as mutually agreed to by Buyer
and Seller (the "Auditor"), which shall, acting as expert and not as
arbitrator, determine in accordance with this Agreement, and only with respect
to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what extent (if any)
the Actual Closing Net Debt, the Actual Closing Net Working Capital or the
Actual Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, requires adjustment. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Auditor may not determine that the Actual Closing
Net Debt is a lesser amount of Net Debt than the Estimated Closing Net Debt or
a greater amount of Net Debt than the Actual Closing Net Debt proposed by
Buyer in the Initial Closing Statement, or that the Actual Closing Net Working
Capital is a greater amount of Net Working Capital than the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital or a lesser amount of Net Working Capital than the Actual
Closing Net Working Capital proposed by Buyer in the Initial Closing
Statement, or that the Actual Seller Transaction Expenses are a lesser amount
of Seller Transaction Expenses than the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses
or a greater amount of Seller Transaction Expenses than the Actual Seller
Transaction Expenses proposed by Buyer in the Initial Closing Statement. Buyer
and Seller shall direct the Auditor to use its best efforts to render
its written determination as soon as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after such submission. The Auditors determination of the
Actual Closing Net Debt, the Actual Closing Net Working Capital and/or the
Actual Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by Buyer and Seller (i.e., not on independent
review) and on the definitions set forth in this Agreement. The Auditors
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller and shall
not be subject to appeal or further review (other than with respect to errors
in arithmetic calculations). The parties shall make readily available to the
Auditor all relevant books, records, employees, properties and any work
papers (including those of the parties respective accountants) relating to
the Initial Closing Statement, the parties review thereof, and all other
items and information reasonably requested by the Auditor. The "Final Closing
Statement" shall be deemed to be (i) if no Objection is delivered by Seller
during the sixty (60) day period specified above or if Seller notifies Buyer
of its agreement with the Initial Closing Statement prior to the expiration
of the sixty (60) day period specified above, the Initial Closing Statement,
or (ii) if any Objection is delivered by Seller during the sixty (60) day
period specified above, the Initial Closing Statement as adjusted by either
(A) the written agreement of the parties or (B) the written determination of
the Auditor. Any costs and expenses incurred by Seller, the Company or Buyer
in connection with the Initial Closing Statement, the Final Closing
Statement, any Objection and otherwise in connection with determining the
Actual Closing Net Debt, the Actual Closing Net Working Capital and/or the
Actual Seller Transaction Expenses shall be borne by the parties incurring
such costs and expenses; _provided_ that the fees and disbursements of the
Auditor shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 

(c) If the Final Purchase Price (i) is less than the Initial Purchase
Price, then within three (3) Business Days of the completion of the Final
Closing Statement, Seller shall make a payment to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated

 



18

    

 in writing by Buyer, in an amount equal to (A) the Initial Purchase Price
_minus_ (B) the Final Purchase Price, or (ii) is greater than the Initial
Purchase Price, then within three (3) Business Days of the completion of the
Final Closing Statement, Buyer shall make a payment to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated in
writing by Seller, in an amount equal to (A) the Final Purchase Price _minus_
(B) the Initial Purchase Price. The aggregate amount of payment to be made by
Buyer or Seller (as applicable) pursuant this _Section_ __ _ 2.05(c)_ shall
be referred to herein as the "Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment."

(d) Any calculation of Net Debt, Net Working Capital or Seller Transaction
Expenses to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ or this _Section_ __ _
2.05_ shall be calculated (i) with respect to Net Debt and Seller Transaction
Expenses, in accordance with IFRS and (ii) with respect to Net Working
Capital, in accordance with the accounting policies, practices, estimation
techniques, classifications and methodologies utilized in the illustrative
calculation of Net Working Capital provided in  _Schedule 2.05(d)_ and
consistently applied in accordance with IFRS. In any event, for the avoidance
of doubt, any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price shall be made without
duplication, including the elimination of any adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price which may occur as a result of any item taken into account in the
calculation of Net Debt to the extent such amount was taken into account in
the determination of Net Working Capital, the Company Repayment Amount or
Seller Transaction Expenses. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, after the final determination of Net Debt, Net Working Capital
and Seller Transaction Expenses and the payment of any Post-Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment, no party shall have the right to make any claim against any
other party related to any element of Net Debt, Net Working Capital or Seller
Transaction Expenses that such party raised, or could have raised, in the
process of completing the Final Closing Statement pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.05_.

Company or another applicable Group Company.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of any of the Group Companies
or the Business prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Group
Companies shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over their business

and the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Company will upon
reasonable request and notice, give Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access during regular
business hours to the properties, books, records and employees of the
Business in order that Buyer may have the opportunity to make such reasonable
investigations as it shall desire to make of the affairs of the Business,
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any
Subsidiary to) afford such access to the extent that the Company believes in
good faith that doing so would: (i) result in any unreasonable disruption to
the Business; (ii) violate any obligations of Seller or any Group Company
with respect to confidentiality to any third party or otherwise breach,
contravene or violate any then effective agreement to which Seller or any
Group Company is party; (iii) would cause a material risk of a loss of
privilege or trade secret protection to the Group Companies; or (iv) breach,
contravene or violate any Applicable Law (including any antitrust law). Buyer
and its representatives shall cooperate with Seller, the Group Companies and
their respective representatives and shall use

 



36

    

 their reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the Business in
connection with any such investigation and examination. Without limiting the
foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, subject to Applicable
Law, the Company will, and will cause the other Group Companies to, (1)
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to identify the key employees of the Group
Companies and (2) as promptly as reasonably practicable after Buyers request
provide Buyer with compensation-related information (including salary, wages,
bonuses and other perquisites) for any employees or category of employees of
any Group Company with respect to any period of time that begins on or after
the date that is two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) All information obtained by Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.02(a)_ shall be used solely for purposes reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and subject to the Non-Disclosure
Agreement. Any investigation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ shall be at
Buyers cost and expense and shall be conducted in such manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business. During any visit
to the business or property sites of any Group Company, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all
Applicable Law and all of the Group Companies safety and security
procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from
the date of this Agreement to the Closing, (i) none of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or representatives shall, without the prior written consent of the
Company, which may be withheld in the Companys sole and absolute discretion,
conduct any environmental investigation at any property owned or leased by any
Group Company involving any sampling or other intrusive investigation of air,
surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or in connection with any
such property, and (ii) Buyer shall not have access to personnel records of
any Group Company relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information the disclosure of which would violate
any Applicable Law or would reasonably be expected to subject any Group
Company or any of their Affiliates to risk of liability or the loss
of attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege.

Section 6.03 _Resignations_. At or prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
deliver to Buyer the resignations of all directors and statutory auditors of
the Group Companies that are employees or designated nominees of Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Company) as of the Closing Date (the
"Seller Directors" or "Seller Statutory Auditors," as the case may be).

 

Section 6.04 _Disposal of_ _Hitachi Kokusai_. Each of Seller and the
Company will take all steps as are within its control and reasonably
necessary to ensure that (a) the Companys current fiscal year will end after
the consummation of the Hitachi Kokusai Share Transfer but prior to the
Closing (the "Fiscal Year Change"), (b) the common shares of Hitachi Kokusai
owned by the Company will be transferred to HVJ Holdings or another Person
designated by Seller (the "Hitachi Kokusai Acquiror", and such transfer of
such common shares, the "Hitachi Kokusai Share Transfer") prior to the
Closing and the purchase price to be paid to the Company by the Hitachi
Kokusai Acquiror in the Hitachi Kokusai Share Transfer will be used to repay a
portion of the then outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities upon
the closing of the Hitachi Kokusai Share Transfer, and (c) the Hitachi Kokusai
Exit will occur at or prior to the Closing, including by the Company
exercising the call provision ( _shutoku joukou_ ) or requesting Hitachi to
exercise

 



37

    

 the put option ( _shutoku seikyuken_ ), pursuant to which the Company will
repurchase all of the Hitachi Preferred Shares from Hitachi for consideration
equal to the Preferred Share Acquisition Price ( _yusen kabushiki shutoku
kagaku_ ) as defined in and calculated in accordance with the articles of
incorporation of the Company (the "Preferred Repurchase"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Seller and the Company may take any action
necessary or desirable to consummate or proceed with the Fiscal Year Change
and the Hitachi Kokusai Exit so long as such actions do not (x) relinquish any
material right of any Group Company or (y) expose any Group Company to any
liability (whether accrued or unaccrued and whether contingent or otherwise)
which is not taken into account in the determination of the Initial Purchase
Price or Final Purchase Price, as applicable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.04_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

Section 6.05 _Facility Lien Release Letters_. The Company shall deliver
to Buyer prior to the Closing Date appropriate letters addressed to Seller or
the Company in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the
"Facility Lien Release Letters") together with any underlying documentation
or evidence connected therewith as reasonably requested by Buyer from the
holders of the Facility Liens in which such holders shall agree that the
Facility Liens will be released in full at the Closing, subject to repayment
in full of all outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.
Reasonable documentation evidencing the release of the Facility Liens at the
Closing shall be delivered to Buyer at the Closing; _provided _ that, in the
case filings or registrations with Governmental Authorities in the relevant
jurisdiction are required to be made to effect the release of the Facility
Liens and it is impracticable to make such filings or registrations at
the Closing, such documentation shall be delivered to Buyer as promptly as
possible once such filings or registrations are made.

 

Section 6.06 _Company Option Repurchase_. Each of Seller and the Company
will take all steps as are within its control and reasonably necessary to
ensure that all the Company Options (and any shares issued with respect
thereto) will be repurchased and cancelled by the Company effective prior to
or upon the Closing (the "Company Option Repurchase"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Seller and the Company may take any action
necessary or desirable to consummate or proceed with the Company Option
Repurchase so long as such actions do not (x) relinquish any material right
of any Group Company or (y) expose any Group Company to any liability (whether
accrued or unaccrued and whether contingent or otherwise) after the Closing
that would not be considered a Seller Transaction Expense. From time to time
and as reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller shall update Buyer on the status
of all actions that are necessary to be taken prior to the Closing to complete
the Company Option Repurchase prior to or upon the Closing, together with
copies of any notices, agreements or other documents delivered to or by the
Company in connection therewith.

 

Section 6.07 _Return of Information_. Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall request each Person that has executed a
confidentiality or similar agreement since January 1, 2018 in connection with
such Persons consideration of a possible acquisition of the Company to return
or destroy all confidential information previously furnished to such Person
by or on behalf of any of the Group Companies in accordance with the
destruction and retention provisions of such confidentiality or similar
agreement.

property registration of the land and building at the Companys Toyama plant

applicable Affiliates (and its and its applicable Affiliates
representatives) to, (i) promptly (and in any event within seventy two (72)
hours thereof) notify Buyer of any material developments relating to the
Arbitration, and (ii) promptly (and in any event within seventy two (72)
hours of the receipt, transmission or occurrence thereof) provide Buyer with:
(A) copies of all orders and other material documents filed with or by (or
provided to or by) any Governmental Authority or served between any Group
Company and ASM or other material documents relating to the Arbitration; and
(B) an extant summary of all material discussions with ASM or any
representative of ASM or any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Arbitration; _provided, however_ , that if the taking any of the actions
described in clause "(ii)" will result in a material breach of the ASM License
(to the extent any provisions thereof remain in effect) or a violation of
Applicable Law, the Company shall not be required to take such action, but
shall be required to use its reasonable efforts to find alternative ways
(consistent with any such provision or Applicable Law) to achieve the actions
contemplated by clause "(ii)".

any termination hereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.01_.
