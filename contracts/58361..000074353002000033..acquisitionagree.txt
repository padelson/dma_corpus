                                PURCHASE AND SALE

                  2.1. The Stock Purchase and HPI Redemption.

         (a) The Stock  Purchase.  Upon the terms and subject to the  conditions
set forth herein, at the Closing the HPI Stockholders shall transfer, assign and
deliver  to the  Purchaser,  and the  Purchaser  shall  purchase  from  each HPI
Stockholder, certain shares of HPI Common Stock as determined in accordance with
Section 2.1(c) (the "Purchased HPI Stock") owned by such HPI  Stockholders  (the
"Stock Purchase").

         (b) The HPI  Redemption.  Upon the terms and subject to the  conditions
set forth herein,  contemporaneously  with (and as part of the same overall plan
that includes) the closing of the Stock Purchase,  HPI shall redeem from the HPI
Stockholders the issued and outstanding  shares of capital stock of HPI owned by
them but not acquired by the  Purchaser in the Stock  Purchase as  determined in
accordance with Section 2.1(c) (the "Redeemed HPI Stock"),  in consideration for
the  delivery  by HPI of all of the then issued and  outstanding  shares of HEC,
which such HPI Stockholders agree to accept in exchange for the capital stock of
HPI so redeemed (the "HPI Redemption").

         (c) (i) Schedule I hereto sets forth, as of the date hereof,  the name,
address and social security or employer  identification number of each record or
beneficial  owner of HPI Common Stock,  as specified in Section  4.2(d).  At the

III to be  attached  hereto  showing,  with  respect to each class of HPI Common
Stock held by each HPI Stockholder listed on Schedule I, the portion of such HPI
Stockholder's  HPI Common Stock which  constitutes  Purchased  HPI Stock and the
portion of such HPI Stockholder's  HPI Common Stock which  constitutes  Redeemed
HPI Stock, determined in accordance with Section 2.1(c)(ii) below.

              (ii) The  portion  of a class of a HPI  Stockholder's  HPI  Common
         Stock  designated  as Purchased  HPI Stock shall equal a fraction,  the
         numerator  of  which  is the sum of the Cash  Payment  plus the  Escrow
         Amount  deposited with the Escrow Agent at Closing  pursuant to Section
         2.3,  and the  denominator  of which is such amount plus the HEC Agreed
         Value. The portion of a class of a HPI  Stockholder's  HPI Common Stock
         designated  as Redeemed HPI Stock shall equal the portion of such class
         which is not Purchased HPI Stock.

              (iii) Such Schedule III shall also set forth the capitalization of
         HEC as of the time immediately  prior to the HPI Redemption as well as,
         for each HPI Stockholder: (i) the number of shares of HEC capital stock
         (by class,  if relevant) to be delivered to such HPI Stockholder in the
         HPI Redemption, and (ii) the Redeemed HPI Stock (by class, if relevant)
         to be delivered by such HPI Stockholder to HPI in exchange for such HEC
         capital stock.

         2.2. Consideration for HPI Common Stock.

         Stockholders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; plus,

              (ii) in the event Cash  Equivalents  exceeds the Cash Amount,  the
         amount of such excess; minus,

              (iii) in the event the Cash Amount exceeds Cash  Equivalents,  the
         amount of such excess; minus,

              (iv) in the event  $7,544,405  exceeds the amount disbursed on the
         Capital  Program  between  October 31, 2001 and the Closing  Date,  the
         amount of such excess (the "Excess Capital Expenditure Amount"); plus,

         pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii); minus,

              (i) As promptly as  practicable,  but in any event  within  ninety
         (90) calendar days following the Closing,  the Purchaser shall cause to
         be  prepared  and   delivered  to  the  HPI   Stockholders   a  further
         determination   and  statement  (the   "Statement  of  Closing  Working
         Capital")  setting  forth  the  Closing  Working  Capital  of HPI.  The
         Statement  of  Closing   Working   Capital  shall  include  line  items
         substantially  consistent with those in the consolidated  balance sheet
         included in the Audited Financial Statements.

              (ii) Within thirty (30) calendar  days  following  delivery of the
         Statement  of Closing  Working  Capital  pursuant to Section  2.2(b)(i)
         hereof or, if applicable, such later date determined in accordance with
         Section  2.2(b)(iii),  (1)  the  HPI  Stockholders  shall  pay  to  the
         Purchaser the amount,  if any, by which the Closing  Working Capital of
         HPI shown on the Statement of Closing  Working  Capital of the Acquired
         Companies is less than the  Benchmark  Date Working  Capital of HPI, or
         (2) the Purchaser shall pay to the HPI Stockholders the amount, if any,
         by which the Closing  Working  Capital of HPI shown on the Statement of
         Closing Working Capital is more than the Benchmark Date Working Capital
         of HPI. Any and all payments made  pursuant to this Section  2.2(b)(ii)
         shall bear  interest at the three (3) month London  Inter-Bank  Offered
         Rate  published  in the Wall Street  Journal on the  Closing  Date (the
         "Interest  Rate") for the period  commencing on the Closing Date and to
         but not  including  the  date of  payment,  and  shall  be made by wire
         transfer of  immediately  available  funds to an account  designated in
         writing by the party to receive such payment.

              (iii) If the HPI  Stockholders  Representative  disagrees  in good
         faith with the  Statement  of  Closing  Working  Capital,  then the HPI
         Stockholders  Representative shall notify the Purchaser in writing (the
         "Stock Purchase Notice of Disagreement")  of such  disagreement  within
         thirty  (30)  calendar  days  following  delivery of the  Statement  of
         Closing  Working  Capital.  The Stock Purchase  Notice of  Disagreement
         shall set forth in  reasonable  detail  the basis for the  disagreement
         described therein.  Thereafter, the HPI Stockholders Representative and
         the  Purchaser  shall  attempt  in good faith to  resolve  and  finally
         determine  the amount of the  Closing  Working  Capital  of HPI,  which
         amount  shall  not be less  than the  amount  thereof  shown in the HPI
         Stockholders  Representative's  calculations  contained  in  the  Stock
         Purchase Notice of Disagreement  nor more than the amount thereof shown
         in the Purchaser's  calculations  contained in the Statement of Closing
         Working  Capital.  If  the  HPI  Stockholders  Representative  and  the
         Purchaser  are unable to resolve the  disagreement  within  thirty (30)
         calendar  days  following  delivery  of the  Stock  Purchase  Notice of
         Disagreement,   then  the  HPI  Stockholders   Representative  and  the
         Purchaser  shall  retain  the  services  of  Ernst  &  Young  LLP  (the
         "Independent  Accountant")  to  resolve  the  disagreement  and  make a
         determination  with respect thereto.  Such  determination will be made,
         and  written  notice  thereof  given  to the HPI  Stockholders  and the
         Purchaser,  within thirty (30) calendar days after such selection.  The
         determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
         conclusive upon the HPI  Stockholders  and the Purchaser.  The scope of
         the Independent  Accountant's  engagement  (which will not be an audit)
         shall be limited to the resolution of the disputed  items  described in
         the Stock Purchase Notice of Disagreement,  and the  recalculation,  if
         any, of the  Statement  of Closing  Working  Capital of HPI in light of
         such  resolution.  If an Independent  Accountant is engaged pursuant to
         this  Section  2.2(b)(iii),  the fees and  expenses of the  Independent
         Accountant  shall  be  borne  (i) by the  Purchaser  if the  difference
         between  the  Closing  Working  Capital  of  HPI  and  the  Purchaser's
         calculation  of  Closing  Working  Capital  of  HPI  contained  in  the
         Statement of Closing  Working  Capital is greater  than the  difference
         between the  Closing  Working  Capital of HPI and the HPI  Stockholders
         Representative's   calculation  of  Closing   Working  Capital  of  HPI
         contained in the Stock Purchase Notice of Disagreement, (ii) by the HPI
         Stockholders  if the first such difference is less than the second such
         difference,  and (iii)  otherwise  equally by the Purchaser and the HPI
         Stockholders.  Within ten (10) calendar days after delivery of a notice
         of determination by the Independent  Accountant as described above, any
         payment required by Section  2.7(b)(ii) hereof shall be paid based upon
         such determination, together with interest at the Interest Rate for the
         period commencing on the Closing Date and to but not including the date
         of payment.

              (iv) Any payment to be made to or by the HPI Stockholders pursuant
         to this Section  2.2(b) shall be allocated  among the HPI  Stockholders
         pro rata based on their  ownership  as of the  Closing of shares of HPI
         Common Stock.

         2.3. Escrow. At the Closing, in addition to delivering or causing to be

Agreement"),  which may be used  solely to  satisfy  amounts  payable by the HPI
Indemnifying  Stockholders  to the Purchaser  pursuant to Article 8 hereof.  The
parties hereto  acknowledge and agree that if the HPI Indemnifying  Stockholders

or may (in the case of Section  8.1(b) or (c)),  prior to  seeking  satisfaction
directly from any HPI Indemnifying Stockholder, seek to satisfy such payment out
of the Escrow Amount until no further amount is available from the Escrow Amount
to satisfy such  obligation  pursuant to the terms of the Escrow  Agreement,  it
being  understood  that,  to the extent any other  provision  of this  Agreement
provides  that the Escrow  Amount is the  exclusive  source of  payment  for any
obligation,  neither  this  sentence nor any other  provision of this  Agreement
shall give rise to any further recourse against the HPI Stockholders for payment
thereof.

         2.4. Cash Amount and Capital  Expenditure  Adjustment.  Within five (5)
calendar days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the HPI Stockholders
Representative  shall mutually agree upon the Cash Amount,  the Cash Equivalents
and the  Excess  Capital  Expenditure  Amount.  Within  ten (10)  calendar  days

the amount,  if any, by which the Cash  Equivalents  is less than the sum of (a)
the Cash  Amount  and (b) the  Excess  Capital  Expenditure  Amount,  or (2) the
Purchaser  shall pay to the HPI  Stockholders  the amount,  if any, by which the

Capital  Expenditure  Amount. Any and all payments made pursuant to this Section

Stockholders  pursuant  to this  Section  2.4 shall be  allocated  among the HPI
Stockholders  pro rata based on their  ownership  as of the Closing of shares of
HPI Common Stock.

such  company's  incorporation,  and  has  all  requisite  corporate  power  and
authority to own, operate or lease the assets and properties now owned, operated
or leased by it, and to conduct its  operation  as  presently  conducted by such
company.  Each Acquired Company is duly authorized,  qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign  corporation,  and is in good standing,  under the Laws of
each  state or other  jurisdiction  in which  the  character  of such  company's
properties  owned,   operated  or  leased,  or  the  nature  of  such  company's
activities,  makes  such  qualification  necessary,  except in those  states and
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably  be  expected,  as of the date  hereof,  to have a  Material  Adverse
Effect.  Corporate  minutes of each Acquired Company for the five years ended on
the date hereof and the stock records of each Acquired Company (other than Sioux
City) have been delivered to the Purchaser.  Complete and accurate  records with
respect to the issuance,  transfer,  redemption  and  cancellation  of shares of

capacity to enter into this  Agreement and the HPI  Stockholders  Documents,  to
perform their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate
the transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been duly,
and at the Closing the HPI Stockholder Documents will be, executed and delivered
by, or on behalf of, the HPI Stockholders and,  assuming the due  authorization,
execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement  by the  Purchaser,  this  Agreement
constitutes, and at the Closing the HPI Stockholder Documents will constitute, a
legally  valid  and  binding  obligation  of the HPI  Stockholders,  enforceable
against the HPI  Stockholders in accordance  with their  respective  terms,  and
subject to (i) the effect of any applicable Laws of general application relating
to bankruptcy, reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and relief of debtors generally,  and (ii) the effect of rules
of Law and  general  principles  of equity,  including  rules of Law and general
principles of equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

         (b) HPI and HEC have all  requisite  corporate  power and  authority to
enter into this Agreement, to perform such company's obligations hereunder,  and
to consummate the transactions  contemplated  hereby. The execution and delivery
by HPI  and HEC of  this  Agreement,  the  performance  by HPI and HEC of  their
obligations  hereunder,  and the consummation by HPI and HEC of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of HPI and HEC. This  Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by HPI and HEC and,  assuming the due  authorization,  execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Purchaser,  this Agreement constitutes a legally valid and
binding obligation of HPI and HEC, enforceable against HPI and HEC in accordance
with its terms,  and subject to (i) the effect of any applicable Laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy,  reorganization,  insolvency,  moratorium or
similar Laws affecting  creditors' rights and relief of debtors  generally,  and
(ii) the effect of rules of Law and  general  principles  of  equity,  including
rules of Law and general  principles of equity governing  specific  performance,
injunctive  relief and other  equitable  remedies  (regardless  of whether  such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

authorizations  set forth in  Schedule  4.4 hereto  have been  obtained  and all
registrations,  qualifications,  designations,  declarations or filings with any
Governmental  Authorities  set forth in Schedule 4.4 hereto have been made,  and
except as set forth in Schedule 4.2 hereto,  the  execution and delivery by HPI,
HEC  and the  HPI  Stockholders  of  this  Agreement  and  the  HPI  Stockholder
Documents,  the  performance  by HPI,  HEC and the  HPI  Stockholders  of  their
respective  obligations  hereunder or thereunder,  and the  consummation by each
party of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not conflict with or violate
in any material respect,  constitute a material default (or event which with the
giving of notice or lapse of time,  or both,  would  become a material  default)
under,  give  rise  to  any  right  of  termination,   amendment,  modification,
acceleration or cancellation of any material  obligation or loss of any material
benefit under, result in the creation of any material  Encumbrance on any assets
or properties  of such  company,  or require such company to obtain any consent,
waiver or approval of, make any filing with, or give any notice to any Person as

Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Except as set forth in Schedule  4.2, each HPI  Stockholder  is the
record and beneficial  owner of the HPI Common Stock indicated as being owned by
such on  Schedule  I hereto,  free and clear of any and all  Liens  (other  than
limitations  on  voting  rights  on the  Class A shares  of HPI  Common  Stock).
Schedule I hereto  sets  forth,  as of the date  hereof,  the name,  address and
social security or employer  identification  number of each record or beneficial
owner of HPI Common Stock.  Each HPI  Stockholder has the power and authority to
sell,  transfer,  assign and deliver such shares of HPI Common Stock as provided
in this  Agreement,  and such  delivery  will convey to the  Purchaser  good and
marketable title to such shares, free and clear of any and all Liens (other than
limitations on voting rights on the Class A shares of HPI Common Stock).

         4.3.  Capitalization,  Subsidiaries and Charter. The authorized capital
stock of HPI consists of four hundred  seventy-five  thousand  shares  (475,000)
shares  of  Class A common  stock  with a par  value of  $10.00  per  share  and
twenty-five thousand (25,000) shares of Class B common stock with a par value of

seventy-five  thousand  (375,000)  Class A shares of HPI Common Stock issued and
outstanding and twenty-five thousand (25,000) Class B shares of HPI Common Stock

fifty  (4,750)  Class  B  shares  of HPI  Common  Stock  are  held by HPI in its
treasury.  All of the issued  and  outstanding  shares of HPI  Common  Stock are
validly  issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable.  There are no securities of HPI
outstanding  which are  convertible  into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
shares of HPI Common Stock, there are not now, nor at the Closing will there be,
any outstanding or authorized subscriptions,  options,  warrants, calls, rights,
commitments  or any other  agreements of any character  obligating HPI to issue,
sell or transfer any  additional  shares of HPI Common  Stock or any  securities
convertible  into or  evidencing  the right to  subscribe  for any shares of HPI
Common Stock except as set forth in Schedule 4.3.

         (a) Schedule 4.3 hereto sets forth the name,  date and  jurisdiction of
incorporation,  and the  outstanding  shares of capital  stock of each  Acquired
Company  other than HPI,  and each  Subsidiary  thereof  (other than HEC and its

jurisdiction of  incorporation  and has the corporate power and lawful authority

its business as now being and as heretofore conducted. Each Subsidiary listed on
Schedule  4.3 hereto is duly  qualified  or  otherwise  authorized  as a foreign
corporation to transact business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in
which the  nature of the  activities  conducted  by it or the  character  of the
assets owned or leased by it makes such  licensing or  qualification  necessary,
except  where the  failure to be so  licensed  or  qualified  would not,  in any
individual case, reasonably be expected as of the date hereof to have a Material
Adverse  Effect.  All of the issued and  outstanding  shares of such company are
validly  issued,  fully  paid and  nonassessable.  All  shares of each  Acquired
Company  other than HPI,  and each  Subsidiary  thereof  (other than HEC and its
Subsidiaries) are owned beneficially and of record by the corporation  specified
as the owner in  Schedule  4.3 hereto,  free and clear of all Liens,  except for

subscriptions,  options,  warrants,  calls,  rights,  commitments  or any  other

to subscribe for any shares of such company.

Subsidiaries, does not own any direct or indirect equity or debt interest in any
other Person,  including  any interest in a  corporation,  partnership  or joint
venture, and is not obligated or committed to acquire any such interest,  in any
case in which the Subsidiary,  interest or other Person relates primarily to HPI
or the Acquired Companies.

         (c) HPI and each company  listed on Schedule 4.3 hereto has  heretofore
delivered to the Purchaser true and complete  copies of its  respective  charter

or the HPI Stockholder Documents,  the performance by the HPI Stockholders,  HPI
and  HEC  of  their  respective  obligations  hereunder  or  thereunder,  or the

insurance  company),  any affiliate or agent thereof,  nor any  co-insurers,  or

Agreement.

the material rights of any other Person and, to its Knowledge, there are no such
claims  pending or threatened  alleging such  infringement.  To the Knowledge of
each  Acquired  Company,  no other  Person  is  materially  infringing  upon the

with all material provisions of any license or other agreement pursuant to which
it has the right to use any licensed Software and any software subject to shrink
wrap or click-wrap agreements.  To the Knowledge of each Acquired Company, it is
not  infringing  on any  Intellectual  Property  rights of any other Person with
respect to its use of the  Software.  The  Software  operates  without  material
operating defects.

to the knowledge of each  Acquired  Company on the part of any other party under

         (b) Except as set forth in  Schedule  4.9,  each  Acquired  Company has

Acquired Company or with respect to which each Acquired Company has any material
Liability, including "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3)

former  Employees  other than to the extent  necessary  to comply with Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA or Section  4980B of the Code or similar  state Law  ("COBRA").
True and complete  copies of the Benefit  Plans have been made  available to the
Purchaser.

         (b)  Each  Benefit  Plan  has  been  maintained  and   administered  in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the

reporting and disclosure obligations). Each Benefit Plan (other than any Benefit
Plan that is a  Multiemployer  Plan)  which is intended  to be  qualified  under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter that it
is so  qualified;  to the extent  that there  have been any  amendments  to such
Benefit  Plan  after  the  most  recent  favorable   determination   letter,  an
application for a determination  letter has been filed with the Internal Revenue

<PAGE>

         (c) No Acquired  Company has any material  Liability  under Title IV of
ERISA  (other than for the payment of  premiums,  none of which are  overdue) in
respect of any Benefit Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan. Except as disclosed
in  Schedule  4.10(c),  no  Acquired  Company  has  Knowledge  of any  facts  or
circumstances  that  reasonably  could be expected to give rise to any  material
Liability of any Acquired  Company under Title IV of ERISA.  Except as disclosed
in Schedule  4.10(c),  no Acquired  Company or any ERISA  Affiliate  thereof has
incurred  or  expects  to  incur  material   Liability  in  connection  with  an
"accumulated  funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code,
whether or not waived.  No Acquired Company has incurred any material  Liability
or  penalty  under  Section  4975 of the Code or  Section  502(i) of ERISA  with
respect  to any  Benefit  Plan.  Each  Benefit  Plan  has  been  maintained  and
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms.  There is no
pending,  nor has any Acquired Company received notice of, any threatened Action
against or otherwise  involving  any of the Benefit  Plans other than claims for
benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business.  All  contributions  required to be
made by Law,  Contract or other document as of the date of this Agreement to the
Benefit  Plans have been made or provided for as of the date of this  Agreement.
No payment  that is owed by or may become due pursuant to any Benefit Plan as in
effect on or before the  Closing  Date will be  non-deductible  to the  Acquired
Companies  under  Section  280G of the  Code  as a  result  of the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement  nor will any  Acquired  Company be required to
compensate  any Person  because of the  imposition of the Tax imposed by Section
4999 of the Code on such a payment.

         (d) No  Multiemployer  Plan  subject  to  Title IV of ERISA to which an
Acquired  Company is  required to  contribute  is in  reorganization  status (as
defined in Section 4241 of ERISA) or is insolvent (as defined in Section 4245 of
ERISA). No Acquired Company has withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA with  respect  to which  there is any  outstanding  withdrawal
liability  (within the meaning of Section  4201 of ERISA) as of the date of this
Agreement.  Except as  disclosed  in  Schedule  4.10(d)  in the  event  that any
Acquired  Company  were to make a  complete  withdrawal  as of the  date of this
Agreement from any Benefit Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, to the Knowledge of the Acquired  Companies no Acquired  Company would
have any material  withdrawal  liability  (within the meaning of Section 4201 of
ERISA).  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent any representation contained in Section 4.10(a), 4.10(b), 4.10(c) or this
Section  4.10(d)  applies or relates to a Benefit  Plan that is a  Multiemployer
Plan, such representation is limited to the Knowledge of the Acquired Companies.

         (e) Each  Acquired  Company has complied in all material  respects with
the requirements of COBRA.

         (f) Except as set forth on Schedule  4.10(f)  hereto,  no individual is

hereto,  together  with such  fixed  assets of the  Acquired  Companies  with an
original cost of less than $10,000 or which have been fully depreciated,  as the
case may be (including the licenses or leasehold interests in or relating to the
Leased  Assets),  constitute all of the material  assets,  properties and rights
necessary for the conduct of the  operations of each Acquired  Company,  in each
case in the manner consistent with past practice.

         (b)  Each of the  Acquired  Companies  owns all of its  owned  tangible
personal property free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Encumbrances.

Companies  listed on the  depreciation  schedules  set forth in Schedule  4.5(a)
hereto or the Leased Assets are in such condition and repair  (ordinary wear and
tear excepted)  suitable for operation of the business of the Acquired Companies
for property of comparable  type,  age and usage,  except for tangible  personal
property  that is  obsolete,  depleted  or worn  out and no  longer  used in the
operations of each Acquired Company.

creation  of  any  material  Encumbrance  on any  assets  or  properties  of the
Purchaser,  or require the  Purchaser to obtain any consent,  waiver or approval
of, make any filing with, or give any notice to any Person as a result or under,
the terms or provisions of (i) the  organizational  documents of the  Purchaser,
(ii) any Contract to which the  Purchaser  is a party or is bound,  or (iii) any
Law  applicable  to  the  Purchaser,  or  any  Governmental  Order  issued  by a
Governmental  Authority by which the Purchaser is in any way bound or obligated,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 5.3, as would not,
in any  individual  case,  have a material  adverse effect on the ability of the
Purchaser to perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement  and the  Purchaser
Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         5.4.  Governmental  Consents.  No material consent,  waiver,  approval,
order  or  authorization  of,  or  registration,   qualification,   designation,
declaration or filing with, any  Governmental  Authority is required on the part
of the Purchaser in connection  with the execution and delivery by the Purchaser
of this Agreement and the Purchaser Documents,  the performance by the Purchaser
of its  obligations  hereunder  and  thereunder,  and  the  consummation  by the
Purchaser of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby,  except as set
forth in Schedule 5.4 hereto.

         5.5.  Brokers.  All  negotiations  relative to this  Agreement  and the
transactions contemplated hereby have been carried out by the Purchaser directly
with the HPI  Stockholders  without the  intervention of any Person on behalf of
the Purchaser in such manner as to give rise to any claim by any Person  against
the HPI Stockholders, HPI, HEC, or any other Acquired Company for a finder's fee
or brokerage commission .

         5.6.  Funding.  The Purchaser  will have  borrowing  facilities  which,
together with its available  cash, will be sufficient to enable it to consummate
the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement and pay all related fees and
expenses for which the Purchaser will be responsible at the Closing.

         5.7. Investment Representation;  Business Investigation.  The Purchaser
is  acquiring  the HPI Common Stock for its own account or  investment  purposes
only and not with a view to the distribution of the shares of such common stock.
The Purchaser acknowledges that none of the HPI Common Stock has been registered
under  the  Securities  Act or any  state  securities  Law in  reliance  upon an
exemption therefrom for non-public  offerings,  that shares of common stock must
be held indefinitely  unless the sale thereof is registered under the Securities
Act  or  such  state  securities  law,  or  an  exemption   therefrom  for  such
registration is available under Rule 144,  promulgated under the Securities Act,
or  otherwise.  The  Purchaser  (a)  has  such  knowledge,   sophistication  and
experience  in business and  financial  matters that it is capable of valuing an
investment  in the  shares  of the  HPI  Common  Stock,  (b)  has  conducted  an
examination of the reports and other materials relating to each Acquired Company
prepared by HPI,  (c) fully  understands  the nature,  scope and duration of the
limitations on transfer applicable to the shares of the HPI Common Stock and (d)
can bear the  economic  risk of an  investment  in the  shares of the HPI Common
Stock and can afford a complete loss of such investment.

         6.2.   Access   and   Information.   Subject   to  the   terms  of  the
Confidentiality  Agreement,  at all times during the period  commencing upon the
execution and delivery hereof by each of the parties hereto and terminating upon
the  earlier  to occur  of the  Closing  or the  termination  of this  Agreement
pursuant to and in  accordance  with the terms of Section 9.1 hereof,  HPI shall
permit,  and the HPI  Stockholders  and HPI shall cause each Acquired Company to
permit,  the Purchaser and its  authorized  agents and  representatives  to have
reasonable  access,  upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to
all of the Employees,  assets and properties and all relevant books, records and
documents of or relating  primarily to each  Acquired  Company and the assets of
any Acquired  Company,  and shall furnish to the Purchaser such  information and
data,  financial  records and other documents  relating thereto as the Purchaser
may reasonably  request,  subject,  in each case, to the terms of any applicable
confidentiality  agreement. Each Acquired Company shall permit the Purchaser and
its agents and representatives  reasonable access to such company's accountants,
auditors and  suppliers  for  reasonable  consultation  or  verification  of any
information  obtained by the  Purchaser  during the course of any  investigation
conducted  pursuant to this  Section 6.2,  and shall use  reasonable  efforts to
cause  such  Persons  to  cooperate  with  the  Purchaser  and  its  agents  and
representatives in such consultations and in verifying such information.  If the
Purchaser  desires to perform any invasive  testing at the Owned Real  Property,
the Purchaser (or its agents) shall do so only after notifying HPI and obtaining
HPI's prior  written  consent  thereto,  which  consent may not be  unreasonably
withheld  or  delayed,  but which  may be  subject  to any terms and  conditions
reasonably  imposed by HPI,  including the prompt  restoration of the Owned Real
Property  to its  condition  prior  to any such  inspections  or  tests,  at the
Purchaser's  sole cost and expense.  Neither the  Purchaser nor its agents shall
perform any testing on any  property of a landlord on any Leased Real  Property,
nor shall they take any action which may cause a default  under the terms of any
lease. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be conducted in such
manner as not to interfere  unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Acquired Companies.

         6.3.  Confidentiality.  The terms of the Confidentiality  Agreement are
hereby  incorporated  herein by reference  and shall  continue in full force and
effect from and after the Closing in  accordance  with the terms  thereof,  such
that the information  obtained by any party hereto, or its officers,  employees,
agents or  representatives,  during  any  investigation  conducted  pursuant  to
Section  6.2  hereof,   in  connection  with  the  negotiation,   execution  and
performance  of  this  Agreement  or  the   consummation  of  the   transactions
contemplated   hereby,  shall  be  governed  by  the  terms  set  forth  in  the
Confidentiality Agreement.

         6.4. Further Actions.

         (a) Upon the  terms and  subject  to the  conditions  set forth in this
Agreement  (including the terms of Section 6.4(b) hereof), the HPI Stockholders,
each  Acquired  Company  and the  Purchaser  shall  each  use  their  respective
commercially  reasonable  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action,  and to do, or cause to be done,  and to assist and  cooperate  with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things  necessary,  proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including:

              (i)  obtaining  all  necessary  Material   Licenses,   actions  or
         nonactions,     waivers,    consents,    approvals,     authorizations,
         qualifications  and other orders of any  Governmental  Authorities with
         competent jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated hereby;

              (ii) obtaining all necessary  consents,  approvals or waivers from
         third parties;

              (iii)  defending  any lawsuits or other Actions  challenging  this
         Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby,
         including  seeking to have  vacated or reversed  any stay or  temporary
         restraining order entered by any Governmental  Authority prohibiting or
         otherwise restraining the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby; and

              (iv)  executing  and   delivering   any  additional   instruments,
         certificates  and other documents  necessary or advisable to consummate
         the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  and to  fully  carry  out  the
         purposes of this Agreement.

         (b)  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,   the  HPI
Stockholders,  each Acquired  Company and the Purchaser  hereby agree to proceed
diligently to prepare and to file, no later than ten (10) days after the date of
this Agreement:
<PAGE>

              (i) any  notification,  transfer  application  and report form and
         related material  required under the HSR Act and to provide promptly to
         Governmental  Authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement
         of  any  applicable   antitrust  Laws  all  information  and  documents
         requested by any such Governmental Authorities or necessary,  proper or
         advisable  to  permit  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
         hereby; and

              (ii) any  notification,  transfer  application and report form and
         related material  required under applicable Law and to provide promptly
         to  Governmental   Authorities   with  regulatory   jurisdiction   over
         enforcement  of any  applicable  Laws  all  information  and  documents
         requested by any such Governmental Authorities or necessary,  proper or
         advisable  to  permit  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
         hereby.

The  Purchaser,  the HPI  Stockholders,  HEC and each  Acquired  Company  hereby
further agree to use their  respective  commercially  reasonable best efforts to
(1) respond to any request of any Governmental  Authority for  information,  (2)
contest and resist any Action,  including  any  legislative,  administrative  or
judicial  Action,  and  have  vacated,  lifted,  reversed  or  overturned,   any
Governmental Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby,
including by using all legal efforts to vigorously  pursue all available avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal and all available  legislative action, and
(3) in  the  event  that  any  permanent  or  preliminary  injunction  or  other
Governmental Order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in
any proceeding  that would make  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement  unlawful or that would
prohibit,   prevent,  delay  or  otherwise  restrain  the  consummation  of  the
transactions contemplated hereby, to cause the relevant Governmental Authorities
to  vacate,  modify or  suspend  such  injunction  or order so as to permit  the
consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby prior to the Termination
Date.

         6.5.  Fulfillment  of Conditions by the HPI  Stockholders,  HEC and the
Acquired  Companies.  The HPI Stockholders,  HEC and each Acquired Company shall
not knowingly  take or cause to be taken,  or fail to take or cause to be taken,
any action that would cause the conditions to the  obligations of such person or
the Purchaser to consummate the transactions  contemplated  hereby to fail to be
satisfied  or  fulfilled  at or prior to the  Closing,  including  by  taking or
causing to be taken,  or failing to take or cause to be taken,  any action  that
would cause the representations and warranties made by each company in Article 4
hereof  to  fail  to be true  and  correct  as of the  Closing  in all  material
respects.  The HPI  Stockholders,  HEC and each Acquired  Company shall take, or
cause  to be  taken,  all  actions  within  their  or its  power  to cause to be
satisfied or fulfilled,  at or prior to the Closing, the conditions precedent to
the Purchaser's  obligations to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby
as set forth in Section 7.1 hereof.

         6.6.  Fulfillment of Conditions by the Purchaser.  The Purchaser  shall
not knowingly  take or cause to be taken,  or fail to take or cause to be taken,
any  action  that  would  cause the  conditions  to the  obligations  of the HPI
Stockholders,  HEC and each Acquired  Company or the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to fail to be satisfied or fulfilled, including
by taking or causing to be taken,  or failing to take or cause to be taken,  any
action that would cause the representations and warranties made by the Purchaser
in  Article 5 hereof to fail to be true and  correct  as of the  Closing  in all
material  respects.  The Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions
within  its  power to cause to be  satisfied  or  fulfilled,  at or prior to the
Closing,  the  conditions  precedent  to the  obligations  of  such  company  to
consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby as set forth in Section  7.2
hereof.

         6.7. Publicity. The HPI Stockholders,  HEC and any Acquired Company and
the  Purchaser   shall   cooperate  with  each  other  in  the  development  and
distribution of all news releases and other public  disclosures  relating to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  Neither of the HPI  Stockholders,
HEC or each Acquired  Company nor the Purchaser shall issue or make, or allow to
have issued or made,  any press release or public  announcement  concerning  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  without the consent of the other
party  hereto,  except as  otherwise  required by  applicable  Law or, as to the
Purchaser, the New York Stock Exchange rules, but in any event only after giving
the other party  hereto a reasonable  opportunity  to comment on such release or
announcement in advance, consistent with such applicable legal requirements.
<PAGE>

         6.8.  Transaction  Costs. The Purchaser shall pay all transaction costs
and expenses  (including  legal,  accounting and other  professional  (including
environmental  consultants and title companies) fees and expenses and other fees
described  in  Section  5.5  hereof)  that it  incurs  in  connection  with  the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated hereby. The HPI Stockholders shall pay (except to
the extent paid by any Acquired  Company  prior to the Closing) all  transaction
costs and expenses (including legal,  accounting and other professional fees and
expenses  and other fees  described  in Section 4.23 hereof) that they or any of
HEC or any Acquired Company incur in connection with the negotiation,  execution
and  performance  of this  Agreement and the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby.  Responsibility  for such payment shall be allocated among
the HPI  Stockholders  pro rata based on their  ownership  as of the  Closing of
shares of HPI Common  Stock.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing and anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement,  HPI and the Purchaser shall share equally
any filing fees in connection  with the HSR Act,  which filing fees will be paid
prior to the Closing.

         6.9. Employees and Employee Benefit Matters.

         (a) Except as  provided  in Section  6.9(b),  immediately  prior to the
Closing Date, HPI shall cease, and shall cause each of the Acquired Companies to
cease, to be a participating  employer under,  and terminate its sponsorship of,
each  Benefit  Plan  other  than such  plans  sponsored  by,  contributed  to or
otherwise  covering  employees (or their dependents or  beneficiaries)  of Sioux
City (the "Sioux City Benefit Plans"). Except as provided in Section 6.9(b), HEC
shall pay,  discharge,  or assume and be solely responsible for, the sponsorship
of all Benefit Plans and all Liabilities which arise or become payable under any
Benefit Plan before,  upon or with respect to Benefit Plans other than the Sioux
City Benefit Plans, after Closing, except to the extent any such Liabilities are
included in the Statement of Closing Working  Capital.  The Purchaser  shall, or
shall cause the Acquired  Companies to pay,  discharge and be solely responsible
for  all  Liabilities  which  arise  or  become  payable  as a  result  of or in
connection with the employment by the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies of any
Employees  for  periods  after  Closing,  including,   without  limitation,  all
severance or termination pay and all accrued vacation,  salary,  wages and other
compensation payments or benefits under or pursuant to any employee benefit plan
of the  Purchaser,  the Sioux City Benefit  Plans or under any employee  benefit
plans established by the Acquired  Companies after the Closing Date, as the case
may be. The  Purchaser  shall not assume or be  obligated  to pay or perform any
Liabilities  under any  Benefit  Plans other than the Sioux City  Benefit  Plans
(including any stay bonus or severance  policy,  plan,  arrangement or benefit),
except that the Purchaser shall provide  vacation pay to Employees to the extent
such  vacation pay is accrued and included in the  Statement of Closing  Working
Capital.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the other provisions of this Section
6.9 other than  subsections  (h), (i), (j), and (l) shall not apply with respect
to a Benefit  Plan to the extent the  Acquired  Company is  required to sponsor,
maintain, or participate in such plan under the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement  covering  employees of the Acquired Company and each Acquired Company
shall continue to sponsor, maintain, or be a participating employer under such a
Benefit Plan to the extent necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  To the extent
any Benefit  Plan is both  attributable  to a  collective  bargaining  agreement
covering  employees  of an  Acquired  Company  and  not  attributable  to such a
collective bargaining agreement,  HEC shall spin-off the portion of such Benefit
Plan attributable to a collective  bargaining agreement covering employees of an
Acquired Company as directed by the Purchaser before,  on, or after the Closing,
and the Purchaser  shall cause such Acquired  Company to assume  sponsorship and
all  liabilities in respect  thereof.  The provisions of Section 6.9 (other than
the first  sentence of this  Section  6.9(b))  shall apply to the portion of any
Benefit Plan that an Acquired Company is not required to sponsor,  maintain,  or
participate in under the terms of any collective bargaining agreement.

         (c) For a period  commencing  on the  Closing  Date and  ending  on the
earlier of (i) the first  anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the Employee's
termination  of  employment  with an  Acquired  Company  or the  Purchaser,  the
Purchaser  shall  provide  or cause the  Acquired  Companies  to provide to each
Employee   medical   benefits   subject   to  COBRA  and   disability   benefits
(collectively,  "Purchaser's  Benefit Programs").  With respect to any Employees
covered by any of the Purchaser's Benefit Programs,  service through the Closing
Date with the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates shall be taken into account
for all purposes under the Purchaser's  Benefit  Programs as if such service had
been with the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

         (d) The  Purchaser  shall cause the  Acquired  Companies to provide and
recognize all accrued but unused vacation as of the Closing Date.

         (e) HEC and the HPI  Stockholders  shall be responsible  for payment of
all covered medical,  dental, life insurance and long-term  disability claims or
expenses  incurred by any Employee  prior to the Closing Date, and the Purchaser
shall not  assume  nor shall any  Acquired  Company  or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries  (other than HEC) be responsible  for any liability with respect to
such claims. For this purpose, a long-term  disability claim shall be treated as
incurred  prior to the Closing  Date if such  long-term  disability  immediately
follows a short-term  disability  that arose on or before the Closing Date.  Any
preexisting  condition  clause in any of the welfare plans  (including  medical,
dental and disability  coverage)  included in the Purchaser's  Benefit  Programs
shall be waived for any Employees  who are covered by such plans.  The Purchaser
shall cause the Purchaser's  Benefit  Programs to credit such Employees with any
amounts  shown on  records  provided  by HEC for this  purpose as paid under the
Benefit  Plans  prior to the  Closing  Date toward  satisfaction  of  applicable
deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding  Purchaser Benefit
Programs. and HEC shall provide accurate records for this purpose. The Purchaser
shall provide to HEC documents necessary to enroll Employees in such Purchaser's
Benefit Programs,  and HEC shall cooperate in distributing such documents to the
Employees with the intent that such enrollments be effective  immediately  after
the Closing.

         (f) The Purchaser shall cause the Acquired  Companies to be responsible
for providing any Employee (and such employees' "qualified beneficiaries" within
the  meaning  of Section  4980B(f)  of the Code) who has a  "qualifying  event,"
within the meaning of Section  4980B(f) of the Code, after the Closing Date with
the  continuation  of group  health  coverage  required  by COBRA to the  extent
required by law.

         (g) With respect to the Employees, after the Closing, the Purchaser and
the Acquired  Companies shall have the liability and obligation for, and neither
HEC, the HPI Stockholders nor any of their respective  Affiliates shall have any
liability or obligation  for: (1)  short-term  disability and sick pay or salary
continuation  benefit claims  incurred  after the Closing;  and (2) any medical,
dental,  life  insurance,  long-term  disability or other welfare benefit claims
incurred after the Closing,  but only under the terms of the Purchaser's Benefit
Programs or the Sioux City  Benefit  Plans and only to the extent the  Employees
are covered  under such programs or plans.  For this purpose,  claims other than
medical or dental claims shall be treated as incurred  after the Closing only if
such claims are attributable to an event, e.g.,  disability,  which arises after
the Closing.

         (h) The Purchaser and the Acquired  Companies  shall be responsible for
all  liabilities or  obligations  under the Worker  Adjustment  and  Restraining
Notification  Act and similar  state and local rules,  statutes  and  ordinances
resulting from the actions of the Purchaser or the Acquired  Companies after the
Closing.

         (i) HEC  shall be  liable  for any  workers'  compensation  or  similar
workers'  protection  claims of any Employee incurred on or prior to the Closing
Date to the extent not  covered by  insurance  of the  Acquired  Companies.  The
Purchaser  and  the  Acquired   Companies  shall  be  liable  for  any  workers'
compensation  or similar  workers'  protection  claims of any Employee  incurred
after the Closing Date.  For this  purpose,  claims shall be treated as incurred
after the Closing  Date only if such claims are  attributable  to an event which
occurred after the Closing Date.

         (j) Subject to applicable law, HEC shall provide to the Purchaser, upon
its request,  demographic information regarding each Employee, including rate of
pay, age, date of birth, date of employment and accrued vacation.

         (k)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  in  this  Agreement,   the
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any Acquired Company shall
have any  interest in, or right to, any asset  associated  with any Benefit Plan
after the Closing.

         (l) The covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 6.9 shall be
solely for the benefit of, and shall only be enforceable by, the parties to this
Agreement and their permitted  assigns.  Without  limiting the generality of the
foregoing,  nothing in this  Agreement  shall provide or be construed to provide
any Employees with any rights under this  Agreement,  and no Person,  other than
the  parties to this  Agreement,  is or shall be entitled to bring any action to
enforce any provision of this Agreement.

         6.10.  Interdivisional  Agreements.  Unless otherwise  requested by the
Purchaser in writing,  prior to Closing,  each Acquired Company shall terminate,
without any continuing  Liability to the Acquired Company  resulting  therefrom,
all  agreements  between any  division,  Affiliate or Subsidiary of such company
other  than  HEC,  on the  one  hand,  and  HEC or any  division,  Affiliate  or
Subsidiary thereof, all of which are described in Schedule 6.10 hereto.
<PAGE>

         6.11.  Schedules.  The HPI Stockholders and each Acquired Company shall
have the right  from  time to time  after the date  hereof  to  deliver  written
updates of the Schedules  attached  hereto (the  "Schedules") to reflect matters
that  existed,  occurred or arose prior to the date hereof and were not included
on the Schedules  attached  hereto but should have been so included (the updated
Schedules  being  referred to as the "Updated  Schedules" and such matters being
referred to as the "Update  Matters").  The parties  shall use  reasonable  best
efforts  to  identify  any  items  on  the  Updated   Schedules   that  are  not
appropriately responsive to the applicable representations and warranties and to
eliminate any such items from the Updated  Schedules.  If the  Purchaser's  good
faith  estimate,  based on all  information  then  reasonably  available  to the
Purchaser,  of the aggregate  Loss for which  indemnification  would be required
pursuant  to Article 8 hereof  (without  taking  into  account  the  limitations
contained  in Section  8.5(b)) with  respect to the Update  Matters  (other than
those  eliminated  pursuant  to  the  efforts  referred  to in  the  immediately
preceding  sentence)  exceeds   $3,000,000,   then  the  Purchaser  or  the  HPI
Stockholders  Representative shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement under
Section 9.1(e). If the Closing occurs,  then,  subject to all of the limitations
and  conditions  contained  in Article 8  (including,  without  limitation,  the
threshold and  deductible  contained in Section  8.5(b)) the Purchaser  shall be
entitled to  indemnification in respect of Losses relating to the Update Matters
(other than any  eliminated or disregarded as aforesaid) to the same extent that
the Purchaser would have been entitled to such indemnification in the absence of
the delivery of the Updated Schedules, and, except as otherwise provided in this
sentence  with respect to  indemnification,  the Updated  Schedules  (absent any
portion  thereof  relating to an Update Matter  eliminated  as aforesaid)  shall
constitute the final Schedules for purposes of this Agreement.

         6.12.  Retention of and Access to Records.  From and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall preserve, in accordance with HPI's normal document retention
policy,  all books and  records  transferred  by each  Acquired  Company  to the
Purchaser  pursuant to this  Agreement.  As soon as  practicable  following  the
Closing,  the  Purchaser  shall deliver a copy of such books and records of each
Acquired  Company in the possession of the Purchaser  pursuant hereto to the HPI
Stockholders  which are reasonably  necessary to enable the HPI  Stockholders to
prepare  all Tax  Returns of HPI and each other  Acquired  Company  relating  to
periods  ending on or prior to the Closing Date.  In addition to the  foregoing,
from and after the Closing,  the Purchaser shall afford to the HPI Stockholders,
and their counsel,  accountants and other authorized agents and representatives,
during normal business hours, reasonable access to the employees, books, records
and other data relating to each  Acquired  Company with respect to periods prior
to the  Closing,  and the right to make copies and  extracts  therefrom,  to the
extent that such access may be reasonably  required by the requesting  party (a)
to facilitate the investigation,  litigation and final disposition of any claims
which may have been or may be made  against  any such  party or  Person,  or its
Affiliates,  (b) for the preparation of Tax Returns and audits,  and (c) for any
other reasonable business purpose.

         6.13. Tax Matters.

         (a) Liability for Taxes.

              (i) To the extent provided in Section 8.1, and pursuant to Article
         8 (and subject to the limitations  thereof),  the HPI Indemnitors agree
         to and  shall  indemnify  and hold the  Purchaser,  and its  directors,
         officers, employees,  Affiliates (including HPI and any of the Acquired
         Companies if the Closing occurs),  agents and assigns harmless from and
         against any and all Losses  resulting  from,  based upon or arising out
         of, directly or indirectly:  (A) Taxes imposed on any Acquired  Company
         (other than Sioux City) for any taxable  year or period that ends on or
         before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle  Period,  the
         portion of such  Straddle  Period  ending on and  including the Closing
         Date,  (B) Taxes  imposed on or related to HEC for any taxable  year or
         period and (C) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company as a result of the
         HPI  Redemption;  provided,  however,  that no HPI Indemnitor  shall be
         liable  for or  pay,  and no HPI  Indemnitor  shall  indemnify  or hold
         harmless any Person from and against,  (I) any Taxes taken into account
         as a liability or reserve (whether taken into account as a liability or
         reserve,  as an offset to an asset,  or otherwise) in  determining  the
         final Closing  Working  Capital of HPI, (II) any Taxes that result from
         any  actual or deemed  election  under  Section  338 of the Code or any
         similar  provisions  of state,  local or foreign law as a result of the
         purchase or redemption  of the HPI Common Stock or the deemed  purchase
         of shares of any  Acquired  Company or that result from the  Purchaser,
         any  Affiliate  of the  Purchaser,  or the  Purchaser  or any  Acquired
         Company  engaging in any activity or  transaction  that would cause the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be treated as a purchase
         or sale of assets of any Acquired Company for federal,  state, local or
         other Tax purposes,  (III) any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company or
         for which any Acquired  Company may  otherwise be liable as a result of
         transactions  occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable
         (based on, among other  relevant  factors,  factors set forth in Treas.
         Reg.ss.  1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B))  to the  portion of the  Closing  Date
         after the  Closing,  (it being  understood  and agreed that in no event
         shall the HPI Redemption be regarded as a transaction described in this
         clause (III)),  (IV) Taxes imposed as a result of or in connection with
         (i) any  dividends  paid by Sioux City to HPI on or after  December 31,
         2001,  (ii) the  conversion  of  Principal  Financial  Group or Liberty
         Mutual Insurance Company to stock form from mutual insurance companies,
         or (iii) the sale of HPI's  capital  stock in Sioux City pursuant to an
         exercise by Hagadone  of its rights  under the Buy and Sell  Agreement,
         dated as of March 1, 1992,  (V) any Taxes  resulting from a sale of any
         Acquired  Company by the  Purchaser or any  Affiliate of the  Purchaser
         (Taxes described in this proviso, hereinafter "Excluded Taxes"). Except
         to the  extent  taken  into  account  as an asset  (whether  taken into
         account  as an asset,  as an  offset  to a  liability  or  reserve,  or
         otherwise) in determining  the final Closing Working Capital of HPI, or
         except as provided in the last  sentence of  paragraph  (a)(ii) of this
         Section 6.13, the HPI  Stockholders  shall be entitled to any refund of
         (or credit for) Taxes for which any HPI Indemnitor is liable under this
         Agreement (including, without limitation, any refund of, or credit for,
         Taxes of HEC or any  Acquired  Company due to the  overpayment  of such
         Taxes prior to the Closing Date).

              (ii) To the  extent  provided  in Section  8.2,  and  pursuant  to
         Article 8 (and  subject  to the  limitations  thereof),  the  Purchaser
         agrees to indemnify and hold the HPI  Stockholders and their respective
         directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and assigns harmless
         (after  the  Closing)  from and  against  any and all Losses of the HPI
         Stockholders  resulting from, based upon or arising out of, directly or
         indirectly: (A) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company (other than Sioux
         City) for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date
         and, with respect to any Straddle Period,  the portion of such Straddle
         Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) Excluded Taxes.  Except
         as otherwise  provided  herein,  the Purchaser shall be entitled to any
         refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which the Purchaser is liable under
         this   Agreement.   With  the  express   written  consent  of  the  HPI
         Stockholders  Representative,  which consent shall be given or withheld
         in the HPI Stockholders Representative's sole discretion, the Purchaser
         may cause an  Acquired  Company  to elect to carry back  losses  from a
         taxable  year or period that begins after the Closing Date to a taxable
         year or  period  that  ends  on or  before  the  Closing  Date  and the
         Purchaser  shall be  entitled  to any actual  refund of (or credit for)
         Taxes that would not have arisen but for such carryback.
<PAGE>

              (iii) For purposes of paragraphs  (a)(i) and (a)(ii),  whenever it
         is  necessary  to  determine  the  liability  for Taxes of any Acquired
         Company for a Straddle  Period,  the  determination of the Taxes of the
         Acquired  Company for the portion of the Straddle  Period ending on and
         including,  and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
         Closing Date shall be determined  by assuming that the Straddle  Period
         consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close
         of the Closing  Date and the other which began at the  beginning of the
         day following the Closing Date, and items of income,  gain,  deduction,
         loss or credit of the Acquired Company shall be allocated  between such
         two  taxable  years or  periods on a  "closing  of the books  basis" by
         assuming  that the books of the  Acquired  Company  were  closed at the
         close of the Closing Date,  provided,  however,  that (I)  transactions
         occurring on the Closing Date that are  properly  allocable  (based on,
         among  other  relevant  factors,  factors  set forth in Treas.  Reg.ss.
         1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B))  to the portion of the  Closing  Date after the
         Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed
         to begin at the  beginning  of the day  following  the Closing Date (it
         being  understood  and agreed that in no event shall the HPI Redemption
         be regarded as a  transaction  described in this clause (I)),  and (II)
         exemptions,  allowances or deductions  that are calculated on an annual
         basis,  such as the deduction for  depreciation,  shall be  apportioned
         between   such  two  taxable   years  or  periods  on  a  daily  basis.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a)(iii), if
         the   transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  result  in  the
         reassessment of the value of any property owned by the Acquired Company
         for property Tax purposes, or the imposition of any property Taxes at a
         rate which is  different  than the rate that would have been imposed if
         such  transactions  had not  occurred,  then  (y) the  portion  of such
         property  Taxes for the portion of the  Straddle  Period  ending on and
         including the Closing Date shall be determined on a daily basis,  using
         the  assessed  value  and Tax rate that  would  have  applied  had such
         transactions  not occurred,  and (z) the portion of such property Taxes
         for the portion of such  Straddle  Period  beginning  after the Closing
         Date shall be the total  property  Taxes for the Straddle  Period minus
         the amount described in clause (y) of this sentence.

              (iv)  (A) If,  as a result  of any  action,  suit,  investigation,
         audit,  claim,  assessment or amended Tax Return of an Acquired Company
         for a taxable year or period on or prior to the Closing Date,  there is
         any change  after the Closing  Date in an item of income,  gain,  loss,
         deduction, credit or amount of Tax that results in an increase in a Tax
         liability  for  which  any HPI  Indemnitor  would  otherwise  be liable
         pursuant to  paragraph  (a)(i) of this  Section  6.13,  and such change
         results in or will  result in a decrease  in the Tax  liability  of the
         Purchaser,  HPI or any other  Acquired  Company  (or any  Affiliate  or
         successor  of any  thereof)  for any taxable  year or period  beginning
         after  the  Closing  Date or for the  portion  of any  Straddle  Period
         beginning  after the Closing  Date, no HPI  Indemnitor  shall be liable
         pursuant to such paragraph  (a)(i) with respect to such increase to the
         extent of such  decrease  (and,  to the  extent  such  increase  in Tax
         liability is paid to a taxing  authority by any HPI  Indemnitor  or any
         Affiliate thereof,  the Purchaser shall pay the relevant HPI Indemnitor
         an  amount  equal  to  the  present  value  of  such   decrease).   All
         calculations shall be made at the time of the relevant  indemnification
         payment using reasonable  assumptions (as agreed to by the indemnifying
         and  indemnified  party) and present value  concepts  (using a discount
         rate equal to the applicable  federal rate in effect at the time of the
         change in Tax  liability  (based on the  Federal  mid-term  rate) using
         semi-annual compounding plus four (4) percentage points).
<PAGE>

              (B) If, as a result of any  action,  suit,  investigation,  audit,
         claim,  assessment  or amended Tax Return of an Acquired  Company for a
         taxable  year or period  after the  Closing  Date,  there is any change
         after the Closing  Date in an item of income,  gain,  loss,  deduction,
         credit or amount of Tax that results in an increase in a Tax  liability
         for which the Purchaser would otherwise be liable pursuant to paragraph
         (a)(ii) of this Section 6.13, and such change results in or will result
         in a decrease in the Taxes of HEC or any HPI Stockholder payable to any
         Governmental  Authority  for any  taxable  year or period  ending on or
         before  the  Closing  Date or for the  portion of any  Straddle  Period
         ending on and including the Closing  Date,  the Purchaser  shall not be
         liable pursuant to such paragraph (a)(ii) with respect to such increase
         to the extent of such actual decrease (and, to the extent such increase
         in Tax liability is paid to a taxing  authority by the  Purchaser,  the
         HPI Indemnitors  shall pay the Purchaser an amount equal to the present
         value of such actual  decrease).  Nothing in this  paragraph  (B) shall
         require HEC or any HPI  Stockholder to file an amended Tax Return,  and
         nothing  in  this   paragraph  (B)  shall  be  construed  in  a  manner
         inconsistent  with Section 6.13(d).  All calculations  shall be made at
         the  time of the  relevant  indemnification  payment  using  reasonable
         assumptions (as agreed to by the  indemnifying  and indemnified  party)
         and  present  value  concepts  (using  a  discount  rate  equal  to the
         applicable  federal  rate in  effect  at the time of the  change in Tax
         liability  (based  on the  Federal  mid-term  rate)  using  semi-annual
         compounding plus four (4) percentage points).

              (v)   Notwithstanding   anything  herein  to  the  contrary,   the
         Purchaser, on the one hand, and the HPI Indemnitors, on the other hand,
         shall each pay  one-half  of any real  property  transfer or gains Tax,
         sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax
         imposed on the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (other than
         the HPI Redemption).  Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver
         to the HPI Stockholders  Representative its good faith determination of
         the fair market value (or other applicable tax base) of property giving
         rise to taxes described in the preceding sentence (except to the extent
         related to the HPI Redemption).

              (vi) For federal  income tax purposes,  the parties agree to treat
         the HPI Redemption as a taxable distribution by HPI governed by Section
         311 of the Code and a taxable exchange by the HPI Stockholders governed
         by  Section  302(a) of the Code,  and in each case by other  applicable
         provisions of the Code not inconsistent  with such treatment.  Prior to
         the  Closing,  the HPI  Stockholders  Representative  shall send to the
         Purchaser a notice  setting forth its good faith  determination  of the
         value  of  the  HEC  capital  stock  to  be   distributed  to  the  HPI
         Stockholders  in connection  with the HPI  Redemption  (the "HEC Agreed
         Value").  The Purchaser and each HPI Stockholder agrees not to take any
         position for federal,  state, local or other Tax purposes  inconsistent
         with such treatment and the HEC Agreed Value;  provided,  however, that
         the Purchaser  otherwise makes no  representation or warranty as to the
         correctness of such treatment or the HEC Agreed Value.
<PAGE>

         (b) Tax Returns.

              (i) The HPI Stockholders Representative shall prepare (or cause to
         be  prepared)  all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
         respect to the Acquired  Companies for taxable years or periods  ending
         on or before the Closing  Date (in the case of Tax Returns  relating to
         federal and state  Income  Taxes) or due on or before the Closing  Date
         (in the case of other Tax  Returns).  With respect to Tax Returns to be
         prepared by the HPI  Stockholders  pursuant to the  preceding  sentence
         that are  required  to be  filed  prior to the  Closing  Date,  the HPI
         Stockholders  Representative  shall  timely  file or cause to be timely
         filed (at past venues for filing such Tax Returns) such Tax Returns and
         timely  remit or cause to be timely  remitted the Taxes shown to be due
         on such Tax Returns.  With respect to Tax Returns to be prepared by the
         HPI  Stockholders  Representative  pursuant  to  the  second  preceding
         sentence  that are not required to be filed prior to the Closing  Date,
         portions of such Tax Returns  shall be  submitted  to the  Purchaser as
         early as practicable  prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns
         and, in all events,  complete  Tax Returns  shall be  submitted  to the
         Purchaser not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing
         such Tax Returns and the  Purchaser  shall sign (or caused to be signed
         by the appropriate  Person) and timely file or cause to be timely filed
         (at past  venues for filing  such Tax  Returns  except with the written
         consent,  not to be  unreasonably  withheld,  of the  HPI  Stockholders
         Representative)  such Tax Returns and timely  remit the amount of Taxes
         shown to be due on such Tax  Returns.  All Tax  Returns  required to be
         prepared  by the  HPI  Stockholders  Representative  pursuant  to  this
         Section 6.13(b) shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with
         past practice and no position  shall be taken,  election made or method
         adopted that is inconsistent  with positions  taken,  elections made or
         methods used in prior  periods in preparing and filing such Tax Returns
         (including,  without limitation,  positions which would have the effect
         of  deferring  income to periods for which the  Purchaser  is liable or
         accelerating  deductions  to periods  for which any HPI  Indemnitor  is
         liable). For purposes of determining when any Tax Return is required to
         be filed and  whether  any Tax Return is timely  filed,  there shall be
         taken into account applicable extensions properly obtained.

              (ii) The  Purchaser  shall  prepare (or cause to be prepared)  all
         other Tax Returns  that are  required to be filed by or with respect to
         the Acquired Companies, and the Purchaser shall timely file or cause to
         be timely filed such Tax Returns when due and the Purchaser shall remit
         or cause to be remitted  any Taxes due in respect of such Tax  Returns.
         With  respect to Tax Returns to be filed by the  Purchaser  pursuant to
         the preceding  sentence that relate to taxable years or periods  ending
         on or before the Closing  Date (x) such Tax  Returns  shall be prepared
         and filed in a manner  consistent with past practice  (including at the
         past venues for filing,  except  with the  written  consent,  not to be
         unreasonably  withheld, of the HPI Stockholders  Representative) and no
         position  shall be  taken,  election  made or  method  adopted  that is
         inconsistent  with positions  taken,  elections made or methods used in
         prior  periods in  preparing  and filing  such Tax  Returns  (including
         positions which would have the effect of accelerating income to periods
         for which any HPI  Indemnitor  is liable  or  deferring  deductions  to
         periods  for which the  Purchaser  is liable)  and (y) such Tax Returns
         shall be submitted  to the HPI  Stockholders  Representative  not later
         than five (5) days  prior to the due date for filing  such Tax  Returns
         (or,  if such due date is within  five (5) days  following  the Closing
         Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) for review
         and approval by the HPI Stockholders Representative, which approval may
         not be unreasonably  withheld, but may in all cases be withheld if such
         Tax Returns  were not  prepared in  accordance  with clause (x) of this
         sentence.  For purposes of determining  when any Tax Return is required
         to be filed and whether any Tax Return is timely filed,  there shall be
         taken into account applicable extensions properly obtained.

         (c)  Reimbursement.  The  HPI  Indemnitors,  on the one  hand,  and the
Purchaser,  on the other  hand,  shall  reimburse  the other party for Taxes for
which any HPI Indemnitor or the Purchaser,  respectively,  is liable pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.13 but which are shown to be due on and required
to be remitted  with  respect to any Tax Return to be filed by the  Purchaser or
the HPI Stockholders Representative,  respectively,  pursuant to Section 6.13(b)
in accordance with Section 8.3(h).
<PAGE>

         (d) Amended Tax Returns.  None of the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the
Purchaser shall (or shall cause or permit any Acquired Company to) amend, refile
or otherwise  modify (or grant an extension  of any statute of  limitation  with
respect to) any Tax Return  relating in whole or in part to HEC or any  Acquired
Company  with  respect  to any  taxable  year or period  ending on or before the
Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle  Period) without the prior written
consent of the HPI Stockholders Representative, which consent may be withheld in
the sole discretion of the HPI Stockholders Representative.

         (e) Tax  Package.  The  Purchaser  shall  promptly  cause the  Acquired
Companies to prepare and provide to HPI Stockholders Representative a package of
Tax information  materials,  including,  without limitation,  schedules and work
papers (the "Tax Package") required by HPI Stockholders Representative to enable
HPI Stockholders  Representative to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to
be prepared and filed by it pursuant to paragraph (b)(i).  The Tax Package shall
be completed in accordance  with past  practice,  including  past practice as to
providing  such  information  and as to the method of  computation  of  separate
taxable  income or other relevant  measure of income of the Acquired  Companies.
The  Purchaser  shall  cause  the  Tax  Package  to  be  delivered  to  the  HPI
Stockholders  Representative  not later than  fifteen  (15) days  following  the
Closing Date.

         (f) Contest  Provisions.  The Purchaser  shall promptly  notify the HPI
Stockholders Representative in writing upon receipt by the Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates,  or any of the  Acquired  Companies  of  notice  of any  pending  or
threatened  federal,  state,  local  or  foreign  Tax  audits,  examinations  or
assessments  which might affect the Tax liabilities for which any HPI Indemnitor
may be  liable  pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of  this  Section  6.13.  The  HPI
Stockholders  Representative  shall have the sole right to  represent  HEC's and
each Acquired  Company's  interests in any Tax audit or  administrative or court
proceeding  relating to taxable  periods ending on or before the Closing Date or
otherwise  relating to Taxes for which any HPI Indemnitor may be liable pursuant
to Section 6.13, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the case
of  a  Straddle   Period  of  any  Acquired   Company,   the  HPI   Stockholders
Representative  shall be entitled to participate at its expense in any Tax audit
or  administrative  or court proceeding  relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes
attributable  to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing  Date and,  with the written  consent of the  Purchaser,  and at the HPI
Stockholders  Representative's  sole expense,  may assume the entire  control of
such audit or proceeding.  None of the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates,  or any
Acquired  Company  may  settle  any Tax  claim  for any  Taxes for which any HPI
Indemnitor  may be liable  pursuant to Section  6.13,  without the prior written
consent of the HPI Stockholders Representative, which consent may be withheld in
the reasonable discretion of the HPI Stockholders Representative.

         (g) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of the HPI
Stockholders  Representative and the Purchaser shall (and cause their respective
Affiliates to):

              (i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such
         other party is responsible  for preparing and filing in accordance with
         paragraph (b) of this Section 6.13 or with respect to HEC;

              (ii)  cooperate  fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes
         with  taxing  authorities  regarding,  any  Tax  Returns  of HEC or any
         Acquired Company or HEC;

              (iii) make  available to the other and to any taxing  authority as
         reasonably  requested all information,  records, and documents relating
         to Taxes of any Acquired Company;

              (iv) provide  timely notice to the other in writing of any pending
         or threatened Tax audits or assessments of any Acquired  Company or HEC
         for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under this
         Section 6.13;

              (v) furnish the other with copies of all  correspondence  received
         from  any  taxing  authority  in  connection  with  any  Tax  audit  or
         information request with respect to any such taxable period;

              (vi) timely sign and deliver such  certificates or forms as may be
         necessary or  appropriate  to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
         reduce),  or file Tax Returns or other  reports  with respect to, Taxes
         described in paragraph  (a)(v) of this Section 6.13 (relating to sales,
         transfer and similar Taxes); and

              (vii)  timely  provide to the other  powers of attorney or similar
         authorizations  necessary  to carry out the  purposes  of this  Section
         6.13.
<PAGE>

         6.14.  Interim  Financial  Statements.  For the period commencing as of
November  1, 2001 and  ending on the  Closing  Date,  HPI shall  deliver  to the
Purchaser,  promptly  after  the  end of each  month  in  such  period,  updated
individual  unaudited  financial  statements  for each Acquired  Company for the
portion  of the  fiscal  year  ended  as of the  end of  such  month.  All  such
statements shall be prepared on a modified cash basis.

         6.15. Audited Financial Statements. The HPI Stockholders recognize that
the Purchaser is a publicly reporting company and agree that the Purchaser shall
be entitled at the Purchaser's expense to cause certain financial  statements to
be prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  as required
by  Law  applicable  to  the  Purchaser  as  a  publicly  reporting  company  or
registrant;  provided that prior to the Closing,  the  Purchaser  shall not file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission any financial statements relating to
the  Acquired  Companies  without  the written  consent of the HPI  Stockholders
Representative  (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed if
such filing is required by Law).  HPI agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser and
its auditing  accountants as reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection
with  the  preparation  and  filing  of  such  financial  statements,  including
providing a customary management representation letter in the form prescribed by
generally  accepted  auditing  standards  and  shall  assist  the  Purchaser  in
obtaining  the  consent  of HPI's  independent  accounting  firm to  permit  the
Purchaser and the Purchaser's auditors to have access to such firm's work papers
and to include its report on the Audited Financial Statements in any filing with
any  Governmental  Authority  by the  Purchaser.  Any and all costs and expenses
reasonably  incurred by HPI pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be reimbursed by
the Purchaser prior to the Closing.

         6.16.  No  Solicitation.  For the period from the date hereof until the
date of  termination  of this  Agreement in accordance  with Section 9.1 hereof,
neither the HPI  Stockholders  nor any Acquired  Company  will, or will cause to
permit any  Acquired  Company or HEC to,  directly or  indirectly,  (i) discuss,
negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as the
proposed surviving,  merged, acquiring or acquired corporation,  any transaction
involving a merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition
of all or any  significant  part of the assets (other than sales of inventory in
the ordinary  course) or capital stock or other equity  interest in any Acquired
Company or Sioux City other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or a sale of Sioux City  pursuant to the Buy and Sell  Agreement  dated March 1,
1992 (an  "Acquisition  Transaction"),  (ii) facilitate,  encourage,  solicit or
initiate  discussions,  negotiations  or  submissions  of proposals or offers in
respect of an Acquisition  Transaction,  (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished,
to any Person, any information concerning the business,  operations,  properties
or assets of any Acquired Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction,
or (iv)  otherwise  cooperate  in any way with,  or assist  or  participate  in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek
any of the foregoing.  The HPI Stockholders  will inform the Purchaser  promptly
following  the receipt by any of them,  any  Acquired  Company or HEC, or any of
their or any Acquired  Company's  representatives,  of any bona fide proposal or
inquiry in respect of any Acquisition Transaction.

         6.17. Investments.  HPI shall take such commercially reasonable actions
to  assure  that its  investment  securities  held at the  Closing  Date will be
readily  convertible to immediately  available funds without loss at the Closing
Date.

         6.18.  Certain  Assets.  The  Purchaser  agrees that on or prior to the
Closing,  HPI may  transfer  and  assign,  for no  consideration,  the  personal
property  set  forth on  Schedule  6.18 to  Safety  Syringes  Inc.  and the real
property set forth in Schedule 6.18 to HEC, and such property  shall be owned by
Safety Syringes Inc. and HEC, respectively, after the Closing.

         6.19. Discharge of HPI Excluded  Liabilities.  HEC covenants and agrees
that it will pay,  discharge  or  otherwise  satisfy each and every HPI Excluded
Liability  as  such  liabilities   become  due  and  payable  (except  for  such
liabilities as are being  contested in good faith);  provided that the foregoing
shall  not  limit  the  Purchaser's  right to make a claim  for  indemnification
pursuant  to Section  8.1(c)  hereof.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the HPI
Indemnifying  Stockholders acknowledge and agree that pursuant to Section 8.5(g)
they shall be severally  liable for the HPI Excluded  Liabilities  to the extent
indemnification is not available from HEC.
<PAGE>

         6.20.  Sioux City.  HPI agrees to  immediately  notify the Purchaser if
Hagadone Investment Co. ("Hagadone") gives any written notice of its exercise of
its buy or sell right under the Buy and Sell Agreement,  dated March 1, 1992. If
HPI  receives  such a written  notice  from  Hagadone,  HPI agrees to obtain the
Purchaser's  approval  (which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed)  prior to making an election to sell its shares in Sioux City or to buy
Hagadone's shares in Sioux City. If HPI elects to buy Hagadone's shares in Sioux
City and such  transaction  closes prior to the Closing,  then the parties agree
that the Cash  Amount  shall be reduced by any cash paid to  Hagadone by HPI and
any liability for amounts owed to Hagadone  related to HPI's election to pay for
the shares on an installment basis shall not be included in current  liabilities
in  determining  the Closing  Working  Capital of HPI. If HPI elects to sell its
shares in Sioux City and such transaction closes prior to the Closing,  then the
parties agree that the Cash Amount shall be increased by any cash paid to HPI by
Hagadone and any asset for amounts owed by Hagadone to HPI related to Hagadone's
election to pay for the shares on an installment  basis shall not be included in
current assets in determining  the Closing  Working Capital of HPI. If HPI sells
it shares  in Sioux  City  prior to the  Closing,  all  references  to  Acquired
Companies  shall be deemed  not to  include  Sioux  City and all  references  to
Acquired  Publications shall be deemed not to include the Sioux City Journal and
any and all  obligations  of HPI to make any  deliveries  or take any  action on
behalf of Sioux City shall be eliminated. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this  Agreement,  except as provided in this Section 6.20, the Purchaser  agrees
that the  exercise by Hagadone of its rights  under the Buy and Sell  Agreement,
dated March 1, 1992, and any  transaction  related to such  exercise,  shall not
provide the Purchaser with a basis to terminate this Agreement or to receive any
adjustment to the Stock Purchase Price.

         6.21. Additional Covenants of the HPI Stockholders and HEC.

         (a) Each of the persons listed in Schedule 6.21 hereto agrees that, for
a period of three years (the  "Restricted  Period"),  following  the date of the

any other  capacity) own,  manage,  operate,  control,  participate in, produce,
develop,  market,  distribute  and/or sell or  otherwise  carry on,  without the
Purchaser's  prior  written  consent,  during the  Restricted  Period  within or

Internet;  commercial  printing  business;  or  any  broadcast  media  business,
including commercial radio and television,  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit,
induce or attempt to solicit or induce any customer,  licensee or other business

any Subsidiary  thereof or their assigns,  or  intentionally  interfere with any
such business relation of any Acquired Company,  any Subsidiary thereof or their
assigns,  (iii) solicit or accept for  publication  or  distribution  within the
Restricted  Area  advertising,  in  any  form,  from  any  customer  or  account

in any  attempt to solicit or hire any person who was an Employee of an Acquired

Company, subsidiary or assign); provided, that nothing set forth in this Section
6.21 shall  prohibit  such  persons  from owning any  security  that is publicly
traded and  listed on any  national  stock  exchange  or on the NASDAQ  National
Market System so long as such security does not represent in excess of 5% in the
aggregate of the voting capital stock of such corporation.

         (b) The HPI Stockholders and HEC recognize that the Purchaser's and its
assigns'  business  interests  require  the  fullest  practical  protection  and
confidential  treatment  of all  information  not  generally  known  within  the
relevant  trade  group or by the  public,  including  all  documents,  writings,
memoranda, business plans, illustrations,  designs, plans, processes,  programs,

other valuable or unique information and techniques acquired,  developed or used
by any Acquired  Company,  any Subsidiary  thereof or their assigns  relating to
their  respective  business,  operations,  employees and customers  (hereinafter
collectively  termed  "Protected  Information").  The HPI  Stockholders  and HEC
expressly acknowledge and agree that the Protected Information constitutes trade
secrets and confidential and proprietary  business  information of the Purchaser
and its assigns. Protected Information shall not include information which is or
becomes part of the public domain through no breach of this Agreement by the HPI
Stockholders or HEC.  Accordingly,  the HPI  Stockholders  and HEC agree to hold
such  Protected  Information  secret  and  confidential  and to take  reasonable
precautions  such that no other Person shall, and not knowingly permit any other
Person to, directly or indirectly,  appropriate,  divulge, disclose or otherwise
disseminate to any other Person nor use in any manner for the HPI Stockholders',
HEC's or any other Person's purposes or benefit any Protected  Information,  and
not to use or aid others in using any such Protected  Information in competition
with the  Purchaser  or its  assigns,  except to the extent that  disclosure  is
required by law;  provided,  that the HPI Stockholders and HEC shall provide the
Purchaser  and its  permitted  assigns  with  notice  as far in  advance  of any
required  disclosure as is reasonably  practicable  under the  circumstances  in
order for the  Purchaser  and its assigns to obtain an order or other  assurance
that any  information  required  to be  disclosed  will be treated as  Protected
Information and the HPI Stockholders and HEC shall use all reasonable efforts to
cooperate  with the  Purchaser  and its assigns in  connection  therewith and in
furtherance  thereof.  This obligation of  non-disclosure  of information  shall
continue to exist for so long as such information remains Protected Information.
The Purchaser  agrees that the foregoing  shall not apply to the  performance by
HPI, the HPI  Stockholders and HEC of their  respective  obligations  under this
Agreement.

         (c) If, at the time of  enforcement of this Section 6.21, a court holds
that the restrictions  stated herein are unreasonable  under  circumstances then
existing,   the  parties  hereto  agree  that  the  maximum  period,   scope  or
geographical area reasonable under such  circumstances  shall be substituted for
the stated  period,  scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise
the restrictions  contained  herein to cover the maximum period,  scope and area
permitted by law.

         (d) The  Restricted  Period  shall be tolled,  with  respect to any HPI
Stockholder  or HEC, on a day-to-day  basis during which any HPI  Stockholder or
HEC is engaged, or participating in an activity prohibited herein.

         6.22.  Advertising  Contracts.  HPI  covenants  and agrees that it will
provide  to the  Purchaser  within  fifteen  (15)  days  after  the date of this
Agreement true and complete copies of the fifteen (15) largest Contracts for the

however, all HPI Excluded Liabilities.

         8.3. Procedure for  Indemnification.  The procedure for indemnification
shall be as follows:

         (a) The party or  parties  claiming  indemnification  (the  "Claimant")
shall give written notice to the party from which indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnitor")  reasonably  promptly  after the  Claimant  learns of any claim or
proceeding  covered by the foregoing  agreements to indemnify and hold harmless,
but  failure to provide  prompt  notice  shall not be deemed to  jeopardize  the
Claimant's right to demand  indemnification  if the Indemnitor is not materially
prejudiced  by the delay in receiving  notice.  If the  Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced,  the Claimant's right to indemnification  shall be reduced according
to the extent of the actual Loss or prejudice  which  Indemnitor can demonstrate
was caused by the delay. The Purchaser shall not be deemed to have notice of any
claim or proceeding by reason of any knowledge acquired on or before the Closing
Date by an  Employee,  independent  contractor  or other  agent of any  Acquired
Company.

         (b) With respect to claims  between the parties,  following  receipt of
notice from the Claimant of a claim,  the Indemnitor  shall have 30 days to make
any investigation of the claim that the Indemnitor deems necessary or desirable,
or such  lesser  time if a 30 day  period  would  jeopardize  any  rights of the
Claimant to oppose or protest the claim. For the purpose of this  investigation,
the Claimant  agrees to make  available  to the  Indemnitor  and its  authorized
representatives  the information relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate the
claim.  If the Claimant and the  Indemnitor  cannot agree as to the validity and
amount of the claim within the 30-day  period,  or lesser  period if required by
this Section (or any  mutually  agreed upon  extension  hereof) the Claimant may
seek appropriate legal remedies.

         (c) The  Indemnitor  shall have the right to  undertake,  by counsel or
other  representatives  of its own choosing,  the defense of such claim.  In the
event that the Indemnitor  shall elect not to undertake such defense,  or within
30 days after notice of such claim from the Claimant  shall fail to defend,  the
Claimant shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of such claim,  by counsel or other  representatives  of its own choosing (which
counsel  or  other   representatives  shall  be  reasonably  acceptable  to  the
Indemnitor),  on  behalf  of or for the  account  and  risk  of the  Indemnitor.
Anything in this Section 8.3 to the contrary notwithstanding,  (i) if there is a
reasonable  probability  that a claim may  materially  and adversely  affect the
Claimant  other than as a result of money damages or other money  payments,  the
Claimant  shall have the right,  at the cost and  expense  of the  Claimant,  to
participate  in the defense,  compromise or  settlement  of the claim,  (ii) the
Indemnitor shall not,  without the Claimant's  written consent (such consent not
to be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed),  settle or  compromise  any claim or
consent to entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof  the  giving by the  plaintiff  to the  Claimant  of a release  from all
Liability in respect of such claim,  and (iii) in the event that the  Indemnitor
undertakes defense of any claim consistent with this Section,  the Claimant,  by
counsel or other  representative  of its own choosing and at the reasonable cost
and expense of the Claimant, shall have the right to consult with the Indemnitor
and  its  counsel  or  other  representatives  concerning  such  claim  and  the
Indemnitor   and  the   Claimant   and  their   respective   counsel   or  other
representatives  shall cooperate with respect to such claim.  The Claimant shall
not,  without  the  Indemnitor's   written  consent  (such  consent  not  to  be
unreasonably withheld or delayed),  settle or compromise any claim or consent to
entry of any judgment,  except to the extent it releases the  Indemnitor for any
and  all  liability  related  to the  Loss  incurred  with  such  claim.  If any
disagreement  arises in the handling of the claim, the Indemnitor shall have the
right to make the final  determination  consistent with the requirements of this
Section.
<PAGE>

         (d) If there shall be any conflicts  between the  provisions of Section
8.3(c) and Section 6.13(f) (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section
6.13(f) shall control with respect to Tax contests.

         (e) The HPI Stockholders and HEC waive and release, effective as of the
Closing Date, all claims against any of the Acquired  Companies for any right to
contribution  or  indemnification  for any  indemnity  payments  made by the HPI
Stockholders or HEC after the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

         (f) The Claimant  shall use  reasonable  efforts to collect any amounts
available  under  insurance  coverage,  or from any other  Person  alleged to be
responsible,  for any Loss payable under Article 8. If the Claimant receives any
amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible  for any Loss,  subsequent to an  indemnification  payment by the
Indemnitor,  then such Claimant shall promptly  reimburse the Indemnitor for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with providing
such indemnification  payment up to the amount received by the Claimant,  net of
any expenses incurred by such Claimant in collecting such amount.

         (g) If the Claimant receives any payment from the Indemnitor in respect
of any Loss pursuant to Article 8 and the Claimant could have recovered all or a
part  of such  Loss  from a third  party  other  than  an  Acquired  Company  (a
"Potential  Contributor")  based on the  underlying  Loss  asserted  against the
Indemnitor,  the Claimant shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the
Potential  Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnitor to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

         (h) The HPI  Indemnitors,  on the one hand (in accordance  with Section
8.5(g)),  and the Purchaser,  on the other hand, shall reimburse the other party
for the Taxes for which any HPI  Indemnitor or the Purchaser,  respectively,  is
liable pursuant to Section 6.13(a) but which are shown to be due on and required
to be remitted  with  respect to any Tax Return to be filed by the  Purchaser or
the HPI Stockholders Representative,  respectively,  pursuant to Section 6.13(b)
upon the written  request of the party  entitled to  payment,  setting  forth in
detail the  computation  of the amount owed by the other party,  but in no event
shall  payment be required  earlier than five (5) days prior to the due date for
remitting  such Taxes.  This  Section  8.3(h) shall apply only in the context of
filing Tax Returns for current Taxes payable  pursuant to Section  6.13(b),  and
shall not apply in the case of  amounts  payable by the HPI  Indemnitors  to the
Purchaser,  or the  Purchaser to the HPI  Indemnitors,  as the case may be, as a
result of an action, suit, investigation,  audit, claim, assessment, amended Tax
Return, or other similar context,  which in general shall be governed by Section
6.13  (other  than  Section  6.13(c))  and by this  Section 8.3 (other than this
Section 8.3(h)).

         8.4.  Sole  Remedy.  Each  party  agrees  that the sole  Liability  and
obligations  of the other party and the sole right,  remedy and  entitlement  of
each party for recovery of any monetary  claim with respect to or in  connection
with this Agreement or any of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement
shall be limited to  indemnification  under this Article 8, and all such parties
hereby  waive any and all other  statutory  and common  law rights and  remedies
(including  rights  of  indemnification  and  contribution)  which it has or may
hereafter  have against any other party,  provided  such waiver (i) shall not be
construed to prevent any party hereto from seeking specific performance or other
equitable  relief or remedies and (ii) shall not  terminate or release any right
to  indemnification  any HPI Stockholder  may have against any Acquired  Company
relating to such HPI Stockholder  serving as a director,  officer or employee of
such Acquired  Company.  If the Closing occurs,  the rights and claims waived by
the  Purchaser  include  claims for  contribution  or other  rights of  recovery
arising  out of or  relating  to any  Environmental  Law,  claims  for breach of
contract, breach of representation or warranty,  negligent misrepresentation and
all other claims for breach of duty.

         8.5. Limitations on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy.

         (a) No claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.2(a)
for breach of any  representation  or warranty shall be valid unless made within
the applicable Survival Period as defined in Section 8.6.

         (b) No party shall be obligated to indemnify any other party or parties
under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.2(a) unless the Claimant's aggregate amount of
Losses as to which a right of  indemnification  is provided under Section 8.1(a)
or Section 8.2(a) shall exceed $3,000,000, in which event $2,000,000 plus all of
such  Losses  above  $3,000,000  shall  be  indemnifiable;   provided  that  the
Purchaser's   right  to  recover  under   Section   8.1(a)  for  breach  of  any
representation  or warranty  contained in Sections  4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 shall not be
subject to such limitation.
<PAGE>

         (c) No individual  breach of any such  representation or warranty shall
be deemed to have occurred  unless the actual Loss incurred as a result  thereof
is in excess of $3,000.  In no event shall the  aggregate  liability  of the HPI
Indemnitors pursuant to Section 8.1(a) exceed $50,000,000, which amount shall be
reduced on the date that is six (6) days after the six-month  anniversary of the
Closing Date to $35,000,000  and reduced on the date that is the  eighteen-month
anniversary of the Closing Date to $15,000,000  except that the reduction of the
aggregate  liability  limit on the  six-month and  eighteen-month  anniversaries
shall not otherwise limit the Purchaser's entitlement to indemnification for any
Loss for which a proper notice of claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a)
was given prior to the six-month or eighteen-month  anniversary,  as applicable,
but which  remained  unresolved  at the time the  liability  limit  was  reduced
(provided that the HPI Indemnitors'  liability for breach of any  representation
or warranty  contained in Sections  4.1,  4.2, 4.3,  4.5(b),  4.11(b),  4.16 or,
subject to Section 4.19(c), 4.19 shall not be subject to such limitation). In no
event shall the  aggregate  liability  of the HPI  Indemnitors  pursuant to this
Agreement exceed the Stock Purchase Price less the Cash Amount and the aggregate
liability of the Purchaser  pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Stock Purchase
Price less the Cash Amount.

         (d) The indemnity  payment  hereunder with respect to any Loss shall be
calculated  on an  "After-Tax  Basis",  which  shall  mean an  amount  which  is
sufficient  to  compensate  the  Claimant for the event giving rise to such Loss
(the  "Indemnified  Event"),  determined  after  taking  into  account  (1)  all
increases in federal,  state,  local or other Taxes (including  estimated Taxes)
payable by the Claimant as a result of the receipt of the indemnity  payment (as
a result of the indemnity  payment being  included in income but not as a result
of a reduction of tax basis); provided,  however, that for all federal and state
Income Tax purposes, the Purchaser and the HPI Stockholders agree to report each
indemnification  payment made by or to either of them in respect of a Loss as an
adjustment to the Stock Purchase  Price,  and the parties hereto agree to report
each  indemnification  payment to the Purchaser by HEC in respect of a Loss as a
decrease in the amount  realized by the HPI  Stockholders in the HPI Redemption,
unless there is a Final Determination to the contrary affecting the Claimant (it
being understood that if any reporting  position is later disallowed as a result
of a Final  Determination,  the Indemnitor  shall indemnify the Claimant for the
effects  of  such  disallowance,  and  it  being  further  understood  that  the
obligations  under this  parenthetical  clause  shall  remain in effect  without
limitation as to time),  (2) to the extent not previously  taken into account in
computing the amount of such Loss,  all increases in federal,  state,  local and
other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Claimant for all affected
taxable years or periods  ending on or before the Closing Date and, with respect
to any  Straddle  Period,  the  portion  of the  Straddle  Period  ending on and
including the Closing Date as a result of the Indemnified  Event, and (3) to the
extent not  previously  taken into account in  computing  the amount of the such
Loss,  all  reductions in federal,  state,  local and foreign  Taxes  (including
estimated  Taxes)  realized by the Claimant for all affected  taxable  years and
periods as a result of the Indemnified  Event. All calculations shall be made at
the time of the relevant  indemnification  payment using reasonable  assumptions
(as agreed to by the  indemnifying  and  indemnified  party) and  present  value
concepts  (using a discount rate equal to the applicable  federal rate in effect
at the time of the Indemnified  Event (based on the Federal mid-term rate) using
semi-annual compounding plus four (4) percentage points).

         (e) With  respect  to any claims for  indemnification  arising  from or
related  to  Environmental  Law  or  Hazardous  Materials   Activity,   the  HPI
Indemnitors  shall have no  liability  under this Article 8 if any such claim is
triggered by an environmental  investigation  undertaken by the Purchaser (other
than an  investigation  undertaken in  connection  with a financing or sale of a
property),  or any  notification  by the  Purchaser (or its  affiliates)  to any
Governmental Authority, unless such investigation or notification is required by
Environmental  Law. If any Remedial Action is required by  Environmental  Law in
order to correct or cure a violation of any Environmental Law or any third party
demand, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the HPI Stockholders  Representative
after  acquiring  knowledge of such  requirement and shall present a remediation
plan to the HPI Stockholders  Representative  at least ninety (90) days prior to
performing such Remedial Action (unless a Governmental  Authority  requires that
the Purchaser or an Acquired Company take such action in a shorter period).  The
remediation  plan shall be  designed  to minimize  the  remediation  cost to the
extent feasible while providing for a reasonable and customary level of clean-up
in compliance with applicable Environmental Law. Unless the Purchaser is ordered
to perform such remediation or other work by any Governmental Authority, the HPI
Stockholders  Representative  shall have  thirty (30) days to review and approve
the remediation  plan, the approval of which cannot be unreasonably  withheld or
delayed.
<PAGE>

         (f) If the  Purchaser  acquires  Knowledge  prior to  Closing  that any
representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement of the HPI Stockholders, HPI or
HEC contained in this Agreement or any of the Schedules attached hereto has been
breached,  is false or requires  modification  or amendment  to be correct,  the
Purchaser  shall  notify  in  writing  the  HPI  Stockholders,  HPI or  HEC  (as
applicable)  as soon as  practicable,  but in any event within five (5) Business
Days after acquiring such  Knowledge.  Subject to Section 6.11, if the Purchaser
acquires Knowledge prior to Closing that any representation,  warranty, covenant
or agreement of the HPI Stockholders,  HPI or HEC contained in this Agreement or
any of the Schedules  attached  hereto has been  breached,  is false or requires
modification  or amendment to be correct and the  Purchaser has failed to notify
the HPI Stockholders of such Knowledge prior to the Closing,  then the Purchaser
shall have no right or remedy after the Closing with respect to such  inaccuracy
or breach and shall be deemed to have  waived its rights to  indemnification  in
respect  thereof  and any  Loss in  respect  thereof  shall be  disregarded  for
purposes of the threshold and deductible contained in Section 8.5(b).

         (g) With  respect to any  indemnification  pursuant to Section  8.1(a),
indemnification  by the HPI  Indemnifying  Stockholders  shall be several in the
proportions  set  forth  in  Schedule  8.5(g)  and  not  joint.   The  Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the exclusive  source of any amounts  determined to
be payable to it for an inaccuracy of a  representation  or breach of a warranty
pursuant  to Section  8.1(a)  hereof  (other  than  liability  for breach of any
representation or warranty contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5(b), 4.11(b),
4.16 and, subject to Section  4.19(c),  4.19, which shall not be subject to such
limitation)  shall be the  Escrow  Amount,  pursuant  to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.  With respect to any  indemnification  pursuant to Section  8.1(b) or
(c), the Purchaser shall first seek  indemnification from HEC. To the extent HEC
fails to satisfy its  indemnification  obligations in respect  thereof,  the HPI
Indemnifying  Stockholders  shall severally and not jointly indemnify for Losses
incurred  pursuant to Sections  8.1(b) and (c) in the  proportions  set forth in
Schedule 8.5(g).

         (h) The Indemnitor shall not be liable under Article 8 for any (1) Loss
relating to any matter to the extent  that there is included in the  calculation
of Closing  Working Capital of HPI a specific  liability or reserve  relating to
such  matter,  but only to the  extent of such  reserve,  (2)  consequential  or
punitive Loss (other than a consequential or punitive Loss payable in connection
with a third  Person  Action),  or (3) Loss for lost  profits  (other  than lost
profits payable in connection with a third Person Action).

         (i) The parties hereto  acknowledge  and agree that, in the case of the
breach of any representation or warranty,  covenant or agreement with respect to
any asset, obligation,  liability or other condition of Sioux City, the Loss for
which the HPI Indemnitors shall be required to indemnify  pursuant to Article 8,
subject to all of the other limitations and conditions contained in this Article
8, shall not  exceed 50% (i.e.,  the  ownership  percentage  of HPI,  direct and
indirect,  in Sioux  City) of the Loss  incurred by Sioux City by reason of such
breach.

         (j) The Purchaser  acknowledges and agrees that,  except as provided in
Section  6.11,  no item  disclosed to the  Purchaser in any closing  certificate
delivered to the  Purchaser  or otherwise in respect of Section  7.1(a) shall be
the subject of  indemnification  under this  Article 8 and any Loss  incurred in
respect  thereof  shall  be  disregarded  for  purposes  of  the  threshold  and
deductible contained in Section 8.5(b).

         8.6.  Survival.  Subject  to the  provisions  of  Section  8.5(f),  all
representations,  warranties,  covenants  and  agreements of the parties made in
this Agreement or the Escrow  Agreement shall survive the Closing  regardless of
any investigation or inquiry on the part of any party, and the Closing shall not
be deemed a waiver by any party of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements  of any  other  party  in this  Agreement  or the  Escrow  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that the period of survival  shall (i) with  respect to the
representations  and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5(b),  5.1, 5.2 and
5.3,  continue  indefinitely;  (ii)  with  respect  to the  representations  and
warranties in Section  4.19,  but subject to Section  4.19(c),  continue for the
applicable   statutory   limitation   period;   (iii)   with   respect   to  the
representations  and warranties in Sections 4.11(b) and 4.16, end five (5) years
after the Closing  Date;  and (iv) in the case of any other  representation  and
warranty,  end  three  (3)  years  after the  Closing  Date (in each  case,  the
"Survival Period"). No claim for breach of any representation or warranty may be
brought under this  Agreement  unless  written  notice  describing in reasonable
detail  the  nature and basis of such claim is given on or prior to the last day
of the applicable  Survival Period.  In the event such notice of such a claim is
so given, the right to indemnification  with respect to such claim shall survive
the  applicable  Survival  Period  until the claim is finally  resolved  and any
obligations  with respect to the claim are fully  satisfied.  All  covenants and
agreements  under this  Agreement  and the Escrow  Agreement  shall  survive the
Closing for the applicable statutory limitation period.

                                   TERMINATION

         9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:

         (a) By either the HPI  Stockholders  Representative,  acting in his own
right or on behalf of HEC or each Acquired Company, or the Purchaser at any time
prior to the Closing with the mutual written consent of the other party hereto;

         (b)  Unless  the  Closing  has not  occurred  as a result of a material
breach of this  Agreement by the party  seeking such  termination  or any of its
Affiliates,  by either the HPI Stockholders  Representative  or the Purchaser if
the Closing has not  occurred on or prior to 5:00 p.m.  CST on the date which is
three (3) months following the date of this Agreement (the "Termination  Date");
provided,  however,  that  either  the HPI  Stockholders  Representative  or the
Purchaser in his or its sole discretion may elect to extend the Termination Date
until 5:00 p.m.  (CST time) on the date which is four (4) months  following  the
date of this Agreement by written notice to the other at least ten (10) calendar
days prior to the initial Termination Date;

         (c) By either the HPI Stockholders  Representative  or the Purchaser if
any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued
a final and nonappealable Governmental Order permanently restraining,  enjoining
or otherwise  prohibiting the consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement;   provided,   however,   that  neither  the  HPI   Stockholders
Representative  nor the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this
Section  9.1(c) unless the party seeking to so terminate this Agreement has used
with its Affiliates all commercially  reasonable best efforts to oppose any such
Governmental   Order  or  to  have  such  Governmental  Order  vacated  or  made
inapplicable to the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement,  but nothing
contained  in this  Section  9.1(c)  shall  prevent  a party  that is  otherwise
entitled to terminate this  Agreement  pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(d) from
doing so;

         (d) If the Closing  has not  occurred,  by either the HPI  Stockholders
Representative  or the Purchaser,  if such party and its Affiliates are not then
in  material  breach  of  this  Agreement,  if  the  other  party  or any of its
Affiliates  has continued in material  breach of this  Agreement for thirty (30)
days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the terminating  party,
and such breach is not cured  within  such  thirty  (30) day  period;  provided,
however, that if a party or any of its Affiliates has undertaken but is not able
to cure such breach within thirty (30) days, despite its good faith efforts, the
party and its Affiliates  shall have such  additional  time as may be reasonably
necessary to effectuate a cure if such breach is capable of being cured,  but in
no event more than an additional sixty (60) days; or

         (e) By the Purchaser or the HPI Stockholders Representative if entitled
to do so under Section 6.11.

         9.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1  hereof,  neither  party  hereto  shall have any  further  Liability
hereunder except that (i) the provisions of Sections 6.7 and 6.8, and Articles 9
and 10 shall  remain in full force and effect,  and (ii) each party hereto shall
remain liable to each other party hereto for any breach of its obligations under
this Agreement prior to such termination.

Any such  notice or other  communication  will be deemed to have been  given and
received  (whether  actually  received  or  not)  on the  day  it is  personally
delivered  or  delivered  by courier or  overnight  delivery  service or sent by
telecopy (receipt confirmed) or, if mailed, when actually received.

         10.2. Actions of the HPI Stockholders Representative.

         (a) Any and all  actions to be taken under or in  connection  with this
Agreement  and  the  HPI  Stockholder  Documents  by or on  behalf  of  the  HPI
Stockholders  may  be  so  taken  by  the  HPI  Stockholders  Representative  as
attorney-in-fact  for the HPI  Stockholders.  Any  action  so  taken  by the HPI
Stockholders  Representative  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  taken,  and the
Purchaser  may  rely  on any  such  action  as  having  been  taken,  by the HPI
Stockholders.   Each  HPI  Stockholder  hereby  appoints  the  HPI  Stockholders
Representative as such HPI Stockholder's true and lawful attorney  authorized on
behalf of such HPI Stockholder  and in such HPI  Stockholder's  name,  place and
stead,  acting  jointly or severally,  to amend and update this Agreement and to
complete, date, execute, deliver, amend and update each HPI Stockholder Document
and each  other  document  or  instrument  contemplated  by the HPI  Stockholder
Document,  and otherwise to act as attorney-in-fact  for such HPI Stockholder in
connection  with  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  Each HPI
Stockholder  agrees that the power of attorney  created by this  Section 10.2 is
irrevocable and will not be modified in a manner which is inconsistent  with the
preceding  sentences of this Section 10.2 without the prior  written  consent of
all the HPI Stockholders.

         (b)  It is  understood  and  agreed  by  the  Purchaser  that  the  HPI
Stockholders  Representative  is acting  solely as a  representative  of the HPI
Stockholders  and, when acting in such capacity,  has no liability or obligation
with  respect to any  representation,  warranty,  covenant or  agreement  of the
Acquired Companies,  the HPI Stockholders or HEC in this Agreement or any of the
HPI Stockholder Documents,  or with respect to any action taken or omitted to be
taken in connection with the transactions contemplated herein and therein.
<PAGE>

         (c) If  neither  Robert S.  Howard  nor  William  E.  Howard is able or
willing to act as the HPI  Stockholders  Representative,  then David B.  Howard,
Thomas W. Howard and Andrea H. Palmer by majority vote shall appoint another HPI
Stockholder  as  the  HPI  Stockholders   Representative   to  act  as  the  HPI
Stockholders Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Such Person
shall  thereafter  be referred  to as the HPI  Stockholders  Representative  for
purposes of this Agreement.

         10.3.  Amendments  and Waiver.  This  Agreement  may not be modified or
amended  except in  writing  signed by the party  against  whom  enforcement  is
sought.  The terms of this Agreement may be waived only by a written  instrument
signed by the party  waiving  compliance.  No  waiver of any  provision  of this
Agreement  shall be deemed or shall  constitute a waiver of any other  provision
hereof (whether or not similar),  nor shall such waiver  constitute a continuing
waiver unless  otherwise  provided.  No delay on the part of any party hereto in
exercising  any right,  power or privilege  hereunder  shall operate as a waiver
thereof,  nor shall any  single  or  partial  exercise  of any  right,  power or
privilege  hereunder  preclude  any other or  further  exercise  thereof  or the
exercise of any other right,  power or  privilege  hereunder.  Unless  otherwise
provided  in this  Agreement,  the  rights  and  remedies  herein  provided  are
cumulative  and are not  exclusive  of any rights or remedies  which the parties
hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity.  Whenever this Agreement requires
or permits  consent by or on behalf of a party,  such consent  shall be given in
writing in a manner  consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance
as set forth in this Section 10.3.

         10.4.  Assignment.  Neither  this  Agreement  nor  any of  the  rights,
interests  or  obligations  hereunder  may be assigned or  delegated  by the HPI
Stockholders  or the Purchaser  without the prior  written  consent of the other
party and any purported  assignment  or delegation in violation  hereof shall be
null and void; provided,  however,  that the Purchaser may assign this Agreement
or any or all rights or obligations  hereunder  (including,  without limitation,
the  Purchaser's  rights to purchase,  the HPI Common Stock and the  Purchaser's
rights  to  seek  indemnification   hereunder)  to  any  wholly-owned  corporate
subsidiary  of the  Purchaser  formed  under the laws of any state in the United
States  of  America  and  any  HPI  Stockholder  may  transfer  to  another  HPI
Stockholder shares of HPI Common Stock;  provided,  further, that any assignment
by the  Purchaser  shall not  release  the  Purchaser  from any  liabilities  or
obligations  under this  Agreement.  Upon any such  permitted  assignment by the
Purchaser, the references in this Agreement to the Purchaser shall also apply to
any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

         10.5. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Confidentiality  Agreement
and the  related  documents  contained  as  Exhibits  and  Schedules  hereto  or
expressly  contemplated  hereby  (including  the Escrow  Agreement)  contain the
entire  understanding  of the parties  relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior written or oral and all contemporaneous  oral agreements and
understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. The Exhibits and Schedules
to this Agreement are hereby  incorporated  by reference into and made a part of
this Agreement for all purposes.

         10.6.  Representations and Warranties  Complete.  The  representations,
warranties,  covenants and  agreements set forth in this  Agreement,  the Escrow
Agreement and the Confidentiality  Agreement constitute all the representations,
warranties,  covenants and agreements of the parties hereto and their respective
shareholders,  directors, officers, employees,  Affiliates,  advisors (including
financial, legal and accounting),  agents and representatives and upon which the
parties have relied.

         10.7.  Third Party  Beneficiaries.  This Agreement is made for the sole
benefit  of the  parties  hereto,  their  respective  successors  and  permitted
assigns,  and nothing  contained herein,  express or implied,  is intended to or
shall  confer  upon any other  Person any third party  beneficiary  right or any
other legal or equitable  rights,  benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

         10.8.  Governing  Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
and  interpreted  in  accordance  with  the  substantive  laws of the  State  of
Illinois,  without  giving effect to any conflicts of law rule or principle that
might require the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.
<PAGE>

         10.9.  Jurisdiction.  Except as  otherwise  expressly  provided in this
Agreement,  the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking
to  enforce  any  provision  of,  or based on any  matter  arising  out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought in any Federal or any state court sitting in Chicago,  so long as one of
such courts shall have subject  matter  jurisdiction  over such suit,  action or
proceeding,  and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have arisen from a  transaction  of business in the State of Illinois,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably  consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the  appropriate  appellate  courts  therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably  waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any  suit,  action or  proceeding  in any such  court or that any such  suit,
action or  proceeding  which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served
on any party anywhere in the world,  whether within or without the  jurisdiction
of any court. Without limiting the foregoing,  each party agrees that service of
process on such party as  provided  in  Section  10.1 shall be deemed  effective
service of process on such party.

         10.10.  WAIVER  OF  JURY  TRIAL.  EACH  OF THE  PARTIES  HERETO  HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES  ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL  PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

         10.11. Neutral  Construction.  The parties to this Agreement agree that
this Agreement was  negotiated  fairly between them at arms' length and that the
final terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties' negotiations. Each
party  represents  and warrants that it has sought and received legal counsel of
its own choosing  with regard to the contents of this  Agreement  and the rights
and obligations  affected hereby. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them, and that the provisions
of this Agreement  therefore should not be construed  against a party or parties
on the grounds  that the party or parties  drafted or was more  responsible  for
drafting the provision(s).

         10.12.  Severability.  In  the  event  that  any  one  or  more  of the
provisions  or parts of a provision  contained in this  Agreement  shall for any
reason be held to be  invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable  in any respect in any
jurisdiction,  such invalidity,  illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any  other  provision  or part of a  provision  of this  Agreement  or any other
jurisdiction,  but this  Agreement  shall be reformed and  construed in any such
jurisdiction as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision or part of
a provision had never been contained  herein and such provision or part shall be
reformed so that it would be valid,  legal and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted in such jurisdiction.

         10.13. Headings; Interpretation; Schedules and Exhibits.

         (a) The  descriptive  headings of the several  Articles and Sections of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of
this Agreement.  References to Sections or Articles, unless otherwise indicated,
are references to Sections and Articles of this Agreement.  The word "including"
means  including  without  limitation.  Words  (including  defined terms) in the
singular  shall be held to  include  the  plural and vice versa and words of one
gender  shall be held to include the other gender as the context  requires.  The
terms  "hereof,"  "herein" and  "herewith"  and words of similar  import  shall,
unless  otherwise  stated,  be construed  to refer to this  Agreement as a whole
(including  all of the Schedules and Exhibits  hereto) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement  unless  otherwise  specified.  It is understood and
agreed that neither the  specifications  of any dollar amount in this  Agreement
nor the  inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules or Exhibits is intended
to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts,  or the items so included
or other  items,  are or are not  material,  and no party  shall use the fact of
setting  of such  amounts  or the  fact  of the  inclusion  of such  item in the
Schedules  or Exhibits in any dispute or  controversy  between the parties as to
whether  any  obligation,  item or matter  is or is not  material  for  purposes
hereof.

         (b) Whenever an Acquired  Company is called upon to list any  contracts
or agreements, there shall be deemed excluded from the applicable representation
or warranty any agreement  where the obligations of all the parties thereto have
been  performed  or will be  performed  before  the  Closing  Date.  Whenever  a
representation  or warranty is made  regarding an Acquired  Company,  unless the
context otherwise requires,  such representation and warranty shall be deemed to
be only with  respect to the  Acquired  Company  and not any  Subsidiary  of the
Acquired Company.
<PAGE>

         (c) Certain  matters and items disclosed in any Schedule or Exhibit may
not be  required  to be  disclosed  therein,  but may be  disclosed  therein for
informational  purposes  only,  and  no  such  disclosure  shall  constitute  an
indication  or  admission  of the  materiality  thereof or create a standard  of
disclosure.

         (d) If any  fact or item is  included  on a  Schedule  referenced  by a
particular  section in this  Agreement  and the existence of the fact or item or
its  contents is relevant to any other  section in this  Agreement,  the fact or
item shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to such other section  whether
or not an explicit cross-reference appears in the Schedules if such relevance is
readily apparent from examination of the Schedules.

         10.14.  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed in one or more
counterparts  for the  convenience  of the parties hereto each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which  together will  constitute  one and the same
instrument.  Signatures  to faxed copies of this  Agreement  shall be binding so
long as  original  counterparts  thereof  are  provided  to the other  party via
overnight delivery service received within three (3) business days thereafter.

         10.15.  Cooperation.  From and after the Closing,  the  Purchaser  will
cooperate with the HPI  Stockholders  and HEC in the  investigation,  defense or
prosecution  of any Action  which is pending or  threatened  against an Acquired
Company  or any of its  Affiliates,  whether or not any party has  notified  the
other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without limiting the
generality of the  foregoing,  the Purchaser  will make  available its Employees
employed by the Purchaser to give  depositions or testimony and will furnish all
documentary or other evidence in each case as the HPI  Stockholders  and HEC may
reasonably  request.  The HPI Stockholders and HEC shall reimburse the Purchaser
for all reasonable and necessary  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred in connection
with the performance of their obligations under this Section 10.15.

         10.16.  Specific  Performance.  The  HPI  Stockholders,   HPI  and  HEC
acknowledge  that each of the  Acquired  Companies  is of a special,  unique and
extraordinary  character,  and that damages alone are an inadequate remedy for a
breach of this Agreement by the HPI Stockholders, HPI or HEC. Accordingly, as an
alternative to termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1, if the Purchaser
is not then in material default hereunder,  the Purchaser shall be entitled,  in
the event of breach of this  Agreement  by any of the HPI  Stockholders,  HPI or
HEC, to  enforcement  of this  Agreement  (subject  to  obtaining  any  required
approval  under the HSR Act) by a decree of specific  performance  or injunctive
relief requiring any of the HPI Stockholders, HPI or HEC to fulfill their or its
obligations  under  this  Agreement.  Such  right  of  specific  performance  or
injunctive  relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the  Purchaser's
right to recover  damages  and to pursue  any other  remedies  available  to the
Purchaser  for any such  breach.  In any  action  to  specifically  enforce  the
obligation of any of the HPI Stockholders,  HPI or HEC to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  the HPI  Stockholders,  HPI and HEC shall waive
the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law or in equity and agrees that
the Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain specific performance of the obligation
to close  without  being  required to prove  actual  damages.  As a condition to
seeking specific performance,  the Purchaser shall not be required to tender the
Cash Payment but shall be required to  demonstrate  that the Purchaser is ready,
willing and able to tender the Cash Payment as prescribed in this Agreement.

                            [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]
