(b) _Determination of Conclusive Net Working Capital_. Sellers will have 45
calendar days following the receipt of the Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Statement to review the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement and
Transferred Cash Statement. During such time, Sellers may dispute any items
set forth on the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement (or specific
calculations or methods contemplated thereby) and the Transferred Cash
Statement. Unless Sellers deliver written notice to Buyer of dispute thereof
on or prior to the 45th calendar day after Sellers receipt of the Post-
Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Transferred Cash Statement,
Sellers will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and Transferred Cash Statement and such
statements (and the specific calculations or methods contemplated thereby)
will be final, binding and conclusive. If Sellers notify Buyer in writing of
disputed items contained in the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement (or
specific calculations or methods contemplated thereby) or Transferred

 



26  Cash Statement (the " _Disputed Items_ ") within such 45 calendar day
period, for 30 calendar days following delivery of such notice by Sellers to
Buyer (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Buyer and Sellers will attempt in good
faith to resolve their differences with respect to the Disputed Items. Upon
delivery of any such notice of Disputed Items by Sellers, Sellers will be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to all items on the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and Transferred Cash Statement (and the specific
calculations or methods contemplated thereby) other than the Disputed Items,
and such items (and the specific calculations or methods contemplated
thereby) other than the Disputed Items will be final, binding and conclusive.
Any resolution by Buyer and Sellers during the Resolution Period as to any
Disputed Items will be set forth in writing and will be final, binding
and conclusive. If Buyer and Sellers do not resolve all Disputed Items by the
end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining in dispute
will be submitted by either one of the Parties within 30 calendar days after
the expiration of the Resolution Period to such national independent
accounting firm with international reputation and familiar with the sector or
industry of the Business mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers (the "
_Neutral Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Arbitrator will act as an arbitrator to
determine only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute as of the end of the
Resolution Period. In resolving such Disputed Items, the Neutral Arbitrator
may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value
for such Disputed Item claimed by any Party or less than the lowest value for
such Disputed Item claimed by any Party. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator will be allocated and
borne between Buyer and Sellers in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the
Neutral Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such Disputed Items so
submitted. In addition, without limiting _Section 6.4_, Buyer and Sellers
will give the Neutral Arbitrator access to all Records, facilities and
personnel of such Party and its Affiliates and Representatives as is
reasonably necessary to perform its function as arbitrator. Buyer and Sellers
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Neutral Arbitrator
to deliver to Buyer and Sellers a written determination (such determination
to include an explanation in reasonable detail of the reasons for such
determination and a work sheet setting forth all material calculations and
methods used in arriving at such determination) of the Disputed
Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator and the resulting effect thereof on
the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement and Transferred Cash Statement
within 60 calendar days of receipt of such Disputed Items, which determination
will, in the absence of manifest error, be final, binding and conclusive and
upon which judgment may be entered. The final, binding and conclusive Post-
Closing Net Working Capital Statement and Transferred Cash Statement based
either upon agreement or deemed agreement by Buyer and Sellers or the written
determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this
_Section 2.10(b)_ will be the " _Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement_ ,"
and " _Conclusive Transferred Cash Statement_ ," respectively.

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the amount of the (i) Net Working Capital
set forth on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement exceeds the Target
Net Working Capital Amount, and/or (ii) the amount of Transferred Cash exceeds
the Initial Transferred Cash Amount, Buyer will pay Sellers the amount of the
respective excess. If the (iii) Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the
amount of the Net Working Capital set forth on the Conclusive Net Working
Capital Statement, and/or (iv) the Initial Transferred Cash Amount exceeds the
Transferred Cash, Sellers will pay Buyer the amount of the respective excess.
All payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.10(c)_ will be made no
later than the fifth

 



27  Business Day following the date on which Buyer and Sellers agree, or are
deemed to have agreed to, or the Neutral Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive
Net Working Capital Statement and Conclusive Transferred Cash Statement.

Section 2.11 _Allocation_. Buyer and Sellers agree to allocate the Purchase
Price (as finally determined hereunder), and the Assumed Liabilities and all
other relevant items, in accordance with _Annex G_ (the " _Preliminary
Purchase Price Allocation_ "). No later than 60 days after the Purchase Price
is finally determined hereunder, Sellers will deliver to Buyer an allocation
of the Purchase Price, and the Assumed Liabilities and all other relevant
items, as of the Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with the
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ")
and Sellers will reasonably consider such revisions to the Purchase Price
Allocation as are reasonably requested by Buyer. If Sellers decline to make a
revision to the Purchase Price Allocation requested by Buyer and Buyer
disagrees with the Sellers determination, Buyer and Sellers shall submit the
disputed item to the Neutral Arbitrator for determination under procedures
similar to those set forth in _Section 2.10(b)_. The final binding and
conclusive Purchase Price Allocation based upon either the agreement by Buyer
and Sellers or the written determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator
in accordance with this _Section 2.11_ and the relevant provisions of 
_Section 2.10(b)_ will be the "Conclusive Purchase Price Allocation." The
Conclusive Purchase Price Allocation shall be in accordance with relevant
provisions of law, including Section 1060 of the IRC in respect of the US DAT
Business and BFS Equity. The Conclusive Purchase Price Allocation will be
conclusive and binding on the Parties, and Buyer and Sellers agree (and agree
to cause their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates) to prepare and file all
Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Conclusive Purchase Price
Allocation, unless otherwise required by law. None of the Parties will take
any position inconsistent with the Conclusive Purchase Price Allocation on any

Section 2.12 _Non-Transferability_. Nothing contained herein will be deemed
by any Seller or Buyer to constitute an agreement of any Seller to assign or
transfer any Transferred Contract or other Acquired Asset to Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby if an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof without the consent of or notice to a third
party thereto would constitute a breach or default thereof and such consent
has not been obtained or provided. In the event that any Transferred Contract
or Acquired Asset cannot be assigned or transferred because the required
consent or notice to the third party thereto has not been obtained or
provided, the relevant Seller, as appropriate, will be deemed to be Buyers
duly appointed agent for the purpose of completing, fulfilling
and discharging all of Buyers rights and Liabilities arising after the
Closing Date with respect to each such Transferred Contract or Acquired Asset.
Sellers will be entitled to charge and collect from, Buyer for all reasonable
incremental costs associated with the retention, maintenance and enforcement
of rights of each Transferred Contract or other Acquired Asset and all
Liabilities arising thereunder to the extent related to the ownership, use or
operation thereof from and after the Closing Date contemplated by this
_Section 2.12_ (the " _Maintenance Costs_ "), and Buyer will indemnify each
Seller Indemnified Party for any Damages resulting from or arising out of any
such activities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 2.12_, no Seller will have any obligation whatsoever under this
_Section 2.12_ beyond the earlier to occur of (i) 150 days after the Closing
Date, or (ii) the date on which it is reasonably apparent that the
counterparty will continue to fulfill its obligations under such Transferred
Contract without objection to the assignment.

 



28 Section 2.13 _No Partial Transfer_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
transfer of the Business contemplated by this Agreement is indivisible
("ondeelbaar"). The transfer of the Business may not be completed in part and
shall be valid only if it bears on the entire Business, without prejudice to
the provisions of  _Sections 2.12_ and _6.2_. No partial enforcement of the
transfer of the Business contemplated by this Agreement and the Local Transfer
Agreements shall be allowed.

 

Section 2.14 _Multi-Site Contracts_.

material to the Business and as to which the Parties have agreed to equitably
allocate the rights and obligations arising thereunder (the " _Shared Multi-
Site Contracts,_ ") it being understood that no additional consideration will
be owing by Buyer to Sellers in respect of such allocation of the Shared
Multi-Site Contracts.

(b) With respect to each such Shared Multi-Site Contract, (i) the Parties
shall cooperate with each other and each Multi-Site Contract counterparty in
such allocation and (ii) the Parties shall use their Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to split the Shared Multi-Site Contract on terms reasonably
acceptable to the Parties, but the Parties acknowledge that the portion of
such Contracts allocated to Buyer may not include any group discounts or
similar benefits specific to Sellers or their Affiliates. Completion of
documentation of any such allocation is not a condition to Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to each such Shared Multi-Site Contract which
is not split prior to Closing pursuant to subsection  _(ii)_ of this
_Section 2.14(b)_, the Parties shall cooperate to the extent feasible in
effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement under which Buyer
shall receive the allocable benefits thereunder from and after Closing, and
to the extent of the allocable benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform
Sellers obligations arising thereunder from and after Closing in accordance
with its terms, until new documentation effecting the allocation described in
this _Section 2.14_ is executed and delivered. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers for any Damages associated with the performance of Buyer for
the portion allocated to Buyer, and Sellers shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer for any Damages associated with the performance of Sellers for
the portion allocated to Sellers.

(c) In the event that the terms of any Shared Multi-Site Contract prohibits
the allocation contemplated by this _Section 2.14_, the Parties shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide the benefits and obligations of the
portion of the Shared Multi-Site Contract that would have been allocated to
Buyer but for any such prohibition.

and the Related Agreements.

materially delay such other Partys ability to consummate, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including taking any action that is intended or would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to any Partys
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in

Parties informed in all material respects of any material communication

including in connection with any proceeding by a private party. The
foregoing obligations in this _Section 5.2(b)_ will be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and any attorney-client, work product or other
privilege.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.2(b)_, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Antitrust Law, or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Authority or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law, or if a filing pursuant to  _Section 5.2(a)_
is reasonably likely to be rejected or conditioned by a Governmental
Authority, each of the Parties will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
resolve such objections or challenges as such Governmental Authority
or private party may have to such transactions, including to vacate, lift,
reverse or overturn any order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, so
as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable and in any event on or prior to the Outside Date.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer will promptly take and
diligently pursue any or all of the following actions to the extent necessary
to eliminate any concerns on the part of, or to satisfy any conditions
imposed by, any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement
of any applicable law, including any Antitrust Law, regarding the legality of
Buyers acquisition of any portion of the Acquired Equity, Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities:

(i) using its best efforts to prevent the entry in a judicial or
administrative proceeding brought under any law, including any Antitrust Law,
by any Governmental Authority or any other Person of any permanent, temporary
or preliminary injunction or other order that would make consummation of the
acquisition of the Business or any portion thereof, the Acquired Equity, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay such consummation; and

 

(ii) taking promptly and pursuing diligently, in the event that an injunction

such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation as promptly as
possible.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Buyer be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or
condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or to
accept any operational restriction that would materially limit its rights to
own or operate its businesses or assets, including, after Closing, the
Business.

 



51 Section 5.3 _Notices and Consents_. Prior to the Closing and as necessary
following the Closing:

(a) Sellers will, or will cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to, give any notices
to third parties, and each of the Parties will use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain any third party consents or sublicenses, in
connection with the matters referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule or as are otherwise necessary and appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Without prejudice to the generality of the forgoing, each Party will
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts and cooperate with the other Parties in
order to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, or
amendment required for any third party to novate (schuldhernieuwing) any
Transferred Contract or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of
such third party to such arrangements, so that the transfer of such
Transferred Contract will be valid and enforceable against such third party
and, in any case, as between Buyer and such third party, the rights under
such Transferred Contracts (formerly inuring to the benefit of the Sellers)
shall following Closing only inure to the benefit of Buyer and only Buyer will
be responsible for performance of the obligations under such
Transferred Contracts. In the event that any such third party consent cannot
be obtained, _Section 2.12_ shall apply.

(c) Without limiting  _Section 5.2_, each of the Parties will give any
notices to, make any filings with, and use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to obtain any authorizations, consents, and approvals of any Person or
Governmental Authorities in connection with the matters referred to in
_Section 5.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule or as are otherwise necessary and
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but
not limited to, any consents, waivers or approvals required under Export
Control Laws and any applicable employment laws and Collective Bargaining
Agreements.

Section 5.4  _Preservation of Business_. Except as otherwise contemplated
hereby or as required by law, Sellers will, and Sellers will cause the
Acquired Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
Business as presently conducted substantially intact in all material
respects, including maintaining its present operations, physical facilities,
working conditions and material relationships with suppliers and customers,
consistent with Sellers policies and practices.

 

Section 5.5 _Operation of Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or
any Related Agreement will give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Business prior to the Closing. Prior
to the Closing, Sellers will exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Related Agreements, complete control
and supervision over their and their Subsidiaries respective operations with
respect to the Business in compliance with this Agreement and any Related
Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, from the date
hereof until the earlier of the Closing or such date this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article XI_ , no Seller or Acquired Subsidiary shall
take any of the actions required to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule
with respect to  _Section 3.8(a)_ through _(k)_ without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and any action taken with such consent shall not be a
breach of  _Section 3.8_; provided, however, that no consent of Buyer will
be

 



52  required for any retention arrangement entered into in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would be covered by _Sections
3.8(f)_ or _(g)_ above so long as such arrangements do not exceed 20% of any
recipients annual pay.

Section 5.6 _Notice of Developments_. Each of Sellers and Buyer will give
prompt written notice to the other Party of (i) the existence of any fact or
circumstance, or the occurrence of any event, of which it has Knowledge which
would reasonably be likely to constitute a material breach of the
representations and warranties given by the other Party pursuant to _Article
III_ or _IV_ (as applicable) or cause a condition to a Partys obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Article VII_
not to be satisfied as of a reasonably foreseeable Closing Date, or (ii) the
receipt of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
or any securities market or securities regulator in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any such notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ will not
be deemed to amend or supplement this Agreement and the failure to deliver any
such notice will not constitute a waiver of any right or condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by any Party. Without
limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall promptly provide notice to Buyer of the
receipt of any written notice received from any Governmental Authority, or
reports or voluntary disclosures filed with a Governmental Authority (other
than routine filings in the ordinary course of business) with respect to the
matters described in  _Section 3.22_, _Section 3.24_, _Section 3.25_,
_Section 3.26_, _Section 3.27_ and _Section 3.28_, subject to any
applicable legal restrictions against such disclosure.

 

Section 5.7 _Notice of Supplemental Disclosure_. Without limiting the
obligations of Sellers contemplated by  _Section 5.6_, from and after the
date hereof but prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the scheduled Closing
Date, Sellers shall inform Buyer in writing pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ of
any material breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers, and any
additions or deletions to information provided in the Disclosure Schedule
needed to reflect changes occurring between the date hereof and Closing, in
each case of which Sellers have Knowledge (a " _Disclosure Supplement_ ").
Any such Disclosure Supplement will be for information purposes only and will
not affect Buyers right to indemnification for such breach pursuant to
_Article III_ or _Section 8.2(a)_, and such breach shall not affect Buyers
obligation to close the Transactions (except as provided in the following
sentence) and Buyer reserves the right to claim damages in respect of such
breach. If the Disclosure Supplement relates to a breach of the
representations and warranties of Sellers which is sufficiently material to
prevent, after a reasonable period in which to cure such breach, the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, Sellers or
Buyer may terminate this Agreement prior to the Closing and in no event later
than 20 Business Days after receipt by Buyer of such Disclosure Supplement,
unless Sellers have agreed to indemnify Buyer for such breach pursuant to
_Article VIII_ hereto and such breach is reasonably capable of being
indemnifiable, provided that such right to indemnify Buyer shall not apply to
a Material Casualty.

 

Section 5.8 _Access; No Contact; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Sellers will, and will cause the
Acquired Subsidiaries to, permit Buyer and its Representatives to have
reasonable access during normal business hours, in accordance with Sellers
and the Acquired Subsidiaries internal policies and procedures and subject to
applicable laws and regulations, and in a manner so as not to interfere 

 



53  unreasonably with the normal business operations of Sellers and the Acquired
Subsidiaries, to the Acquired Assets and other premises, properties and assets
related to the Business;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, for avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing will not require any Person to waive, or take any action
with the effect of waiving, its attorney-client privilege with respect
thereto. Neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives shall conduct any
sampling at any of the Facilities of environmental media or building
materials. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate regarding transition planning,
including meetings of relevant personnel with respect thereto.

 

(b) During the period from the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date,
Buyer will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, directly contact
any Employees, customers, suppliers or licensors of the Business in connection
with or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Sellers it being understood that the forgoing is without
prejudice to Buyers right to contact the Transferred Employees prior to
Closing in accordance with _Annex H_.

(c) All information obtained pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or this _Section
5.8_ will be Evaluation Material (as such term is defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. No Party will issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the existence or
subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the
other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may make any public
disclosure which it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or
any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party will (a) promptly inform the other Party
thereof prior to making the disclosure to the extent practicable
and permissible under applicable law so that the other Party may seek an
appropriate protective order, and (b) in any event limit the content of such
disclosure to such information as is required to be disclosed under applicable
law of listing or trading agreement); and _provided_ _further_ that each of
the Parties may make internal announcements to their respective employees and
may make public disclosure required by applicable law or any listing or
trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities that are not
inconsistent in any material respects with the Parties prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.10 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Parties hereby waive compliance with
the provisions of any bulk transfer laws or similar laws of any jurisdiction
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the United Nations Convention on the Sale of Goods, and hereby waive all
claims related to the non-compliance therewith subject to
Sellers indemnification obligations in _Section 8.2_.

Section 5.11 _DDTC Advance Notification_. Sellers or one or more of
the Acquired Subsidiaries are registered with the DDTC in accordance with the
ITAR. The ITAR may require a registrant to notify the Department of State in
advance of any intended sale or transfer of ownership or control and, in the
case of any intended sale or transfer of ownership or control to a foreign
person, as defined by the ITAR, such notification is required and must be
filed at least 60 days in advance of the Closing. Each Party will notify the
DDTC of the proposed transactions in accordance with the ITAR.

 



54 Section 5.12 _Security Clearance Notifications_. Sellers or the applicable
Acquired Subsidiary shall make all required notifications to the Defense
Security Service in accordance with 2-302(b) of the National Industrial
Security Operations Manual and comply with the notification requirements of
all other Governmental Authorities with an interest in Sellers industrial
security measures.

Section 5.13 _Replacement Bonding Requirements_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer and Sellers will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to terminate
or otherwise provide replacement guarantees, standby letters of credit or
other assurances of payment with respect to all Bonding Requirements, in form
and substance satisfactory to Sellers, acting reasonably, and any banks or
other counterparties thereto, and, both prior to and following the Closing
Date, Buyer and Sellers will cooperate to obtain a release in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers with respect to all
Bonding Requirements. To the extent Buyer is unable to make such arrangements
to terminate or otherwise replace any Bonding Requirements prior to the
Closing (the " _Remaining Guaranties_ "), Buyer will indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Guarantors from and against all Damages incurred by any
such Person as a result of such failure and from and against any continuing
obligations and liabilities arising after the Closing under any such
Remaining Guaranties. Moreover, Sellers and Buyer will continue to cooperate
and use their respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to terminate or cause
Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the
Seller Guarantors in respect of all obligations of the Seller Guarantors under
any such Remaining Guaranties. To the extent that any Seller Guarantor has
performance obligations under any such Remaining Guaranties, Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to perform, or cause its affiliates to perform, such
obligations on behalf of such Seller Guarantor or otherwise take such action
as reasonably requested by Sellers so as to put such Seller Guarantor in the
same position as if Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and not such Seller
Guarantor, had performed or were performing such obligations.

Section 5.14 _Trading in Barco NV Stock/Buyer Stock_. Buyer will not, and
will cause each of its Affiliates, directors, officers or employees involved
in the transactions contemplated herein, to not, buy or sell the publicly-
traded securities of Barco NV until the 3rd Business Day following the

directors, officers or employees involved in the transactions contemplated
herein, to not, buy or sell the publicly-traded securities of Buyer until the
3rd Business Day following the Closing Date.

Section 5.15 _Employee Matters_. Buyer and Sellers agree to be bound by

Agreement is terminated, the Sellers will, and will cause each of their
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Subsidiaries) to immediately terminate
any discussions, inquiries, responses or negotiations in respect of any such
inquiry. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Sale Transaction" means any
offer or proposal (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
concerning any (i) merger, consolidation, sale of stock, sale of assets or
other business combination transaction involving the Business or the Acquired
Subsidiaries, (ii) sale or other disposition of, or the granting of any rights
or purchase options with respect to, assets of the Business or the Acquired
Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of business, and (iii) issuance, sale,
or other disposition of securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) of the Acquired Subsidiaries.

Section 5.19 _Insurance_. Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to file claims under their insurance
policies with respect to any insured damages to the Acquired Assets occurring
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such claims.

ARTICLE VI

OTHER COVENANTS

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period from and after the
Closing:

 

Section 6.1 _Cooperation_. The Parties will cooperate with each other, and
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to cooperate with each other, to provide an orderly transition
of the Business from Sellers to Buyer and to minimize the disruption to the
Business and Sellers and their Subsidiaries other businesses resulting from
the transactions contemplated hereby as requested by any Party and at the
requesting Partys sole cost and expense (and without liability of any kind to
the other Party cooperating with such request in providing such
requested actions other than arising from the cooperating Partys gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith in connection therewith).

 

Section 6.2 _Further Assurances; Inadvertent Transfers of Assets_.

 

(a) In case at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each Party will take
such further action (including the execution and delivery to any other Party
of such other reasonable instruments of sale, transfer,

 



56  conveyance, assignment, assumption and confirmation, providing materials and
information) as another Party may reasonably request as will be reasonably
deemed necessary to transfer, convey and assign to Buyer all of the Acquired
Equity and the Acquired Assets and to confirm Buyers assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.2(a)_, to the extent that
either Buyer or Sellers discovers any additional assets or properties which
Buyer and Sellers mutually agree should have been transferred or assigned to
Buyer as Acquired Assets but were not so transferred or assigned, Buyer and
Sellers will cooperate and execute and deliver any instruments of transfer or
assignment reasonably necessary to transfer and assign such asset or property
to Buyer, it being understood that no additional consideration will be owing
by Buyer in respect of the transfer of any such additional assets or
properties. Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.2(a)_, to the
extent that either Buyer or Sellers discover any assets or properties which
is an Excluded Asset which Buyer and Sellers mutually agree was inadvertently
or otherwise mistakenly transferred or assigned to Buyer, Buyer and Sellers
will cooperate and execute and deliver any instruments of transfer or
assignment reasonably necessary to transfer and assign such asset or property
back to the applicable Seller.

 

Section 6.3 _Run-Off_.

 

(a) _Referrals_. From and after the Closing Date and until the first
anniversary of the date thereof, Sellers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to refer all customer or supplier inquiries received by Sellers
relating to the Business to a point of contact designated by Buyer.

 

(b) _Removal of Seller Marks_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to remove, replace, obliterate or
otherwise obscure any and all Seller Marks from all Acquired Assets and cease
use of such Seller Marks as promptly as commercially practicable after the

date thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date,
Buyer will not use existing marketing and sales material bearing any Seller
Marks unless appropriately stickered by Buyer to reflect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Sellers.

(c) _Affiliation_. Buyer will, and will cause each of its Affiliates to,
cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with any Seller or any of
its respective Affiliates, save for any affiliation through this Agreement or
any of the Related Agreements, and as described on _Annex I_.

 

(d) _Name Change_. Within five Business Days following Closing, Buyer will
make all such filings as necessary to change the corporate names of the
Acquired Subsidiaries to a name that does not include "Barco".

Section 6.4 _Access; Enforcement; Record Retention_. From and after the
Closing, upon request by any Party, each other Party will (a) permit the
requesting Party and its Representatives to have reasonable access during
normal business hours, and in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably
with the normal business operations of the other Party, to all premises,
properties, personnel, Records and Contracts of or related to the Business,
the

 



57  Acquired Equity, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and (b)
provide the other Party with copies of any documentation or records (including
in the case of a request from the Buyer, any Excluded Records to the extent
relating to the Business) reasonably requested by the other Party within a
reasonable period of time of the request; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing will not require any Person to take any
such action if it (x) may result in a waiver or breach of any attorney/client
privilege, (y) could reasonably be expected to result in violation of
applicable law, or (z) providing such access or information would be
reasonably expected to be unreasonably disruptive to its operations. Without
limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, such reasonable
access may be for the purposes of (a) preparing Tax Returns, (b) monitoring
or enforcing rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement or any of
the Related Agreements, or (c) complying with the requirements of any
Governmental Authority. Each Party agrees to maintain the files or
records which are contemplated by the first sentence of this _Section 6.4_
in a manner consistent in all material respects with its document retention
and destruction policies, as in effect from time to time, for six years
following the Closing or such longer period as may be required by applicable
law.

Section 6.5 _Non-Competition_. For a period of three years following the
Closing, Sellers will not, and will ensure that none of their Subsidiaries
will, directly or indirectly (including as a stockholder, consultant, member
or partner), engage in the Business as conducted immediately prior to the
Closing in those countries in which the Business has active operations or
sales as of the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that for avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing will not restrict Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries from in
any way conducting any other business or operation of any such Person as of
the date hereof (any such business or operation, including any extensions
thereof that are not in the Business, an " _Existing Grandfathered Business_
") or conducting any business or operation arising from the Supply
Agreements; and _provided_ _further_ that, for such purposes, (x) no owner of
less than five percent of the outstanding equity or voting interests of any
Person and (y) no director (or other equivalent position on an equivalent
governing body) of any Person, and (z) without limiting clause ( _x_ ) hereof,
no pension plan, savings plan or other similar employee benefit plan owning
any equity or other interests in a Person for passive investment purposes
only, in any such case will be deemed to be engaged in the business of such
Person solely as a result of ownership of such equity or voting interests or
such directorship.

 

Section 6.6 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. With the exception of general job
advertisements directed to the public or unless agreed otherwise by Buyer and
Sellers, i.e. with the approval of the VP HR of Buyer and Sellers, Buyer and
its Affiliates on the one hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates on the other
hand hereby undertake, for a period for at least 24 months after the Closing
Date, not to solicit, nor hire, either directly or indirectly, any manager or
employee of the other Parties (whether acting as an employee or as an
independent), or induce those managers or employees to leave any position they
occupy now or in the future with other Parties. In case of violation of this
_Section 6.6_, the violating Party will pay to the other Party the cost
amount equal to one annual net salary of the manger or employee concerned.
However, the foregoing provision will not prevent a Party and its Affiliates
from (i) soliciting any such employee by a public advertisement placed by it
or by a search firm retained by it (provided that the search firm was not
instructed or encouraged to target or focus on such employees) or hiring any
employee responding thereto, (ii) soliciting or hiring any employee whose
employment has been terminated for at least three months, or (iii) hiring any
employee making an employment inquiry to such Party or any of their
Affiliates at any time at least 12 months following the Closing.

 



58 Section 6.7 _Post-Closing Payments_.

 

(a) Any payment made to Sellers or their Affiliates after Closing in respect
of amounts owed to Buyer under any Transferred Contracts or related to any
Acquired Asset shall be received by Sellers or their Affiliates as agent and
trustee for Buyer and shall be paid by the relevant Seller (or the relevant
Sellers Affiliate at Sellers direction) to Buyer promptly after receipt.

(b) Any payment made to Buyer or its Affiliates after Closing in respect of
amounts owed to Sellers under any Transferred Contracts or related to any
Excluded Asset shall be received by Buyer or its Affiliates as agent and
trustee for Sellers and shall be paid by Buyer (or its Affiliate at Buyers
direction) to Sellers promptly after receipt.

 

Section 6.8 _Recording of Intellectual Property Assignments_. All of the
Intellectual Property Assignments will be recorded and filed by Buyer and
Sellers, at Buyers sole cost and expense, with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities as promptly as practicable following the Closing.

 

Section 6.9 _Transfer Taxes and VAT_.

 

(a) Buyer will pay any stamp, documentary, registration, use, transfer, added-
value or other non-income Tax, if any (a " _Transfer Tax_ "), imposed under
applicable law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Sellers and Buyer will cooperate to prepare and timely file any Tax Returns
required to be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes described in
the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.9(c)_, the Parties agree that the consideration
given in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby is exclusive of any
VAT which may be chargeable in respect of such transfer and to the extent that
VAT is so chargeable then Buyer (which in this _Section 6.9_ shall include
any relevant Affiliate of Buyer) shall pay upon production of a valid VAT
invoice in relation to the relevant allocation of the Purchase Price the
amount properly chargeable in respect thereof under this Agreement.

 

(c) The Parties agree that, to the extent permitted by law, they will use
reasonable endeavors (including providing any necessary confirmations in the
Belgian DAT Business Transfer Agreement) in order that the transfer of the
Belgian DAT Business is treated as being outside the scope of VAT for the
purposes of Article 19 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC and any

Section 6.15 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. Sellers shall indemnify Buyer from and against all
Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of any Acquired Subsidiary for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end
of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (each a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), provided, however,

does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of
any property or similar ad valorem Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and the amount of any other
Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(c) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to

accordance with the past practices of the Acquired Subsidiaries. 

(d) _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or
any Acquired Subsidiary, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer
or any Acquired Subsidiary becomes entitled, that relate to Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (other than any such
refunds and/or credits which have been shown as assets on 

 



61  the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement), shall be for the account of
Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of
such credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. In addition,
to the extent that a claim for refund or a proceeding results in a payment or
credit against Income Tax by a Government Authority to Buyer or any Acquired
Subsidiary of any amount accrued for such item on the Conclusive Net Working
Capital Statement, Buyer shall credit such amount against any payment then due
from Sellers under _Section 6.15(a)_. To the extent there is any excess
credit under this _Section 6.15(d)_, such amount shall be set off against
any payment(s) already made or subsequently due under _Section 6.15(a)_ in
chronological order until exhausted, provided that to the extent that such
amount is set off against any payment already made by Sellers (and
not previously refunded under this _Section 6.15(d)_), it will be repaid to
Sellers. The amount of any Tax refund or credit to which this _Section
6.15(d)_ applies shall be net of any Tax arising as a result of the receipt of
such refund or credit.

(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties hereto, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall

of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Buyer agrees (i) to the extent required by law,
to procure that each Acquired Subsidiary retains all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to such Acquired Subsidiary relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any relevant Government
Authority, and (ii) to give Sellers reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books or records. Buyer and
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Government Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

(f) _Effect of Certain Actions by Buyer_. Buyer agrees that Sellers shall not
be liable under _Section 6.15(a)_ in respect of any Tax to the extent that
such Tax arises as a result of any voluntary act of the Buyer or any Acquired
Subsidiary after the Closing (including the making of any Tax election or
amendment of any Tax Return previously submitted). In addition, Buyer shall
indemnify Sellers from and against all Damages, including any increased Tax
liability or any reduction of any deduction, credit or loss carryover,
incurred by Sellers or an Affiliate of Sellers as a result of any such act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall remain liable (and the foregoing
indemnification shall not apply) where such act of the Buyer or Acquired
Subsidiary was (i) required by any legislation, regulation or other statutory
requirement, whether coming into force before, on or after Closing; (ii)
pursuant to a legally binding obligation entered into by the relevant Acquired
Subsidiary on or before Closing; (iii) carried out at the direction of

or administrative, judicial or other proceedings (each a " _Tax Controversy_
") related to any Tax Return or Taxes of the Acquired Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and with respect to which
Sellers could have any indemnification obligation hereunder, and shall have
the right to employ counsel and other advisors of their choice and expense.
Buyer shall have the right to control, at its expense, all other Tax
Controversies that relate to Taxes or Tax Returns with respect to the
Acquired Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period and which could give rise to any
indemnification obligation hereunder, and shall have the right to employ
counsel and other advisors of its choice at its expense and to control the
conduct of such Tax Controversy; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case,
(i) the controlling Party shall notify the other of any such Tax Controversy,

65 Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification; Calculation of Damages_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Article VIII_ :

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party nor Seller Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") will be entitled to recover from Sellers or Buyer,
respectively (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), for any claim for indemnity in
respect of Damages arising under _Section 8.2(a)_ or  _Section 8.3(a)_,
respectively, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, the total of
all such claims against Sellers or Buyer, respectively, in respect of such
Damages exceeds one million (the " _Basket_ "), and in such event only to
the amount of such excess;

(b) No Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party will be entitled
to recover from Sellers or Buyer, respectively, or include for purposes of
determining if Damages have met or exceeded the Basket, any claim for
indemnity in respect of any individual Damage arising under _Section 8.2(a)_
or  _Section 8.3(a)_, respectively, unless and until the claim against
Sellers or Buyer, respectively, in respect of such Damages exceeds 100,000.
For the purposes of this _Section 8.4(b)_, a series of claims for
indemnity relating to the same or a connected event, fact, circumstance, act
or omission shall be accumulated and shall be treated as a single claim for
the purpose of assessing whether or not the claims together exceed the
specified threshold of Damages. 

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties will not
be entitled to recover from Sellers or Buyer, respectively, Damages arising
under _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_, respectively, greater than 45
million in the aggregate.

 

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties will not
be entitled to recover from Sellers or Buyer, respectively, Damages that are

type of multiple of any Indemnified Party.

(e) The Buyer Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to recover from Sellers
Damages reflected as a Liability on the Conclusive Net Working Capital

incurred by the Indemnified Party for the year in which the indemnification
payments are accrued with respect to such Damages hereunder, and shall be
computed net of any (x) actual Tax savings realized by the Indemnified Party
for the year in which the Damages are incurred and (y) insurance proceeds and
recoveries in respect of third party indemnification obligations actually
received by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Damages, net of out
of pocket expenses reasonably incurred. Each Indemnified Party agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain recovery in respect of any
Damages from any insurance or third party indemnity which is available in
respect of Damages. If an Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds
or indemnification recoveries in connection with Damages for which it has been
indemnified hereunder, the Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying
Party and refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance
proceeds or indemnification recoveries when received, less its reasonable
costs of recovery up to the amount for which indemnification was paid
hereunder.

 



66 (g) Subject to _Section 8.4(a)_, each Indemnified Party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages in respect of which a
claim could be made under this _Article VIII_.

be entitled to recover from Sellers or Buyer, respectively, Damages arising
under _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_, respectively, that arise from

prior to the Closing, unless the claim for indemnity therefor has been
delivered by the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, or (B) in the case
of a covenant to be performed following the Closing, unless the claim for
indemnity therefor has been delivered by the six month anniversary of the date
on which a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party,
respectively, has become aware (or reasonably should have become aware if it
had duly inquired or due to the prudent conduct of its business) of the breach
thereof (excluding any instances in which third party advisors or other third
parties or Indemnified Parties who are no longer employed by or affiliated
with the relevant Party at such time become aware thereof).

(i) No Buyer Indemnified Party may seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ with respect to any Damages of any Buyer Indemnified Party who
is or was an officer or director of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries
resulting from any right of contribution, indemnification or other
similar right against Sellers or such Subsidiary that such Buyer Indemnified
Party may have by virtue of his or her status as an officer or director of
Sellers or such Subsidiary, whether arising from any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement or otherwise. Buyer, on behalf of each Buyer Indemnified
Party, agrees that no Buyer Indemnified Party will make any such claim for
contribution or indemnification or make a claim for recovery against any
directors and officers liability insurance policy of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates with respect to matters covered by the foregoing matters.

 

(j) In no event shall any Party be entitled to duplicate compensation with
respect to any Damages for any breach of representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation or agreement in connection with this Agreement, even though such
Damages or breach may be addressed by more than one provision of this
Agreement.

 

(k) None of the limitations contained in this _Section 8.4_ shall apply to,
and the Buyer shall be entitled to full and unconditional indemnification for
any Damages resulting from, any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or agreement in connection with this Agreement or any
Related Agreement that is the consequence of fraud ("bedrog") by Sellers.

(l) For the purposes of _Section 8.4(g)_ the Indemnified Party shall not be
obliged to take any action or omit from taking any action which it in good
faith believes may materially adversely affect the goodwill of the Business or
the Indemnifying Partys wider business.

 

Section 8.5 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 



67 (a) If any third party will notify any Indemnified Party of any third party
claim, demand, assessment or the commencement of any Litigation (each, a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnified Party will promptly (and in
any event within 10 Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party
Claim or the commencement of Litigation with respect thereto) notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing stating that the Third Party Claim may
give rise to a claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party and
specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount,
both to the extent known, of the claim asserted; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying
Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless
(and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is materially
prejudiced.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense against
any Third Party Claim by providing written notice (i) within 30 days after
receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, or (ii) at any time if the
Indemnified Party is not conducting the defense of a Third Party Claim in a
reasonably diligent manner, which the Indemnifying Party may conduct with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
which the Indemnifying Party may control so long as the Indemnifying Party
conducts such defense in a reasonably diligent manner.

 

(c) From and after the date that the Indemnifying Party has assumed and is
conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with  _Section
8.5(b)_, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense and participate in, but not control, the defense of the Third
Party Claim; (ii) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
cooperate fully with each other and their respective counsel in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim,
including providing access to any relevant books and records, properties,
employees and Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing will not require any Party to waive, or take any
action which has the effect of waiving, its attorney-client privilege with
respect thereto; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by
the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable
relief upon the Indemnified Party.

 

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of
the Third Party Claim after notice thereof, (i) the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate; (ii) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party
promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) to the extent such
costs are Damages for which the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to
indemnification hereunder; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible for any costs the Indemnified Party may incur resulting
from the Third Party Claim to the extent such costs are Damages for which the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder; and ; and
(iv) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



68 (e) In conducting the defense of a Third Party Claim and negotiating any
settlement in respect thereof, the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, shall keep the other Party reasonably informed of
all material developments and consult with the other Party in good faith
regarding the potential impact on such other Partys business and
relationship with Governmental Authorities, customers, and other third
parties, and alternatives to resolve such Third Party Claim taking into
consideration the interests of both the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this _Section 9.5_ to the contrary, any
Third Party Claim relating to Taxes or Tax Returns shall be governed by the
provisions of _Section 6.15_.

Section 8.6 _Claims and Payment; Treatment of Payments_. On each occasion
that any Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ , the Indemnifying Party will, at each such time, promptly pay
the amount of such indemnification following the receipt of notice of a claim
therefor. All notices of claims for indemnification hereunder by any
Indemnified Party will be made with reasonable particularity and will state
the amount of Damages sought thereunder to the extent reasonably practicable
to provide such estimate. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement will be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

 

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, other than in the
event of fraud, and without prejudice to  _Section 8.4(l)_ and _Section
10.9_, the remedies set forth in this _Article VIII_ will be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for Damages relating to the
subject matter hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer and Sellers hereby waive to the extent permitted under applicable law,
any statutory, equitable or common law rights or remedies relating to any
environmental, health or safety matters relating to the subject matter
hereof, including any such matters arising under any Environmental, Health or
Safety Requirements and those arising under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act or under any other applicable law in
the various relevant jurisdictions.

itself), have been satisfied or waived as of the Initial Outside Date; or

 

(ii) as and to the extent Buyer has a right of termination pursuant to
_Section 5.7_;

 

(c) Sellers may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer:

 

(i) if the Closing will not have occurred prior to the Initial Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ will not be available to Sellers if their failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement (including such Parties
obligations set forth in _Section 5.1_) has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before the Initial
Outside Date; and _provided further_ , that the date at which Sellers may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ will be
automatically extended to the Extended Outside Date if all of the conditions
to the obligations of Sellers and Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Article VII_ other than those set forth in
_Section 7.1(c)_, _Section 7.1(d)_, _Section 7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.2(d)_
(and other than those conditions that are then capable of being satisfied at
the Closing itself), have been satisfied or waived as of the Initial Outside
Date; or

(ii) if any event, circumstance, condition, fact or effect has occurred or
exists which (A) would result in a failure of a condition to Sellers
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in
_Section 7.2_ (unless the failure results primarily from Sellers themselves
breaching any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this
Agreement), and (B) cannot reasonably be cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will have given Buyer written
notice thereof, delivered at least 10 Business Days prior to such termination
stating its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(c)(ii)_ and the basis for such termination with reasonable particularity
and provided the opportunity to cure any breach giving rise to the effects
set forth in clauses ( _A_ ) and ( _B_ ) above during such time.

 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, all
rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder will terminate upon such
termination and will become null and void (except that _Article I_
(Definitions), _Section 3.30_ (Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties), _Section 5.8(c)_ (Access; No Contact; Confidentiality),
_Section 6.11_ (Acknowledgements), _Article X_ (Miscellaneous) and this
_Section 9.2_ (Effect of Termination)

 



70  will survive any such termination) and no Party will have any Liability to
the other Party hereunder; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section
9.2_ will relieve any Party from Liability for any breach occurring prior to
any such termination of any of the representations and warranties or covenants
set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated for the failure to satisfy the condition
to Buyers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set
forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the condition to Sellers obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section
7.2(c)_, and such failure has not resulted from Sellers or Buyers breach,
respectively, hereof (in which event _Section 9.2(a)_ above shall apply),
then Buyer will pay Sellers the Termination Fee in Cash. In the event that
Sellers will receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section
9.2(b)_, Sellers agree that the receipt of such payment will be deemed to be
liquidated damages for and will constitute full payment to and the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) of Sellers and will be considered as an irrevocable settlement
("dading") in the meaning of Article 2044 et seq. of the Belgian Civil Code
that is full and final ("voor slot van alle rekeningen") between the
Parties with respect to any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Sellers in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and Sellers will not be entitled to bring or maintain any claim,
action or proceeding against Buyer arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

Agreement will be construed as an implied amendment or agreement to amend or

Related Agreements by such Nominated Buyer(s) as constituting performance
of such obligations on behalf of Buyer; (c) such designation shall not
remove, limit or otherwise effect Buyers Liability towards Sellers in the
event that Buyers obligations under this Agreement are not duly performed,
such obligations continuing in full force and effect as principal obligations
of Buyer; and (d) such Nominated Buyer shall be entitled to enforce all
Buyers rights and exercise all Buyers discretions under this Agreement and

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Parties notice in the manner set forth in this _Section 10.6_.

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the Kingdom of Belgium, without giving effect to its principles or rules of
conflict of laws, to the extent such principles or rules would permit or
require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 10.8 _Disputes_.

 

(a) If there shall be any dispute, controversy or claim (" _Dispute_ ")
between the Parties arising out of, relating to, or connected with this
Agreement, the breach, termination or invalidity hereof, or the provisions
contained herein or omitted herefrom, other than a Dispute under _Section
2.10_, the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the matter on an
amicable basis and

 



73  in a manner fair and equitable to the Parties. If one Party notifies another
Party that a Dispute has arisen and the Parties are unable to resolve the
Dispute within 30 days from such notice, then, unless the Parties agree to
extend this period of time, the matter shall be referred to the Chief
Financial Officer of the Parties (as applicable), who shall act by mutual
agreement on all such matters. No recourse to arbitration under
this Agreement shall take place unless and until the Chief Financial Officer
of the Parties (as applicable) have been unable to resolve the Dispute within
30 days after the expiration of the 30-day period referred to above or any
extension thereof.

 

(b) The Parties irrevocably agree that any Disputes, other than a Dispute
under _Section 2.10_, that are not resolved in accordance with paragraph (a)
within the two abovementioned 30 day periods or extensions thereof shall be
finally settled by means of arbitration in Brussels, Belgium, by three
arbitrators appointed and proceeding in accordance with the Rules
of Arbitration (the " _CEPANI Rules_ ") of the Belgian Center for Mediation
and Arbitration (" _CEPANI_ ") as the exclusive means of resolving such
Disputes. For purposes of appointing such arbitrators, each of the Sellers
and the Buyer shall appoint one arbitrator and either the third arbitrator
shall be selected by the two Party-appointed arbitrators or, failing agreement
within 30 days after the Party-appointed arbitrators have been confirmed, by
CEPANI in accordance with the CEPANI Rules. All submissions and awards in
relation to arbitration under this Agreement shall be made in English and all
arbitration proceedings and all pleadings shall be in English.

 

(c) Except as may be required by applicable law, stock exchange rules,
Governmental Authority, or in connection with the ordinary course
of business, the Parties agree to maintain confidentiality as to all aspects
of the arbitration, including its existence and results, except that nothing
herein shall prevent any Party from disclosing information regarding the
arbitration for purposes of enforcing the award of the arbitral tribunal or
in any court proceedings involving the Parties. The Parties further agree to
obtain the arbitral tribunals agreement to preserve the confidentiality of
the arbitration.

 

(d) In the event of a Dispute, other than a Dispute under _Section 2.10_,
each Party shall be entitled to an interim injunction, restraining order or
such other equitable relief as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem
necessary or appropriate to restrain the other Party. These injunctive
remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies that
the aggrieved Party may have in law or in equity.

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, (a) Buyer will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Sellers and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity and (b)
Sellers will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement by Buyer or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement to prevent breaches of, or enforce compliance with, those
covenants of Buyer that require Buyer to (i) use its reasonable best efforts
to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2_, and (ii)
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The courts of
Brussels shall have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of any 

 



74  such action for injunction. The Parties further agree that (x) by seeking
the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.9_, a Party will not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to such Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in
the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.9_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this
_Section 10.9_ will require any Party hereto to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 10.9_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _Article IX_ (and/or receipt of any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 9.2_), nor will the commencement of any legal action or
legal proceeding pursuant to this  _Section 10.9_ or anything set forth in
this _Section 10.9_ restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article IX_ , or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 10.10 _Severability_. Subject to _Section 2.13_, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement. In the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement will be held by a court or
other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, such provisions will be either limited or eliminated only to
the minimum extent necessary or be replaced by a valid replacement provision
having a similar economic effect which is as close as possible to that of the
invalid, void or unenforceable provision.

Section 10.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement will not confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties, and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.12 _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 10.13 _Disclosure Schedule_. All capitalized terms not defined in
the Disclosure Schedule will have the meanings ascribed to them in this
Agreement. The representations and warranties of Sellers in this Agreement are
made and given, and the covenants are agreed to, subject to the disclosures
and exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule. The disclosure of any
matter in any section of the Disclosure Schedule will, subject to the terms of
this Agreement, be deemed to be a disclosure against the representations and
warranties in Article III (and for all other purposes of this Agreement where
matters are specifically required to be scheduled in the Disclosure Schedule
by the terms of this Agreement) and all other sections of the Disclosure
Schedule to which such matter relates to the extent readily apparent on the
face thereof. The listing of any matter will expressly not be deemed to
constitute an admission by any Seller, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material, is required to be disclosed under this Agreement or falls
within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract or law will be construed as an admission
or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. In no event will the listing of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of Sellers
representations, 

 



75  warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement. All attachments to
the Disclosure Schedule are incorporated by reference into the Disclosure
Schedule in which they are directly or indirectly referenced. The Disclosure
Schedule includes references to or brief descriptions of certain agreements
and instruments in the Data Rooms, which are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the text of such agreements and instruments. The information
contained in the Disclosure Schedule is in all events provided subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement. Any Disclosure Supplement shall be for information
purposes only and nothing in this _Section 10.13_ shall have the effect of
removing Buyers rights to indemnification in respect of any matter referred
to in any Disclosure Supplement delivered pursuant to _Section 5.7_.

 

Section 10.14 _Headings; Table of Contents_. The section headings and the
table of contents contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule are
inserted for convenience only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.15 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be
deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered by
facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by
portable document format (.pdf), thus made in four originals, of which each
Seller and Buyer acknowledges the receipt of one.
