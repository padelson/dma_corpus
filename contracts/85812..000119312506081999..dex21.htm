iii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 17, 2006 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), F Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), and Russell Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ")
has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the State of Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
"), and deem it advisable and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, that Merger Sub merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), with the Company to survive the Merger and to become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Parent and Merger Sub have taken all necessary corporate action to
approve the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection
with the Merger as set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree, and intend to be legally bound, as
follows: 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at or be directed from the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, on the first business day after the conditions to the parties
obligation to effect the Merger contained in _Article V_ have been satisfied
or waived (the " _Closing Date_ "), unless another date or place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.



 

\- 1 - Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by causing a certificate of merger with respect to
the Merger to be executed, filed and recorded in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective at the time of the filing with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware of such certificate of merger in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL or at such later time as shall be specified in
the certificate of merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. Subject to  _Section
4.6(b)_ hereof, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub as
in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, provided that Article First of
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read in its entirety as follows: "FIRST" The name of the
Corporation is Russell Corporation."

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from
the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in the manner
provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law.

Section 1.7 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the
holders of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (referred to herein as either the " _Shares_ " or "
_Company Common Stock_ ") or the common stock of the Parent:

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary (as
defined below) of Parent, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company as treasury stock, shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore. 



 

\- 2 - (c) _Exchange of Shares_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.7(b)_
hereof and any Dissenting Shares (if applicable and as defined in _Section
1.9_ hereof)), shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive $18.00 in cash without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such share of Company Common Stock in the
manner provided in  _Section 1.8_ hereof. All such shares of Company Common
Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with _Section 1.8_ hereof, without interest.

(d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each
case, normal quarterly cash dividends), the Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 1.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") to receive and make the payments of the funds to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to
_Section 1.7(c)_ hereof. When and as needed, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Paying Agent such funds in trust for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with
_Section 1.7 hereof_, for timely payment hereunder. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, with any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments payable to Parent; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall reduce the amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article I_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
"), whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 1.7_ hereof into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
 



 

\- 3 -  use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (subject to subsection (e) below) for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
1.8_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this _Section 1.8_.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_. 

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following one year after
the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been deposited with the Paying Agent
and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may
be payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger such amounts
as Parent,  



 

\- 4 -  the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code (as defined
below) or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made.

Section 1.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, holders of Shares who have properly exercised, perfected and
not subsequently withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights with respect thereto
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not have any of such Shares converted into or become exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by such Section 262,
including the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares
in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such
holders fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right, each of such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
it had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest
thereon, as provided in _Section 1.7(c)_ hereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _Section 1.9_, if this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL relating to rights of appraisal which are received by the Company, and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

Section 1.10  _Company Option Plans; Equity Based Awards_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all options to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any
plan, arrangement or agreement that provide for the grant of Company Stock
Options (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") shall be cancelled by the
Company and shall no longer be outstanding thereafter. In consideration for
such cancellation, the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a cash payment from the Company in
respect of such cancellation in an amount (if any) equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option (whether or not vested at the time of such cancellation) and (y) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, reduced by any
income or employment Tax required to be withheld with respect to such payment.



 

\- 5 - (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock units or other phantom equity based awards (the " _Equity
Based Awards_ ") granted under any plan, arrangement or agreement that
provides for the grant of Equity Based Awards (the " _Company Phantom Equity
Plans_ ", and together with the Company Stock Option Plans, the " _Company
Equity Plans_ "), shall be cancelled by the Company and shall no longer be
outstanding thereafter. In consideration for such cancellation, the holder
thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a cash payment from the Company in respect of such
cancellation in an amount (if any) equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Equity Based Awards (whether
or not vested at the time of such cancellation) and (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price or strike price (or
equivalent thereof, as applicable) per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Equity Based Awards, reduced by any income or employment tax required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. This _Section 1.10(b)_ shall not
apply to Cash-Based Awards (each a " _Cash-Based Award_ "), Performance
Shares (each a " _Performance Share_ ") or Performance Units (each a "
_Performance Unit_ ") under the Executive Incentive Plan, the treatment of
which is governed by  _Section 4.3(d)_.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable efforts to establish a procedure to effect the
surrender of the Company Stock Options and Equity Based Awards contemplated by
this _Section 1.10_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof), will adopt appropriate resolutions
and take such other actions necessary or appropriate to provide that (i) the
Company Equity Plans and all awards issued thereunder (including, without
limitation, the Company Stock Options and Equity Based Awards) will terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the provisions in any other
plan, program, arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant of
any other interest in respect of the equity of the Company shall be of no
further force or effect and shall terminate as of immediately prior to the

relevance is reasonably apparent on its face) (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

Section 2.1 _Organization of the Company and its Subsidiaries_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For
the purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means
an effect which is materially adverse to the financial condition, business or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
but shall exclude any effect resulting from or arising out of (A) seasonal
fluctuations in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) any acts

qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned
or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. For the purposes of this
Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any party, any corporation,
partnership or other Entity or organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party
is a general partner (excluding such partnerships where such party or any

such partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to

executive or regulatory authority or agency (a " _Governmental Entity_ "),
except for the filings or approvals which are not required prior to the
consummation of the Merger or where the failure to take such action or make
such filing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in _Section 2.4(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) violate any provision of the
certificates of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or

Adverse Effect.



 

\- 9 - Section 2.5 _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_. Since January 1, 2004, the
Company has filed or furnished all reports required to be filed or furnished
by it with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") pursuant to the Exchange Act and the Securities Act (as such documents have
been amended since the date of their filing, collectively, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). The Company SEC Documents, as of their respective filing dates,
or if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, did not, to the
Knowledge of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the
Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and other adjustments
described therein, including in the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

Section 2.6 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "). The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2005, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective and the Companys independent registered accountant
has issued an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.
Except as disclosed in _Section 2.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company is unaware of any "significant deficiencies," as defined by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, in the structure or application of its
internal control over financial reporting.

obligations (a) incurred in the ordinary course of business since December
31, 2005, (b) disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, or (c) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, since
December 31, 2005, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any material liabilities or obligations that would be required to be
reflected or reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP, other
than those which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 2.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as (a) disclosed in _Section
2.8_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or (b) required or permitted by this
Agreement, since December 31, 2005 and through the date hereof, (i) there has
not occurred any change, effect, event or occurrence that would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (ii)
the Company has not (a) amended its certificate of incorporation or by-laws;
(b) split, combined or reclassified the Company Common Stock or any capital
stock of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (c) declared or set aside or
paid any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company
Common Stock; or (d) materially changed the Companys accounting methods,
except as required by GAAP or applicable law.

Section 2.9  _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

(a) _Section 2.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
of all material employee benefit plans, (including but not limited to plans
described in section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), maintained by the Company or by any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), which
together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of section 4001(b)(15) of ERISA (" _Benefit Plans_ ") and all
material employment and severance agreements with employees of the Company ("
_Employee Agreements_ "). True and complete copies of all Employee Agreements,
including all amendments to date, have been made available to Parent by the
Company. 

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan: (i) if intended to qualify under
section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), such plan has
received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that
it so qualifies and that its trust is exempt from taxation under section
501(a) of the Code and nothing has occurred to the Knowledge of the Company
since the date of such determination that could materially adversely affect
such qualification or exempt status; (ii) such plan has been administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law; (iii)
no breaches of fiduciary duty have occurred which might reasonably be expected
to give rise to material liability on the part of the Company; (iv) no
disputes are pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that
give rise to or might reasonably be expected to give rise to material
liability on the part of the Company; and  



 

\- 11 -  (v) no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA)
has occurred that give rise to or might reasonably be expected to give
rise to material liability on the part of the Company.

(c) No Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in section
3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Benefit Plan a plan described in section 4063(a) of
ERISA.

(d) Each of the Benefit Plans that is subject to section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA or section 412 of the Code is hereinafter referred to in this _Section
2.9_ as a (" _Title IV Plan_ "). No liability under Title IV or section 302 of
ERISA has been incurred by the Company or by any ERISA Affiliate that
together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and
no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums
due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") (which premiums have
been paid when due). Insofar as the representation made in this _Section
2.9(d)_ applies to sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is
made with respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions during the 5-year
period ending on the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the
Closing Date. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title
IV Plan and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that
presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. No Title IV
Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and
section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Closing Date.
In connection with the freezing of the Companys defined benefit plans, the
Company has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Code and ERISA (including, without limitation, providing timely notices
to participants and affected employee organizations).

(e) Except as disclosed in _Section 2.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no amounts payable under the Plans will fail to be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by virtue of section 280G of the Code. Except as disclosed
in _Section 2.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or
officer of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due any such employee or officer.

Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry

"), except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be
in full force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

employees or officers maintained by Parent or Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries in which such Employee participates, to the
same extent recognized by the Company under a corresponding benefit plan

payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by any such Employees and their

or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or Merger Sub or the

_Executive Incentive Plan_ "), following the Effective Time on the Closing
Date, the Parent and Merger Sub shall, or shall cause the Surviving

the applicable Employee waiving all claims under the Executive Incentive Plan

and Parent, pay each Employee who is a participant in the Executive Incentive
Plan a cash payment in accordance with the Executive Incentive Plan in respect

Value (as defined in the Executive Incentive Plan), (B) in the case of a
Performance Unit, the value of the Performance Unit specified in the
applicable agreement governing such Award (the " _Award Agreement_ "), or (C)

value of the Performance Unit specified in the Award Agreement as applicable,
multiplied successively by each of the following: (1) the greater of such
Employees (x) target percentage, if any, specified in Award Agreement or (y)
the maximum percentage, if any, that would be earned under the terms of the
applicable Award Agreement assuming that the rate at which the performance
goals have been achieved as of the Closing Date would continue until the end
of the applicable performance period and (2) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of whole and partial months that have elapsed between the
beginning of the applicable performance period and the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of whole and partial months in the
performance period.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _Sections 4.3(a)-(d)_
shall not apply with respect to any Employee whose employment is governed by
any collective bargaining agreement in effect as of the Closing Date.

(f) No provision of this _Section 4.3_ shall be construed (i) to create a
right of any Employee to continued employment by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, or (ii) (without
limiting the generality of _Section 7.6)_ to create a right in any Employee
or beneficiary of any Employee under any benefit plan of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

will not, and it will not authorize any of its officers, directors, employees
and investment bankers, attorneys, consultants or other agents retained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Representative_ ") to, and
it will instruct all Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate
or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making or submission of any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information to, any third Person
relating to an Acquisition  



 

\- 25 -  Proposal, (iii) afford access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made, or to
the Companys Knowledge, is considering making, any Acquisition Proposal, or

agreement or understanding providing for any Acquisition Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under _Section 4.4(b)_) or (v) propose
publicly or agree to any of the foregoing relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
preceding sentence by a Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including as a result of a failure to follow the instructions
referred to above) shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 4.4(a)_ by the
Company.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 4.4(a)_, if (i) the Company receives an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
by a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment to be reasonably
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (after consulting with its outside
legal and financial advisors), taking into account any revisions to the terms
of the Merger or this Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified
pursuant to _Section 4.4(b)(ii)_ if such revisions are made during the 2
business day notice period referred to in _Section 4.4(b)(ii)_, and (ii) the
Company is not then in breach of this _Section 4.4_, the Company may, subject
to its providing 2 business days prior written notice to Parent of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal: (x) furnish
information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive to the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, provided such information is concurrently furnished to Parent in
the same form provided to such Person; and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt)
notify Parent (which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall
identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth
the material terms thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
confidential information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by

Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Parent fully informed in all material
respects of any Superior Proposal, including the status of such Superior

and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have
taken place prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

Directors, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, from withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the Company Board
Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), if (i) the Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to
effect a Change of  



 

\- 26 -  Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board
of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law and (ii) the Company provides Parent written notice of its intention to
effect a Change of Recommendation 2 business days prior to effecting a Change
of Recommendation.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position as required by Rule 14d-9 or

shall not make any disclosure or take any action that represents a Change
of Recommendation other than in compliance with _Section 4.4(c)_; _provided_
, that the Company shall not be required to comply with _Section 4.4(c)(ii)_
if (i) upon the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, such Change of
Recommendation is required by applicable Law to be disclosed sooner than 2
business days prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation, and (ii) the
Company provides as much advance written and oral notice as possible to
Parent considering such requirements of applicable Law, it being agreed that

determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial adviser, to be more favorable to the Company and its
stockholders than the Merger, (B) for which financing, to the extent
required, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors, is
reasonably capable of being obtained by such Person and (C) the conditions to
consummation of which are, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Board
of Directors, reasonably capable of being satisfied.

Section 4.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, neither the Company,  



 

\- 27 -  Parent nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall issue or

person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director, employee and agent
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of the Company and its Subsidiaries against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses), judgments, amounts paid in settlement, any such settlement
to be with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld), and fines in connection with any actual or
threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative, (each a " _Claim_ ") to the extent
that any such Claim is based on, arises out of, or pertains to (i) the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or

Effective Time, to the full extent permitted under the DGCL or the Companys
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date hereof, including provisions relating to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 4.6_, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify
an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have under this _Section 4.6_, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such party), and shall deliver to Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e) of the
DGCL. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to
represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. In the
event any Indemnified Party brings any action against Parent or the Surviving

costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

(b) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and all

are asserted or made within such six year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such Claim or Claims shall continue until

determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL, the
Companys certificate of incorporation or by-laws or such agreements, as the

Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Parent and; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.6_ shall impair any rights of
any present or former directors or officers of the Company.

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the

or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this _Section 4.6_, proper provision shall be made

assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 4.6_ and none of the
actions described in clauses (i) or (ii) shall be taken until such provision

coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former
directors or officers; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the

to pay in any one year aggregate premiums for DandO Insurance under this
_Section 4.6_ in excess of 200% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company

aggregate premiums for DandO Insurance exceed 200% of the aggregate premiums
paid by the Company in fiscal 2005 for such purposes, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase the highest level of DandO Insurance coverage
available for 200% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in fiscal
2005.

unconditionally consents to service of process in any such action by notice
in accordance with _Section 7.3_.

Section 7.9 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each non-

remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific
performance of this Agreement in any action instituted in a court of

(other than its obligations under _Section 1.8(a)_ hereof) to (a) Fruit of
the Loom, Inc. (" _Fruit_ ") or (b) to any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent;  _provided_ , that, in such case, Parent will
cause Fruit to guarantee the performance by any such direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parents obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only, and will be given
no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

Section 7.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
