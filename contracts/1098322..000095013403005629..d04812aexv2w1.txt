                  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 9, 2003 (this
"Agreement"), by and among USA INTERACTIVE, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
HERMITAGE MERGER CORP., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and HOTELS.COM, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

                                   WITNESSETH:

                  WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub, and the
Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders that Parent and the Company enter into a business
combination pursuant to which Parent would acquire the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company that it does not already own;

                  WHEREAS, to effect such business combination, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Statute"), Sub will merge with and into
the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the
"Merger");

                  WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

                  WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution hereof, Parent has
entered into an amendment to that certain Amended and Restated Asset Purchase
Agreement by and among the Company, Parent, TMF, Inc., HRN Marketing Corp.,
David Litman and Robert Diener, providing for the transfer restrictions on the
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them to continue with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock received in respect of their shares of
restricted Company Common Stock;

                  WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and

                  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has established
a Special Committee thereof (the "Special Committee") and has delegated to the
Special Committee the authority to, among other things, negotiate the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, retain separate outside legal counsel and a
separate financial advisor and recommend to the full Board of Directors of the
Company whether the Board of Directors of the Company should approve and declare
the advisability of this Agreement; and

                  WHEREAS, the Special Committee, after having consulted with
its legal and financial advisors, has determined that the Merger is fair to, and
in the best interests of, the holders of Company Common Stock (as defined
herein) other than Parent and its subsidiaries, and has recommended to the full
Board of Directors of the Company that the Board of Directors of the Company
approve and declare the advisability of this Agreement, and a majority of the
directors of the Company has approved and declared the advisability of this
Agreement;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

                  SECTION 1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Statute, at the
Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the
Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease. Sub and
the Company are collectively referred to as the "Constituent Corporations."

                  SECTION 1.2. EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, the Merger shall become effective (the "Effective
Time") upon the filing of a properly executed certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the Delaware Statute, or at such later time as agreed to by the
parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

                  SECTION 1.3. CLOSING. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date (the "Closing Date") to be mutually
agreed upon by the parties hereto, which date shall be no later than the third
Business Day after satisfaction of the latest to occur of the conditions set
forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing), unless another date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. "Business Day" shall mean
any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday on which banks are
permitted to close in the City and State of New York.

                  SECTION 1.4. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time: (a)
the separate existence of Sub shall cease and Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, with the result that the Company shall be the Surviving
Corporation, and (b) the Merger shall have all of the effects provided by the
Delaware Statute.

                  SECTION 1.5. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF
SURVIVING CORPORATION; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. At the Effective Time, (a) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in
its entirety in the form set forth as Exhibit A hereto, and, as so amended,
until thereafter and further amended as provided therein and under the Delaware
Statute it shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, (b) the Bylaws of Sub shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until altered, amended or repealed as provided under the Delaware
Statute or in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, (c) the directors of Sub shall become the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, such directors to hold office from the Effective Time
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed as provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and
(d) the officers of the Company shall continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until such time as their respective successors are duly elected as
provided in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

                                    ARTICLE 2

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

                  SECTION 2.1. EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the
Effective Time, subject and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Constituent Corporations
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Constituent Corporations:

                  (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Sub ("Sub Common Stock") shall be
converted into and exchanged for a one share of common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock")
with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (b) Treatment of Certain Company Shares. Each share of Class A
common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock")
that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or by Parent, and each share of
Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company ("Company Class B
Common Stock"), shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

                  (c) Exchange Ratio for Company Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Common Stock subject to Section 2.1(b)) shall,
subject to Section 2.1(d), be converted into the right to receive 2.4 (the
"Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration").
At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding, and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued; and, in
lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2(e).

                  (d) Adjustment of Exchange Ratio for Dilution and Other
Matters. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into, or
exercisable or exchangeable for, Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
stock combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or otherwise, as the case
may be, or either Parent or the Company declares any other dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock,
respectively, with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time, then the
Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall, without duplication, be
correspondingly adjusted.

                  SECTION 2.2. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

                  (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
select the Bank of New York or another bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange
Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund") issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) at the Effective Time in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, which shall include such shares of Parent Common
Stock to be sold by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(e).

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record (other than the Company, Parent, Sub and any wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company) of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(collectively, the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to
receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 2 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which
is not registered on the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued and paid to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Article 2 and the Delaware
Statute. The consideration to be issued in the Merger will be delivered by the
Exchange Agent as promptly as practicable following surrender of a Certificate
and any other required documents. No interest will be payable on such
consideration, regardless of any delay in making payments.

                  (c) Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered


                                      -4-
<PAGE>


Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e) until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect, if any, of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor or such holder's transferee
pursuant to Section 2.2(e), without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount
of dividends or other distributions on Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions on Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 (plus any
cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2.

                  (e) No Issuance of Fractional Shares.

                      (i) No certificates or scrip for fractional shares of
         Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
         Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
         owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

                      (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective
         Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number
         of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent
         by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) over (B) the aggregate number of
         full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of
         Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (such excess, the
         "Excess Shares"). As soon after the Effective Time as practicable, the
         Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock, shall
         sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices in the
         over-the-counter market, all in the manner provided in clause (iii) of
         this Section 2.2(e).

                      (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent
         shall be executed in the over-the-counter market through one or more
         member firms of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
         (the "NASD") and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
         practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been


                                      -5-
<PAGE>


         distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
         will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Company Common
         Stock (the "Common Shares Trust"). Parent shall pay all commissions,
         transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
         expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection
         with such sale of the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine
         the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Company
         Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of
         the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
         fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
         interest to which such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled and
         the denominator of which is the Excess Shares.

                      (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the
         amount of cash, if any, to be paid to the holders of Company Common
         Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests and subject to clause
         (v) of this Section 2.2(e), the Exchange Agent shall make available
         such amounts to such holders of Company Common Stock.

                      (v) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
         deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
         to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such
         amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
         withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
         any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
         amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
         amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
         been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
         respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or
         the Exchange Agent.

                  (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund and Common Shares Trust that remains undistributed to the stockholders of
the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Company that have not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock.

                  (g) No Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may
be, for shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the
Exchange Fund or cash from the Common Shares Trust delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
Subject to applicable law and public policy, if any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, then any Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and public
policy, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

<PAGE>


                  (h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates shall execute an affidavit of that fact upon
request. The holder of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates shall
also deliver a reasonable indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed. The affidavit and any indemnity that may be
required hereunder shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent, who shall be
responsible for making payment for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate(s).

                  SECTION 2.3. STOCK COMPENSATION AWARDS.

                  (a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a
"Company Option") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the
Company (the "Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock (a "Parent Option") on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option. The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each such Parent Option shall be the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to
the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Option shall
have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per
share exercise price specified in such Company Option divided by the Exchange
Ratio; provided, however, that, in the case of any Company Option to which
Section 421 of the Code applies immediately prior to the Effective Time by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price,
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent
or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any
kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under the Stock Plans
(including restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and
dividend equivalents), other than Company Options (each, a "Company Stock-Based
Award"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time,
into a right or award with respect to Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock-Based
Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company
Stock-Based Awards. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
such Parent Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock-Based Award, multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent
Common Stock. All dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder of
a Company Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited to
such holder's account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.


                                      -7-
<PAGE>


                  (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the holders of Company Options and Company Stock-Based Awards
appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the
respective Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such Company
Options and the Company Stock-Based Awards, and stating that such Company
Options and Company Stock-Based Awards and agreements have been assumed by
Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger
and the terms of the Stock Plans).

                  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary action for the adjustment of the Company Options and the Company
Stock-Based Awards under this Section 2.3. Parent shall reserve for issuance a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Parent Options and Parent
Stock-Based Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 2.3.
As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event not later
than two Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not
available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such Parent Options and Parent Stock-Based Awards and shall
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Parent Options or Parent Stock-Based
Awards remain outstanding.

                  SECTION 2.4. COMPANY WARRANTS. Each warrant to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (a "Company Warrant") granted under a warrant agreement
of the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock and shall at the election of Parent and at the Effective
Time, either represent a right to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock or be
converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent
Warrant"), in each case on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Warrant. The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each such Company Warrant or Parent Warrant, as the case may
be, shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent
Common Stock, and such Company Warrant or Parent Warrant, as the case may be
shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to
the per share exercise price specified in such Company Warrant divided by the
Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment to the number of
shares receivable upon exercise of a Parent Warrant or a Company Warrant or to
the exercise price pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall not be duplicative of any
such adjustments that occur pursuant to the terms of the underlying Company
Warrant.

                  SECTION 2.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, or to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise establish in the Surviving Corporation full right, title and interest
in, to or under any of the assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of each of the
Constituent Corporations or otherwise to take all such lawful and reasonably
necessary or desirable action.

                                    ARTICLE 3

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as
follows:

                  SECTION 3.1. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. Each of the
Company and its "Significant Subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and which are
referred to herein as the "Company Significant Subsidiaries") is a corporation
or other entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and, as
applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, and has the requisite corporate or other power
and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and the
Company Significant Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to
own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is, as applicable, duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean any change, event or effect that is materially adverse to the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, excluding (i) any changes or effects resulting
from any matter, which matter has been or is expressly approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company unless, with respect to such matter, the directors of
the Company who are also executive officers of Parent either voted against or
abstained from voting (such matter and related contemplated transactions, an
"Approved Matter"), (ii) changes in economic or regulatory conditions in the
industries in which the Company carries on business as of the date hereof, and
changes in general economic, regulatory or political conditions, including,
without limitation, acts of war or terrorism, and (iii) changes resulting from
the announcement of the Transactions and any other public announcement of Parent
during the term of this Agreement to the extent not covered in any other public
announcement of the Company during the term of this Agreement or based upon
information provided to Parent by the Company. Other than wholly owned
subsidiaries and except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports or Section 3.1
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not directly or indirectly
own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other
business, association or entity.

                  SECTION 3.2. CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists solely of 600,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock,
150,000,000 shares of Company Class B Common Stock, and 20,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Preferred
Stock"). No shares of Company Preferred Stock


                                      -9-
<PAGE>


are issued or outstanding. At the close of business on April 4, 2003, (a)
17,936,574 shares of Company Common Stock and 38,999,100 shares of Company Class
B Common Stock were issued and outstanding, and (b) 1,606,394 shares of Company
Common Stock and no shares of Company Class B Common Stock were held in treasury
by the Company or by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. All shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding on the date hereof are duly authorized, validly issued and fully
paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in this Section 3.2 or as disclosed
in Section 3.2 of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on or
prior to the date hereof (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), as of April 4, 2003,
there are no options, warrants, rights, puts, calls, commitments, or other
contracts, arrangements or understandings issued by or binding upon the Company
requiring or providing for, and there are no outstanding debt or equity
securities of the Company which upon the conversion, exchange or exercise
thereof would require or provide for the issuance by the Company of any new or
additional shares of Company Common Stock, Company Class B Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock (or any other securities of the Company) which, with or
without notice, lapse of time and/or payment of monies, are or would be
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Class B Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (or any other
securities of the Company). Since April 4, 2003, the Company has not issued any
shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable
for any shares of its capital stock, other than pursuant to the exercise of
employee stock options granted prior to such date or in connection with the
conversion, if any, of shares of Company Class B Common Stock into shares of
Company Common Stock. There are no preemptive or other similar rights available
to the existing holders of Company Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock.

                  SECTION 3.3. AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT; BOARD
APPROVAL.

                  (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder and, subject to obtaining the approval of the stockholders of the
Company of this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Transactions"). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other
than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of this Agreement by the holders
of a majority of the voting power of Company Common Stock and Company Class B
Common Stock, voting together as a single class, which approval is the only
approval required to consummate the Transactions under the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation and the Delaware Statute). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Sub, constitutes the legal
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) the availability of specific performance or
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

                  (b) The Board of Directors of the Company, based on the
recommendation of the Special Committee (which recommendation was a condition to
the approval of the Company's


                                      -10-
<PAGE>


Board of Directors set forth in clause (i) of this sentence) has, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, (i) approved this Agreement and the Transactions
(including for purposes of Section 144 of the Delaware Statute), (ii) determined
that the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of its public
stockholders, (iii) declared this Agreement and the Transactions advisable, and
(iv) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement and
the Transactions. This Agreement and the Transactions have been approved by the
unanimous vote of the members of the Special Committee, the unanimous vote of
the members of the Board of Directors of the Company (excluding the directors of
the Company that are also directors or officers of Parent), and by the vote of a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

                  SECTION 3.4. NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.

                  (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the Transactions by the Company will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of the Company or any of the Company Significant Subsidiaries; (ii)
subject to obtaining the approval of the Company's stockholders of this
Agreement in accordance with the Delaware Statute and the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws and compliance with the requirements set forth in
Section 3.4(b), conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by
which any of their respective properties is bound or affected; or (iii) except
as set forth in Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, result in any
breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or alter the rights or obligations of any
third party or the Company or its subsidiaries under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, increased payments or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any
of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties are bound or affected, in
each case having value or requiring payments over the term thereof equal to or
greater than $2.5 million, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for any
such conflicts or violations that would not prevent or delay consummation of the
Merger in any material respect, or otherwise prevent the Company from performing
its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect, and would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all material consents,
waivers and approvals under any agreements, contracts, licenses or leases
required to be obtained by the Company or the Company Significant Subsidiaries
in connection with entering into of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions.

                  (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the Transactions by the Company will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or registration or filing with or
notification to, any court, administrative agency, commission, governmental or
regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), except (i)
the filing of documents to satisfy the applicable requirements, if any, of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,


                                      -11-
<PAGE>


as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and state takeover laws, (ii) the filing and
effectiveness of the S-4, including the Information Statement/Prospectus in
definitive form relating to the Transactions, (iii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate corresponding documents with the Secretary of State of other states
in which the Company is qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation,
(iv) filings under the rules and regulations of the NASD, and (v) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications (A) would not prevent or delay consummation
of the Merger in any material respect or otherwise prevent or delay in any
material respect the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement or (B) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.5. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

                  Except as set forth in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in conflict with, or
in default or violation of (a) any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which any of
their respective properties is bound, or (b) whether after the giving of notice
or passage of time or both, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is
bound, except for any conflicts, defaults or violations that do not and would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.6. SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                  (a) The Company has made available to Parent a correct and
complete copy of each report, schedule, registration statement (but only such
registration statements that have become effective prior to the date hereof) and
definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC on or since January
1, 2002 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company SEC Reports"),
which are all the forms, reports and documents required to be filed by the
Company with the SEC since such date; provided that, if the Company amends any
of the Company SEC Reports, such amendment shall not mean or imply that any
representation or warranty in this Agreement was not true when made or became
untrue thereafter. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports and any
forms, reports and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC after the
date of this Agreement (i) complied or will comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of

benefits under any "employee pension plan" (as such term is defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA, (C) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the
books of the Company or its subsidiaries, or (D) benefits the full cost of which
is borne by the current or former employee or director (or his beneficiary), and
(vi) to the best knowledge of the Company there are no pending, threatened or
anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or
against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto.

of its affiliates from the Company or any of its affiliates under any Company
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Company Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefits, except for any payments or vesting
which would occur upon a termination of employment absent the consummation of
the Transactions or which arise under any plan, agreement or arrangement offered
or maintained by Parent.

                  SECTION 3.11. TAX MATTERS. Neither the Company nor any of its

Merger from constituting a reorganization qualifying under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  SECTION 3.12. LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports or Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no
claims, actions, suits, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, before any court, arbitrator or administrative, governmental or
regulatory authority or body, domestic or foreign, that, individually or in the
aggregate, would, or would reasonably be anticipated to, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

                  Parent and Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Company, as follows:

                  SECTION 4.1. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. Each of Parent,
Sub and Parent's "Significant Subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC), other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the
"Parent Significant Subsidiaries") has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted. Each of Parent and the Parent Significant Subsidiaries
is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary to own, lease
and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents,
certificates, approvals and orders would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent, Sub and the Parent
Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be
so duly licensed or qualified and in good standing that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. "Parent Material
Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, event or effect that is materially
adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, in each case excluding (i) changes in
economic or regulatory conditions in the industries in which Parent carries on
business as of the date hereof,


                                      -15-

without limitation, acts of war or terrorism, and (ii) changes resulting from
the announcement of the Transactions and any other public announcement of the
Company during the term of this Agreement.

Letter"), or in connection with the agreements described in the Parent Proxy
Statement, as of March 31, 2003, (y) there were no options, warrants, rights,
puts, calls, commitments or other contracts, arrangements or understandings
issued by or binding upon Parent requiring or providing for, and (z) there are
no outstanding debt or equity securities of Parent which upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise thereof would require or provide for the issuance by Parent
of any new or additional shares of Parent Common Stock (or any other securities
of Parent) which, with or without notice, lapse of time and/or payment of
monies, are or would be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Parent Common Stock (or any other securities of Parent). Since March 31, 2003
through the date hereof, Parent has not issued any shares of its capital stock
or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of its capital
stock, other than as disclosed in Section 4.2 to the Company Disclosure

Merger). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent and Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) the availability of
specific performance or injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

                  (b) The Board of Directors of Parent has (i) approved this
Agreement and the Transactions and (ii) determined that the Transactions are
fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of Parent. Parent has not
taken any action in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company that would
cause Section 203 of the Delaware Statute to be applicable to this Agreement. No

with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of Parent or Sub; (ii) subject to compliance with the
requirements set forth in Section 4.4(b), conflict with or violate any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or Sub or by
which their respective properties are bound or affected; or (iii) result in any
breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under, or alter the rights or obligations of any
third party or of Parent or Sub under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration, increased payments or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any of the properties
or assets of Parent or Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Sub is a party or by which Parent or Sub or any of
their respective properties are bound or affected, except in the cases of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other alterations or occurrences that would not prevent or delay
consummation of the Merger in any material respect, or otherwise prevent Parent

approvals under any agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be
obtained by Parent or Sub in connection with entering into of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions.

                  (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Sub do not, and the performance of their respective obligations hereunder and

consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or registration or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity except (i) the filing of documents to
satisfy the applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act and state
takeover laws, (ii) the filing and effectiveness of the S-4, including the
Information Statement/Prospectus, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate
corresponding documents with the Secretary of State of other states in which the
Company is qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation, (iv) filings
under the rules and regulations of the NASD, (v) filings under state securities
laws, and (vi) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications (A) would
not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger in any material respect or
otherwise prevent or delay in any material respect Parent or Sub from performing
their respective obligations under this Agreement or (B) would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 4.5. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except as set forth in
Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of (a) any law,

proxy statement filed by Parent with the SEC on or after January 1, 2002 and
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Parent SEC Reports"), which are all
the forms, reports and documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC
since such date; provided that, if Parent amends any of the Parent SEC Reports,
such amendment shall not mean or imply that any representation or warranty in
this Agreement was not true when made or became untrue thereafter. As of their
respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports and any forms, reports and other
documents filed by Parent and Sub after the date of this Agreement (i) complied
or will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities

                  SECTION 5.3. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF PARENT. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Parent Disclosure Letter), and
agreements described in the Parent Proxy Statement or any Parent SEC Report,
during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
Effective Time or until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1, Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, take
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions
to the Transactions set forth in Article 6 not being satisfied.

                  SECTION 5.4. PREPARATION OF S-4 AND INFORMATION STATEMENT;
OTHER FILINGS. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the
S-4, which shall include a preliminary information statement of the Company
relating to the Merger as well as a prospectus of Parent. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the
SEC, to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to cause the information statement of the
Company and prospectus of Parent in definitive form (as supplemented or amended
prior to the Effective Time, the "Information Statement/Prospectus") to be
mailed to the Company's stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. At the option of Parent,
Parent may combine the Information Statement/Prospectus with the proxy and
information statement/prospectus relating to USA's acquisition of Expedia, Inc.
As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall prepare and file any other filings


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


required under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other federal laws
relating to the Transactions (the "Other Filings"). Each of the Company and
Parent will notify each other promptly upon the receipt of any comments, whether
oral or written, from the SEC or its staff and upon any request by the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the
S-4 or the Information Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing or for
additional information, and will supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with
respect to the S-4, the Information Statement/Prospectus or the Merger. No
amendment or supplement to the Information Statement/Prospectus or S-4 will be
made by the Company or Parent without the prior approval of the other party,
except as required by applicable laws and then only to the extent necessary, or
without providing the other party the opportunity to review and comment thereon.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the S-4 has been declared effective, the issuance of any stop
order, or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. If, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the S-4, the Information Statement/Prospectus or any Other
Filing so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or an event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Information Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 or any
Other Filing, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party and an amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the Company's stockholders. The Company and Parent each shall promptly
provide the other (or its counsel) copies of all filings made by it with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

                  SECTION 5.5. WRITTEN CONSENT.

                  (a) Parent agrees that immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, it shall deliver to the Company a duly executed
irrevocable written consent with respect to all shares of Company Class B Common
Stock owned by it adopting the Agreement as approved by the Board of Directors
of the Company. Parent agrees that it shall not transfer, other than to an
affiliate of Parent, any shares of Company Class B Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent on the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If this
Agreement is subsequently amended and such amendment is approved by the Board of
Directors of Parent and the Company or if a subsequent consent is deemed
necessary to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
Parent shall as soon thereafter as practicable either (a) execute and deliver a
written consent with respect to all shares of Company Class B Common Stock owned
directly or indirectly by it on the date hereof adopting this Agreement, or (b)
at a meeting of the Company's stockholders at which any proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement is proposed, cause all shares of Company Class B Common Stock
owned directly or indirectly by it on the date hereof (i) to appear, in person
or by proxy, so that all such shares are counted for the purpose of obtaining a
quorum at any such meeting of stockholders of the Company, and at any
adjournment or


                                      -23-
<PAGE>


adjournments thereof, and (ii) to vote, in person or by proxy, with respect to
such shares to adopt such amendment to this Agreement. Parent shall cause all
shares of Company Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by it on the
date hereof to vote against, and refrain from executing and delivering written
consents in favor of, any proposal that is contrary to the adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby. Following delivery of any
written consent of Parent contemplated by this Section 5.5, the Company shall
promptly provide to its stockholders the notice required pursuant to Section
228(e) of the Delaware Statute.

                  (b) Parent agrees that immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, it shall deliver to Sub a duly executed irrevocable
written consent (with a copy being delivered to the Company) with respect to all
shares of Sub Common Stock owned by it adopting the Agreement as approved by the
Board of Directors of Sub.

                  SECTION 5.6. AGREEMENTS TO TAKE REASONABLE ACTION.

                  (a) The parties shall take, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to take, all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with
all legal requirements which may be imposed on them with respect to the Merger
and shall take all reasonable actions necessary to cooperate promptly with and
furnish information to the other parties in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon them or any of their subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger. Each party shall take, and shall cause its subsidiaries to take, all
reasonable actions necessary (i) to obtain (and will take all reasonable actions
necessary to promptly cooperate with the other parties in obtaining) any
clearance, consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity, or other third party, required to be obtained or made
by it (or by the other parties or any of their respective subsidiaries) in
connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) to lift, rescind or mitigate the effect of any injunction
or restraining order or other order adversely affecting its ability to
consummate the Transactions; (iii) to fulfill all conditions applicable to the
parties pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) to prevent, with respect to a
threatened or pending temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order, the
entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be; (v) to defend any
lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging the Agreement, the consummation of the Transactions or the terms
thereof; and (vi) to execute and deliver any additional agreements or
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and fully carry out the
purposes of the Agreement provided, however, that with respect to clauses (i)
through (vi) above, the parties will take only such curative measures (such as
licensing and divestiture) as the parties determine to be reasonable.

                  (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Merger, subject to the appropriate
approval of the stockholders of the Company.

                  SECTION 5.7. CONSENTS. Parent and the Company shall each use
all reasonable efforts to obtain the consent and approval of, or effect the
notification of or filing with, each


                                      -24-
<PAGE>


person or authority whose consent or approval is required in order to permit the
consummation of the Merger and the Transactions and to enable Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to conduct and operate the business of Parent and the
Company and their respective subsidiaries substantially as presently conducted
and as contemplated to be conducted.

                  SECTION 5.8. NASDAQ QUOTATION. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
stockholders of the Company in the Merger (including the shares of Parent Common
Stock reserved for issuance with respect to Company Stock Options and Company
Stock-Based Awards) to be eligible for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market
(or other national market or exchange on which Parent Common Stock is then
traded or quoted) prior to the Effective Time.

                  SECTION 5.9. AFFILIATES. At least ten Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of
names and addresses of those persons who, on the date hereof, are "affiliates"
of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and
applicable rules and regulations. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Effective
Time, from each of the affiliates of the Company identified in the foregoing
list, agreements substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit
B.

                  SECTION 5.10. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) Parent shall maintain in effect for the benefit of
individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of
the Company the current provisions regarding indemnification and exculpation of
officers and directors (including with respect to advancement of expenses)
contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company on the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or otherwise
repealed for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the Effective Time of
such individuals, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time
by applicable law and then only to the minimum extent required by such
applicable law or except to make changes permitted by applicable law that would
enlarge the exculpation or rights of indemnification thereunder; provided,
however, that if any claims are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification (and to advancement of expenses) hereunder in
respect of such claims shall continue, without diminution, until disposition of
all such claims.

                  (b) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to), to the maximum extent permitted under applicable
law, provide to the current directors and officers of the Company the maximum
indemnification protection (including with respect to advancement of expenses,
including advancing expenses as incurred) permitted under the Delaware Statute
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that
if any claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification (and to advancement of expenses) hereunder in respect of such
claims shall continue, without diminution, until disposition of all such claims.

                  (c) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) assume, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant


                                      -25-
<PAGE>


to any indemnification agreements, including those contained in employment
agreements (the employee parties under such agreements being referred to as the
"Covered Persons") with the Company's directors, officers and other employees
(if any) existing at the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Company's current and former directors
and officers who are currently covered by the Company's existing insurance and
indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy (including,
without limitation, by arranging for run-off coverage, if necessary) that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the
"D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the existing policy (it being
acknowledged and understood that the Company currently self-insures for legally
indemnifiable claims and maintains liability insurance solely for claims not so
indemnifiable or in circumstances in which the Company cannot provide
indemnification), or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the most advantageous D&O Insurance obtainable for an annual
premium equal to 200% of the annual premium currently in place for the Company
for such insurance; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess
of 200% of the annual premium currently in place for the Company for such
insurance, calculated on the basis of a fair allocation of the portion of such
premium if Parent arranges such coverage on a group basis.

                  (d) This Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time, is
intended to benefit the Surviving Corporation and the Covered Persons and shall
be enforceable by the Covered Persons, their heirs, assigns and representatives
and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise. In the event the Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, or at
Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.10.

                  SECTION 5.11. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each of the
Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur would be likely to cause (a) any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, or (b) any material
failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

                  SECTION 5.12. EMPLOYEE AGREEMENTS. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill all
written employment, severance, termination, consulting and retirement
agreements, as in effect on the date hereof, to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party, pursuant to the terms thereof and applicable law.


                                      -26-

                  SECTION 5.13. REORGANIZATION. From and after the date hereof,
each of Parent and the Company and their respective subsidiaries shall not, and
shall use reasonable efforts to cause their affiliates not to, take any action,
or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would jeopardize
qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement that would have such effect. Each of Parent and the Company shall,
and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts
to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Section 6.2(c) and 6.3(c),
including the execution of the officers' certificates referred to therein.

                  SECTION 5.14. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release
relating to the Transactions shall be a joint press release, to be agreed upon
by the Parent and the Company (including the Special Committee). Thereafter and
until the Closing, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable efforts to
consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

                  SECTION 5.15. STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. Each of the Company and
the Parent shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to participate in the
defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company or the Parent and
their respective directors and officers, as applicable, relating to the
Transactions or this Agreement.

                  SECTION 5.16. SECTION 16B-3. Parent and the Company shall take
all reasonable steps to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.3 and
any other disposition of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent by each individual
who (a) is a director or officer of the Company, or (b) at the Effective Time
will become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         effective by the SEC under the Securities Act and shall not be the
         subject of any stop order or proceeding by the SEC seeking a stop
         order.

                  (c) Governmental Entity Approvals. All material
         authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or
         filings with, or expiration of waiting periods imposed by, any
         Governmental Entity, if any, necessary for the consummation of the
         Merger shall have been filed, expired or been obtained, other than
         those that, individually or in the aggregate, the failure to be filed,
         expired or obtained would not be reasonably expected to have a Parent
         Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect.


                                      -27-

                  (d) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No temporary
         restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
         issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint
         or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in
         effect, nor shall any proceeding brought by a Governmental Entity be
         pending which would reasonably be expected to restrain or prohibit the
         consummation of the Merger; and there shall not be any action taken, or
         any statute, rule, regulation or order (whether temporary, preliminary
         or permanent) enacted, entered or enforced which makes the consummation
         of the Merger illegal or prevents or prohibits the Merger.

                  (e) Nasdaq Quotation. The shares of Parent Common Stock
         issuable to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
         (including the shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance with
         respect to Company Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards) shall
         have been authorized for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market (or
         other national market or exchange on which Parent Common Stock is then
         traded or quoted), upon official notice of issuance.

                  SECTION 6.2. CONDITIONS OF OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND SUB. The
obligations of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction of the following additional conditions, unless waived in writing by
Parent:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. (i) The representations
         and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.7 shall
         be true and correct as of the Closing Date as if made on such date
         (except with respect to Section 3.2 for inaccuracies that are not
         significant in amount and to Section 3.7 for inaccuracies on the date
         the S-4 is initially filed), (ii) except to the extent that the failure
         of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
         Agreement to be true and correct, in the aggregate, would not have a
         Company Material Adverse Effect, the representations and warranties of
         the Company made in this Agreement, without regard to any materiality
         or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification therein, shall be true and
         correct as of the date hereof, and (iii) Parent shall have received a
         certificate signed by a senior executive officer of the Company
         certifying the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in clauses (i)
         and (ii) of this Section 6.2(a).

                  (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company
         shall have performed in all material respects all of its obligations
         and covenants, taken as a whole, required to be performed by it under

         have received a certificate to such effect signed by a senior executive
         officer of the Company.

                  (c) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received a written opinion
         of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, special counsel to Parent, dated the
         Closing Date, to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes
         the Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
         Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel to
         Parent shall be entitled to rely upon customary assumptions and

                  SECTION 6.3. CONDITIONS OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The
obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of
the following conditions, unless waived in writing by the Company:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. (i) The representations
         and warranties of Parent set forth in Section 4.7 shall be true and
         correct as of the Closing Date as if made on such date, (ii) the
         representations and warranties of Parent set forth in Section 4.2 shall
         be true and correct as of the date hereof (except for inaccuracies that
         are not significant in amount and to Section 4.7 for inaccuracies on
         the date the S-4 is initially filed), and (iii) except to the extent
         that the failure of the representations and warranties of Parent and
         Sub set forth in this Agreement to be true and correct, in the
         aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the
         representations and warranties of Parent and Sub made in this
         Agreement, without regard to any materiality or "Material Adverse
         Effect" qualification therein, shall be true and correct as of the date
         hereof, and (iii) the Company shall have received a certificate signed
         by a senior executive officer of Parent certifying the fulfillment of
         the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section
         6.3(a).

                  (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub. Each of
         Parent and Sub shall have performed in all material respects all of
         their respective obligations and covenants, taken as a whole, required
         to be performed by such party under this Agreement prior to or as of
         the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate to
         such effect signed by a senior executive officer of Parent.

                  (c) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have received a written
         opinion of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P., special counsel
         to the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that for U.S.
         federal income tax purposes the Merger will constitute a
         "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In
         rendering such opinion, counsel to the Company shall be entitled to
         rely upon customary assumptions and representations reasonably
         satisfactory to such counsel, including representations set forth in
         certificates of officers of Parent and the Company.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                                   TERMINATION

                  SECTION 7.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

                  (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Board of
         Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of the Company;

                  (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not
         have been consummated by November 15, 2003 (provided, that the right to
         terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
         available to any party whose action or failure to act has been the
         cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before
         such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
         this Agreement);


                                      -29-
<PAGE>


                  (c) by either Parent or the Company, if a court of competent
         jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order,
         decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case having the
         effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
         the Merger, which order, decree or ruling is final and nonappealable;

                  (d) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation,
         warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this
         Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or
         Section 6.3(b) shall have become incapable of fulfillment and such
         breach shall not have been waived by the Company; or

                  (e) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
         covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
         Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
         Section 6.2(b) shall have become incapable of fulfillment and such
         breach shall not have been waived by Parent.

Any termination pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall, in the case of the Company
or the Board of Directors of the Company, be based on the recommendation of the
Special Committee.

                  SECTION 7.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
be of no further force or effect, except (a) as set forth in the last sentence
of this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, and Article 8, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 7.3. FEES AND EXPENSES. All fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

                  SECTION 8.1. AMENDMENT. This Agreement (including the Exhibits
and Disclosure Letters hereto) may be amended prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and the Company, by action taken by the Board of Directors of Parent and
the Board of Directors of the Company (provided, that no amendment shall be
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company unless such amendment shall
have been recommended by the Special Committee and, when applicable, approved by
the disinterested directors of the Company), at any time before or after
approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

                  SECTION 8.2. EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the
Effective Time (whether before or after approval of the stockholders of the
Company), Parent and the Company


                                      -30-
<PAGE>


may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any extension or waiver on behalf of the Company
shall be taken only upon the recommendation of the Special Committee (and, when
applicable, by the disinterested directors of the Company). Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

                  SECTION 8.3. NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
AGREEMENTS. All representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement or
in any instrument or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not
survive the Merger, except for the agreements contained in Article 1 (The
Merger), Article 2 (Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent
Corporations; Exchange of Certificates), Section 5.10 (Indemnification), 5.12
(Employee Agreements), 5.13 (Reorganization) and Article 8 (General Provisions),
each of which shall survive the Merger.

                  SECTION 8.4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and disclosure letters hereto) contains the entire agreement among all
of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior arrangements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect
thereto, but shall not supersede any agreements among any group of the parties
hereto entered into on or after the date hereof.

                  SECTION 8.5. SEVERABILITY. It is the desire and intent of the
parties that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in
which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, in the event that any provision of
this Agreement would be held in any jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be
ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more
narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such
jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 8.6. NOTICES. All notices and other communications
pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be
sufficient if contained in a written instrument and shall be deemed given if
delivered personally, telecopied, sent by nationally recognized, overnight
courier or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested),
postage prepaid, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other
